Another crucial step for the Balkans
Since the world has been focused on Iraq, North Korea and a possible crisis with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo has gone somewhat unnoticed.
The public will soon have the opportunity to turn its attention once again toward this province when the decision is made regarding its fate .
The United States and their European friends have repeatedly stated their intention to take before the end of the year the difficult decision to separate or not Kosovo from Serbia . 
This decision, crucial to the future of an unstable region, will test Western resolve and unity.
The talks this year in Vienna, orchestrated by the United Nations, have shown that an agreement between Serbia and Kosovo on a "final status" will not happen.
Negotiations are continuing , but , UN negotiator and former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari said very tactfully in the Security Council , they are in actual fact dead .
No Serbian leader will accept the independence of Kosovo because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country . 
Indeed, the Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, has made every effort to undermine the interim government of Kosovo.
He is eager to hold a national referendum this very month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual prior training the public . 
The main objective of this new constitution consists in the preamble, which maintains Kosovo in its status as an inalienable part of Serbia.
The Kosovo Albanians have said they will accept no link with Serbia, so tiny that it is.
Throughout the 1990s, they are virtually out of Kosovo managed by the Serbs in creating parallel institutions.
Their mass forced exodus in 1999 and the NATO intervention that followed , putting an end to the Serbian reign and establishing a quasi state under the auspices of the UN , has made any solution other than that of independence intolerable . 
A month or two from now , the Contact Group in the Balkans , the United States , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Italy and Russia , will consider the recommendations of Ahtisaari on the final status of Kosovo and will perhaps offer a solution to the Security Council , which must make the final decision . 
In public , all members of the contact group attempted to leave the question of Kosovo's final status open , but in private the United States and some of its allies told the two parties they propose the independence this year . 
Some members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, see a dim view of or remain sceptical about a solution imposed, and few governments are for the division of another country, compelling person under any circumstances.
The choice by the Security Council to approve independence depends largely on the possibility of preventing a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic efforts.
The nature of the independence granted also has its . 
Independent Kosovo should be able to live in safety and its minorities should be protected . 
The north of Kosovo today largely under the control of Belgrade, should not be partitioned to fully does not name.
In order to reduce the blow dealt to Serbia , the Security Council must avoid granting independence in such a convoluted that the new État cannot really function . 
If the Security Council fails to take a decision on a final status, it will create a critical situation: Kosovo will declare independence unilaterally and all nations must decide not to recognise the new État.
If that happens, it is highly likely that the Serbs in northern Kosovo will declare their own independence.
At least, Serbia will greatly campaign against any recognition.
In Indeed , the government of Serbia is already trying to convince the West to defer the decision until mid 2007 .
He claims that if Kosovo becomes independent , the ultra nationalist Radical Party will rise to power in the coming elections , he believes that holding elections this year will prompt the Contact Group to reject his proposal in the Security Council .
Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of the Republika Srpska from Bosnia to threaten to hold their own referendum on the separation from a still fragile Bosnia.
And they keep pressing in vain for the referral of Ahtisaari in order to extend discussions Vienna . 
The timing for the organisation of the constitutional referendum appears to be part of this dilatory strategy.
Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and will push the West to reconsider the independence of Kosovo.
This tactic may be working.
Many EU countries are worried about the implications of the withdrawal of territory from of a country, as well as the impact of the independence of Kosovo on Serbian Democracy.
Being given the political instability of Serbia, they put in doubt the damage that would cause a delay in the short term, which would be mainly self-inflicted.
But delaying the decision would only allow Kostunica to find new ways to make even more difficult a decision by the Security Council.
The West should ignore the siren song of Belgrade.
Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable in the near future, and the Serbian politicians will try to use this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.
Similarly, establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo, whatever the circumstances, will be problematic.
But a failure to vote today to a final on the final status of Kosovo will have a worse situation in the Balkans, will hamper the progress of Serbia to the West and joining the EU, blames the Kosovo's ethnic minorities in a dangerous ambiguity and will jeopardise the États fragile as Bosnia and Macedonia.
The only realistic option for Kosovo is independence.
If Serbia wants to rejoin the West, it must not relinquish this opportunity by letting itself get trapped by its nationalist past.

A new and dangerous for South Korea . 
North Korea's decision to expel the UN atomic energy inspectors is one more reason to consider the election of Roh Moo Hyun to the presidency of South Korea two weeks earlier as a historic landslide.
The start of its mandate is not only with one of the more dangerous episodes of the Korean peninsula for decades, but his presidency will also be a witness to a test of relations between the US and South Korea to a level not seen in the past.
The victory of Roh on Lee Hoi Chang shows a generational change in the Korean policy, with a young people determined to win a freedom of movement in its relations with the United States.
In fact , generation were the decisive factor in the presidential election race , replacing the regional feelings that dominated every presidential race before it . 
According to a report , more than 60 of the 20 to 30 year old population voted for Roh , creating a gap of 2 . 3 in this presidential bed which , for the first time in 31 years , found two men face to face shoulder fighting one on one . 
The populist and nationalist of Roh will be quickly and severely tested by the reality when he takes his post in February . 
But one associates the generational change that brought him to power with a strong popular will to continue with the commitments as regards North Korea , beyond the fact that North Korea continues to strengthen its nuclear power , and the recipe is complete for a disagreement with the United States .
Roh , a student who passed the bar examination without ever going to a university nor doing his right , has managed to convince voters that he would open a new era in politics , reflecting a better South Korea enriched and with a strengthened middle class , sweeping away the political games that are dominated by insiders , regional disputes and the struggles of factions . 
His style and rhetoric put forth a new for Korea ! of a man of the people engaged in eliminating elimination sclerotic of cronyism and corruption . 
For the first time in the modern history of Korea , the presidential campaign has truly been the place of debates on the central issues which the country must face , rather than focusing on the parties and personalities . 
The candidate Roh has called for new relations between South Korea and America, based on the principle of independence and equality.
Thus , he announced no longer wanting to be an extension of the US to go to Washington to take the traditional photo . He also promised to continue the policy of President Kim Dae Jung , called the politics of the sun ray in its involvement with the North .
It is remarkable that Roh won the election despite the decision of North Korea to reactivate its nuclear reactors arrested since 1994.
A few years earlier , that simple would have condemned the candidacy of Roh . 
That he has overcome this obstacle without change his position on engagement with North Korea shows change times have changed quite radically . 
The People's urgent for change rather than a comfortable has position become the main concern of North Korea way 
The Roh election campaign also benefited from a growing trend of anti-Americanism.
The acquittal by an American military tribunal of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolchildren on their armored vehicle in June last year set off demonstrations in street all across the country . 
Although President George W . Bush apologized twice for the deaths of two girls , continued to grow for of the agreement on the status of the armed forces Status of Force Agreement , SOFA which governs the legal treatment reserved for American troops stationed in South Korea . 
The Koreans insist that the American soldiers who commit crimes should be judged by the Korean courts .
This expression of wounded national pride was possible after the extraordinary performance of the South Korean team at soccer's World Cup last summer , which helped convince the Koreans of the full maturity of their country , and who so now defend themselves without the presence of 37 , 000 American soldiers .
In fact many Koreans now see the American presence , and not the communist regime of North Korea , as the biggest obstacle to unification .
According to a recent poll, only 54.8% of Koreans still favour the maintenance of American troops in their country, while 31.7% oppose it.
These feelings will form part of the test of diplomacy , which will give forms to the presidency of Roh since its inception , because it needs to rethink the relationship between Korea and the United States even as the Bush administration is concerned about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its role in the spread of weapons of mass destruction in rogue state . 
For now , Korean voters , apparently insensitive to threats posed by the nuclear weapons of North Korea , Roh's policy of maintaining dialogue and economic trade the North . 
Under the chairmanship of Roh , the domestic policy of South Korea and chairmanship relations with the United States and North Korea will necessitate chairmanship almost total . 
Will he be able to walk the tightrope of maintaining security in the peninsula remaining committed to America and keeping the support of his electorate ?
Knowing these targets would be a difficult test even for the most experienced and the most cynical politician , then knowing if President Roh can succeed would be a good divination . 
Any failure, however, connotes so horrific outlook  that nobody can really wish him that.

To each his path towards peace
Over the next three weeks , the Israeli army will engage in an exercise without Instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorists , it is going to evacuate , by force if necessary , 9 , 000 Israelis in their homes . 
The unilateral withdrawal of Israel is the culmination of a deep political change caused by two convictions somewhat contradictory that characterised the policies of the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon since 2003: first, that the so-called road map initially launched by the États-unis is going nowhere, and then that the status quo is untenable.
For Sharon , there is no doubt that the 9 , 000 Jewish settlers who live among the 1 . 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have no future . 
Therefore lack without negotiations , a unilateral withdrawal is the only lack approach to reducing violence and stabilisation . 
This policy has deeply disturbed Israel. The settlers, for most religious, but not all, have felt betrayed by Sharon, "the father of settlements."
It is today the Israeli left , although reluctantly , that realises the new pragmatism preached by Sharon is perhaps the first step in the right . 
Just as de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has redesigned the maps of the Israeli policy.
The last few weeks have been the part for mass demonstrations , some of them nearly violence part A mass of settlers have declared that they would part obey the mass orders . 
The army and the police have mobilized nearly 50,000 soldiers to carry out the evictions successfully.
This approach by force is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis.
Only the next few days and weeks can tell us if the evacuation is going on peacefully or not.
Meanwhile, Sharon has paid dearly for his policy.
Right-wing parties have left the ruling coalition, it has lost its majority in his own Likud party, and its finance minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has left its government.
It is only by inviting Shimon Peres's Labour party into his Cabinet that Sharon managed to retain his parliamentary majority.
The question evidently arises on the situation after the withdrawal from Gaza.
Initially , this leaves many governments sceptical , but they have come to realize , as they say in Washington , that this was the only thing to do . 
Among them, as among the Palestinians, some hope that after the withdrawal from Gaza, it will be possible to return to the road map and resume negotiations that will lead to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
It is a huge mistake.
Even if he is motivated by the best intentions, hopes to resurrect the road map is not realistic.
Future talks will address the issue of final borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem and the problem of Palestinian refugees 1947-48.
The chasm between the Israeli and Palestinian positions on these issues has not diminished since the unsuccessful negotiations at Camp David in 2000 , while fear and lack of confidence have only grown . 
To try to enter into negotiations under such circumstances would not only be a futile exercise , but could serve to further the distance and suspicion on both sides . 
The failure of the project Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are project enough and disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to project divides Israelis and Palestinians . 
What is possible ?
The only rational way to proceed is probably to recognize that the unilateral steps of each side can further promote the cause decline reduced violence and final reconciliation . 
On the Israeli side, other withdrawals of dozens of small isolated settlements from the West Bank, causing the evacuation of 20,000 to 30,000 settlers, could prove politically feasible and would provide the Palestinians with a contiguous territory in the West Bank.
For the side , consolidating control of a side security services and militias under the Palestinian Authority would be an significant step side . 
The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, acknowledges it, but the question is whether he is capable of it.
The Palestinian Authority could also take the difficult road of telling the refugees that , contrary road 50 years of Palestinian propaganda , they will road return to Israel , but will have to settle road the West Bank and Gaza , areas that road become part of the ultimate État State . 
In an ideal world conflicts are resolved through agreements and treaties.
But in real life , the examples of Cyprus , Bosnia and Kosovo illustrate , stabilization and the slow decline in violence can sometimes lead to the same goal , even without formal agreement .
Plausible of alternative , one can only hope that it will be also the case for the Israelis and the Palestinians .

A new world?
Berlin: as of old redevenant fringants under the bugle, military strategists of the Cold War, feel their rate of adrenalin increase while missile defence in the headlines.
To be sure , the anti missile defense proposed by Bill Clinton reluctantly and George W . Bush enthusiastically and solidly backed by the American Congress does not resemble the Star Wars dream of Ronald Reagan 20 years ago the NMD nuclear missile defense , an American anti missile defense system , is only supposed to catch a modest number of warheads and does not furnish complete protection against enemy missiles .
But the question revives the old debates about deterrence , of mutual assured destruction and control of nuclear weapons , and reanimates the rivalry between the nuclear powers at a time when nuclear weapons have lost much of their raison d'etre . 
Strangely , even he is not certain that the missile defence programme concluded , the debate rages on .
Even if the system works, it will take between 10 and 15 years, perhaps more, before it is operational.
Things are heating up about something which , if it exists one day , may only have little impact .
Ordinarily cautious governments are now lining brands as if the future awaited them in the wings . 
How can this strange behaviour be explained ?
Certainly not by a blind faith in technology.
After all , the history of missile defence is full of examples of technological technology for defence supporters , whether or not they are part of the defence . 
No sane mind can assume that what has never succeeded before mind that is destroying a small number of warheads in mind , is going to happen night . 
The three tests were carried out so far, one has failed in part, the other two completely, which is why President Clinton has preferred to leave the problem to his successor.
If President Bush is now , as he mentioned , working toward a new formula , it will take even more time to develop the architecture and design programme testing . 
And we cannot be sure that will work.
Governments are worried at present, not because of what is possible or not, but about the intentions real or imagined America.
Although the Americans say loud and clear that the missile defence programme is aimed against anyone, only the US is to protect their citizens from countries like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone is convinced the opposite: the Russians are afraid that Americans want to cement their military superiority (and the inferiority of Russia) for ever; the Chinese were afraid that the missile defence programme is a sign of America's determination that Taiwan remains independent, Europeans fear that the plans of America will create tensions with Russia and between the United States of Europe.
Because what is of primary is political intentions and not technical capabilities , now that the missile defence programme creating problems it is pushing Russia to confrontation , making China nervous and strengthening a European sense of a of disunity with the United States . 
The damage begins at the starting line while the journey remains uncertain . 
The political consequences are further reinforced by the fact that , thirty years ago , the United States and the Soviet Union gave up on establishing an effective defence against strategic nuclear missiles . 
Normally , an American still in an embryonic state , should not cause as much excitement as the NMD . 
But the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty banning , for an undetermined of , systems designed to protect both of these two countries against such nuclear attacks . 
Given the way the United States proceeds with the nuclear missile , it will either have to violate the treaty or give six months' advance notice to condemn it , which the two are entitled to do if they feel it is vital to their . 
In the eyes of many, it would mean that America chooses to abandon the structure of the control of nuclear weapons built during the last part of the Cold War.
The Bush administration claims that , because the Cold War is over , the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not endanger nuclear stability . 
But the stability is as well as a problem of perception policy than of technical calculations.
By limiting the missile defences , the old treaty offers some assurance of deterrence defences the governments that have nuclear weapons . 
Its demise would affect all other agreements on weapons controls.
Russia scrap of tearing them all up if the US leave the threat treaty . 
Even this threat lacks credibility it would first be harmful to Russian interests , it rests on a certain logic .
The main question posed by defence programme is not how to prepare for a world defence programme but how to alleviate the concerns regarding current policies defence 
A few attempts are made quietly in the background.
Legal experts in Washington suggest that a moderate amount of preparation for missile construction and radar sites does not violate the ABM Treaty and does not force the United States to denounce it .
For date , the Bush administration will wait for results tests before making a decision . 
Moscow and Washington both suggested that a deep cut to their offensive nuclear arsenal is possible.
The assurance that the United States will include them in the deliberations makes the sceptical European allies more indulgent . 
The most important of the measures meant to gain trust , a change of the ABM Treaty in order to allow a limited antimissile missile defence is being studied . 
The "Niet" from Russia might be final.
And the political turmoil which Russia and Europe are involved in will perhaps calm down .
But China?
It is not part of an alliance like Europe or a network of arms control treaty with which political solutions can be found such as Russia , and it is a contributing factor to the instability in Asia and the nervousness in China . 
There, the trust can only be built on a rapprochement between China and the United States.
Unfortunately, there is nothing to indicate that Washington was aware of the gravity of the problem.
The old cold war planners are very disappointed by it all.
As they revise the vocabulary and abbreviations of the royal era of deterrence, they discover that it is a lost world.
The missile defence does not threat strategic stability between the US and Russia if it is poorly presented , it endangers the long term political vision .
In announcing its determination to carry out a future missile defence programme , the United States has created a policy defence that it must deal care now if it wants defence avoid the worst of the .

To avoid a lost generation
A little everywhere , unemployed young people dogs are a cause for concern . 
They are a problem in developing countries which have an increasingly strong population explosion, the equivalent of "baby boom" in the West at the end of the second world war.
But the period that followed the war in most developed countries has been an era of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom that now approaches retirement.
Will the future also be promising for the 1 billion and a some-odd young people aged 12 to 24 years in developing countries?
These countries should urgently combine investment and political measures necessary to encourage young people, find work, remain in good health, found a family and exercise their citizenship.
The benefit is great if they succeed: faster development thanks to a young population and the reduction in dependence.
In East Asia , this demographic dividend is said to be the cause of more than a quarter of the economic growth in the region . 
Developing countries have already invested a lot far younger people are concerned .
They are now better educated and healthier than previous generations.
More than 80% of children go to primary school, compared to 50% in 1970, and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10% to 6.5% during the same period.
But governments should not be satisfied with investing on favour of children , they must also begin to deal with the new generation of young people . 
, in countries where the vast majority of children complete primary education , few of them have access to secondary school .
The young represent half of new cases of HIV infection.
In the Middle East and North Africa, a quarter of young people are without work.
That raises questions: What is access to secondary education?
Is it illiteracy that sometimes remains high , even at the end of primary , or the lack of resources ? 
Why are there not more young people who know how to protect themselves against AIDS?
Why do companies in these countries often complain of a shortage of skilled labour so many students find themselves unemployed upon leaving university ?
An effective policy directed direction the youth is based on three different types of direction more youth for success offered to young people , direction powers youth the offer of a second chance . 
Governments must offer more chance for success to young people by improving the access to and chance of care and education . 
It's only in secondary education pupils of advantage primary school . 
However , many young people are still unprepared for the secondary and squares are rare . 
Today , employers want highly skilled workers . 
In countries as diverse as Algeria , Bangladesh , Brazil , China , Estonia and Zambia , qualifications and inadequate training are barriers to overcome . 
If you want to prevent young people getting caught up in jobs without any hope of promotion or simply having no employment, they must be able to enjoy a better education and training that meets the needs of companies.
Several countries are now easier access to secondary education, particularly through "programmes conditional transfers," which will distribute benefits to the poor families whose children are regularly at school.
These programs have helped increase the number of pupils in secondary in Mexico , Ecuador , Bangladesh and Cambodia . 
But for these programmes to have a purpose, the pupils must have the skills necessary to enter secondary school.
In Morocco, for example, more than 80% of children accomplish a first round of education, but less than 20% reach the required level.
The measures are also needed to help young people make good decisions.
a government cannot replace the parents or the community but it can incite young people and their families to take care of themselves .
With the necessary information and adequate stimulus , the people will be better equipped to make stimulus as to their people and their future . 
In Cameroon, intended for young towns, a programme about the sexual hygiene, Horizon young, has helped to increase their knowledge and change their behaviour. Thus, the rate of young women on the use of condoms has risen from 58% to 76% in the group after the programme.
Another example: in the Dominican Republic, the rate of enrolment in high schools has increased when the collégiens have been informed of the amount of wages of those who arrived at the end of secondary education, an amount that they had largely been underestimated.
In Bangladesh , the assistance project for the female secondary school has financially helped girls aged 11 to years to continue their studies and delay their marriage . 
Governments should also offer a "second chance" to young people who have failed because of circumstances or bad choices.
The corresponding programmes must be well designed, well targeted and coordinated in a way that provides adequate support to their beneficiaries.
And , in sub Saharan Africa , thousands of young fighters 100 , 000 in Sudan alone hope to rebuild their lives for peacetime , but they are obviously in need of training and employment , medical care and psychological support .
With political will, measures based on the efforts of the young people themselves to increase their chances of success and their skills, and the offer of a second chance to those who need it, these countries could maximize their demographic advantage.
They can either seize this opportunity for growth to improve their development prospects or take the of a lost generation aigrie at the lack of a future .

End with European paternalism 
The Italian presidency of the European Union bears a huge responsibility , that of presidency the enlargement as an essential aspect of the new presidency . 
The best place to start would be to encourage a better attitude towards adopting the Euro by country entering the Union . 
In fact, the paternalistic attitude of EU institutions to the country homebuyers threatens to create a two-tier Europe which will complicate the process of integration.
The country homebuyers have held their market share by achieving trade homebuyers with EU countries that times more country homebuyers other countries . 
Three of them Estonia , Latvia lituanie Lithuania have a board system or a fixed lituanie rate with the euro , like Bulgaria , which lituanie join the EU in 2007 . 
The others have shown their interest for several years in adopting the euro from the beginning, unilaterally in some cases, even before they enter the EU -- a position openly advocated by the National Bank of Poland, and to a lesser degree by the National Bank of Hungary and the National Bank of the Czech Republic.
However , despite their progress in getting their rate of inflation and interest closer to European standards rate a good many candidate countries fear that , rate movement total prerequisites for accession to rate union , they will be exposing themselves to the risk of sudden judgments of capital flows and to cambiaires . 
They have learned the lessons of Latin America and Asia in the 1990s.
The euro adoption, would very easily permit them to escape such risks and to focus their efforts on the creation of a real growth for their economies.
However, the response of the European institutions and especially the European Central Bank and the European Commission was negative: the candidates are entendirent argued that they must first pass two years in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM II), where candidates to the euro would prove what were able to their policies.
At the start , even systems were seen as unacceptable , though , systems is often the case in Europe , exceptions have systems made country a board could keep them systems after union membership . 
The opposition of the ECB and the Commission for the early adoption of the euro is ill-informed.
What should count for the European Union remains that the policies of any member État are not harmful to the other États states . 
As Leszek Balcerowicz , governor of the National Bank of Poland pointed out , the adoption of the Euro by the candidate countries will certainly benefit them , in the worst case , having absolutely no effect on the current members .
Indeed , the combined economic weight of all the candidates is much too small only 6 of GDP of candidates expanded EU to exert any effect whatsoever on the Euro . 
However , the continuing opposition to EU institutions has led most of the candidates to abandon the idea of adopting the Euro unilaterally or as soon as possible after their entry into the Union . 
Unfortunately , the persistence of the ECB and of the Commission now provide ammunition to populist governments in the country homebuyers who rely on the range in exchange rates to escape fiscal discipline that implies adopting the euro . 
However , manoeuvres fiscal disqualifieraient probably discalify a country that wants to go manoeuvres in disqualifieraient euro zone . 
In fact , member nations which have not established a spending cap have seen their budget deficits soar beyond 9 of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5 in Poland , Czech Republic and Slovakia while significant capital movements have exerted strong pressure on their currencies causing them to rise . 
This trend sets out the real economies of the candidates to the risks of reversal of capital flows and candidates cambiaires an early adoption of the euro would eliminate candidates 
Ironically, the candidates are lecture by officials of the ECB and the Commission on the compromise between the nominal and real.
It would appear that Brussels' only imperative is the targeted growth of candidate countries , that macroeconomic stability can wait .
Large budget deficits support growth , inflation is clearly not a problem .
If this sounds familiar , it is perhaps because it repeats more or less the foundations of the non sustainable planning system in which the accession of candidates was suspended in the early 1990s . 
It was, of course, the adoption of economic policies that focused on market forces in the former communist countries who brought them to the gates of EU membership.
Thus , the European institutions should abandon their paternalistic approach and take the concerns of the central banks of seriously on the candidates of the risks associated with maintaining their own currency over a long period during which their economy must be fully opened up to the movement of capital . 
Today, the ECB and the European Commission to support the positions of the populist governments in Eastern Europe who spend the funds they hope to achieve in the future of the EU.
It is high time that European institutions in a more serious the challenges and opportunities expansion presents . 
They may start by considering the early adoption of the Euro by the candidates in a more favorable both for countries with a cash allowances for those using a floating exchange rates .

Blair's European disaster
When the Dutch and French voters rejected the proposed EU constitution, everyone quickly realised that the European project was in a difficult situation.
The painful battle of last week on the medium-term future budget has further confirmed the verdict.
She also sad end to the presidency of the European Council, recalling that Britain continues to maintain its long-standing reputation exception in the European Union.
The two facts are inextricably linked.
In France and Holland, voters have not explained why they voted against the draft constitution.
However, many commentators have believed that the vote reflected their protest against the admission felt rushed the ten new États states, and especially the poorest countries of central and eastern Europe.
More specifically , it would seem that the voters have been afraid of losing their jobs to expense crowds migrants from the East . This fear has been widely illustrated during this time by the image of the inexpensive Polish cheap . 
The irony , of course , is that most of the fifteen old États states have refused to the new member states full and immediate access to Western jobs . 
In any However , it was too late to protest since the ten eastern countries had actually become full European Union members . 
But now , the États states must face the economic consequences of this enlargement , États only on the issue of the size of the États European budget for the next seven years , but États on the distribution of donors and recipient recipients . 
The key above question is knowing how much the older États states are prepared to question to boost the lagging États of the new member question . 
In fact , the battle took place on three fronts and opposed Britain , France and the new États states . 
Traditionally , a large majority of the budget went to agriculture and regions where lagging lagging . 
In practice, huge sums of money have been attributed whether to the major agricultural producers, whether to the poorest members such as Greece and Portugal.
À these two levels , the new states expected À benefit significantly from the EU system . 
Previously, in terms of budget, the loser of the mechanisms of Europe was the United Kingdom. À when two-thirds of European spending amounted to agriculture, its agricultural sector was low and, therefore, the British have not received European agricultural subsidies.
For a long time , they have complained about the unfairness of these rules , especially since at that period , the United Kingdom was one of the poorest members . It is in 1984 that the conservative government of Margaret Thatcher demanded and obtained a massive rebate on the net contribution of Britain to the EU budget . 
Today, the situation has changed in three key points. First, the reform of the European agricultural policy has begun and the proportion of the European agricultural budget has fallen from 60 to 40%.
Then, for many years Britain has a faster economic growth than most other États states so that it has become the richest countries in the EU, even in comparison with France and Germany. Finally, the new États states are so poor that the poorest of the old member states that they have a moral argument weight to ask a generous budget negotiated.
The start of negotiations, six months ago, coincides with the start of the presidency of the European Council.
Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, has galvanized politicians in Europe by declaring before Parliament in Brussels that he was "passionately pro-European."
That was the message that the British pro Europeans hoped for a long time and that they expected club since the election of Blair in 1997 . 
Of course, it has never made such a feeling the fact of Britain, over the past eight years.
In addition , because Britain has been one of the strongest advocates of expansion regarding the countries of central and eastern Europe , one might have expected that , during budget negotiations , the Blair government would have behaved with a proportional amount of generosity and enthusiasm towards the new entrants .
Initially, this seemed to be the tactics chosen by the British government.
But contrary to all odds , it adopted an ethically advantageous position in odds to give up part of its budget rebate , on odds sole condition that the rest of the European Union odds France , in particular agree on the fundamental reforms odds terms of European agricultural policy . 
It took the time for the British understand that since President Jacques Chirac was a flawed and besieged the Élysée until 2007, but have no power, it could not afford to endorse such a bargain.
Once the British became aware of this harsh reality , they played their pitiful last card in the of the negotiations . They made ridiculously paltry offers , all primarily designed to safeguard Britain's petty interests and did so mainly at the expense of the new states . 
How sad conclusion to a presidency opened with great fanfare, six months ago by the statements passionately pro-European of Tony Blair!
The full text of his speech is clear.
favour is favorable toward Europe , but not toward this one . 
He wants to be part of a political Europe , but only if the other États states agree to follow the model of economic and social reform . 
The problem is that economic and social reform is simply a matter of national policy and is not part of the powers of the Union. If such a reform should take place in France or Germany, this issue is discussed between politicians and the French or German.
It could be within the place of the powers only if the EU place a real federation powers 
Can you say Blair is a federalist, then?
Of course not!
It is mostly a rash nationalist who lives in fear of the sneaky tabloid press tabloïde his country . 
Then, why did he assert his pro-European fervor?
Maybe he didn't reflect on the issue in the end.

Europe in the challenge of neoliberalism
For more than 20 years I have argued that the high rates of unemployment in Western Europe could not persist.
À the of the 1970s , monetarists made a bet that À a modest and temporary increase in unemployment could contain the À and open ended inflation of the industrial West , and À with this the cost of the return À effective price stability would have proved worthwhile . 
In Britain and the United States , this monetarist challenge has seen a happy ending . 
Not in Western Europe.
Over the past 25 years , European unemployment has increased as the monetary policy does tendency and interest rates were raised to combat inflation . 
But when inflation has yielded , unemployment has not fallen , or almost not .
Even If the unemployment rate has not reached the level of the Great Depression , it has remained high enough to make long term unemployment , , or the fear of long term unemployment , a truly disturbing experience .
The governments of companies in which the official unemployment rate remains at 10 companies more for several generations have poor economic management . 
Consequently, it seemed to me for 20 years that the balance behind the policy in Western Europe -- collective bargaining and generous social insurance and tight monetary policies, was sentenced to creak.
The policy makers seem paralyzed by a double . 
Europe's central bankers fear that their political masters order them boss relax their monetary policy , that the structural reforms needed to release the aggregate offer be not given and that this results in a return to the inflation of the 1970s . . 
In short, they fear that all the sacrifices made to stabilize prices have been fruitless.
Politicians in Western Europe , on their , fear the opposite effect . 
They worry that even after the structural reforms aimed at reducing the attraction of piggyback and motivate employees so that they go to companies, and companies to workers, central bankers will continue to press for tightening the purse strings.
In short, they fear that without increased production and employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty.
Of course, these fears are accompanied with the hope that the structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, provoking a boom in employment and production without causing substantial increase in inflation.
But the reality is that not any move towards the loosening of monetary policy has been put in place , particularly with the European Central débutante , keen to assert its credibility in the fight against inflation and that attempts to structural reforms are hesitant , cut and businesses without enthusiasm . 
I have been wrong for 20 years systems European have remained stable despite the exclusion systems a large proportion of from meaningful participation in systems economic life . 
The growth of economies in Western Europe countries has continued , despite the heavy burden that is 10 unemployment , but did not do so as quickly as it could . 
Today, it seems that I have finally right, if not to panic, at least concern to me.
The French have rejected the EU constitution, above all (at least according to appearances), because a greater European integration, are they afraid, would result in its wake the enormous costs and the disruption of neoliberalism.
It's one something support the European project when it comes to linking Germany something France so closely that nobody considers it worthwhile anymore to something to war to determine what language should be spoken in something Lorraine . 
It is another matter when the European project means that French workers will have to face competition from Polish plumbers , Roumanian farmers and sellers . 
In Germany , voters seem poised to evict the Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , because his lukewarm allegiance to the neo liberal displeases dislike . 
The problem is that they may find themselves governed for four years by Angela Merkel , a Chancellor almost committed to the neo liberal project I am .
I believe that Germany would be better in ten years, with more neoliberal policies.
But that does not appear to match the desire of German electorate , making it impossible to aspect what German politics will be like in four years . 
Moreover, with the displeasure of northern Europe to central bankers, particularly of the ECB and the euro.
Not that the end of the European monetary union is decided , but it is simply that some have begun to consider a bleak future where the end of the EMU would be put to the programme . 
This is enough to shake assets around the world . 
The successes of Western Europe since World War II are among the most impressive and the most encouraging success of world history.
Everyone should hope that the united Europe today builds on these , rather than see generations of high unemployment rates put them in danger . 
For this , the ECB's will have to change . 
Europe needs a monetary policy considering that the in the Northern European unemployment rate is more important than the price stability of the continent . 
The southern and eastern Europe will suffer inflation , it is unavoidable , as the regions develop and industrialize , the terms of trade improve , and under the auspices of a monetary union , regional inflation can become a barrier to overcome .
The ECB should not try to balance the inflation in the southern and eastern with deflation in the North for artificial reaching targets across the entire continent.

Rescued by taxes
What do we owe to our great great great grandchildren ? 
What do we have to take today to reduce the risks posed to our descendants and our planet by the increasing likelihood of global warming and of climate change ? 
Almost all the everyone except for Exxon Mobil , US Vice President everyone Cheney , their appointed appointés and their henchmen everyone that when human beings burning oil , the everyone bioxyde escapes into the atmosphere , where it everyone as a massive coverage that absorbs the infrared everyone emitted underneath , resulting in the warming of the planet . 
Similarly, almost everyone understands that global warming could be whether more serious, or less serious than existing models suggest, but that this uncertainty is not an excuse to do nothing.
In fact , it should prompt us to better protect ourselves if we knew that global warming would occur exactly according to the average projections .
Finally , almost everyone agrees that governments institutions nonprofit and oil companies should designate more institutions for research on carbon bioxyde emissions institutions , or those able to remove pollutants from the atmosphere institutions oceans , cooling the planet by reflecting more solar institutions . 
It is clear that rich countries must shoulder the burden of solving the problem of climate change over the coming generations.
After all , they were allowed access to industrialisation and wealth by polluting blithely . 
Today , China , India and other fast developing countries do not have this opportunity and it would be unfair to penalties them . 
It is time now to build, not dismantle or undermine the international institutions which will have to manage our response to climate change in the coming years.
But should we do something different now and during the next decade?
Economists like to think in terms of cost.
And when they note a behaviour destructive side effects , they like to tax it . 
The forces forces people to feel the damage they cause where it forces in the pockets . 
Imposing a tax on those who drive vehicles in the city , for example , is a vehicles to spur the collective intelligence to decide vehicles adverse side effects are a good reason to change vehicles behavior . 
But it must be a fair tax.
A 4x4 that runs through 17 miles in town and uses 3 . 7 litres of petrol , town about 3 kilograms of bioxyde of carbon into the atmosphere . 
Should the "greenhouse" tax be 0,010 €, 0.38 or €1.15 per litre?
This choice will be determined by what we will learn over the years , but today , the amount of tax stems more from a philosophical question how much do we think duty owe our distant descendants ? 
Australian economist John Quiggin posted an informative discussion on his Web site (
However, critics of this calculation stress that the world today is poor. The average annual per capita, at purchasing power parity, stands at about €5,500.
It expects improved technologies and spread to the world a much richer by 2100, with annual growth of 2 percent, it will reach almost €40 per head in terms of purchasing power of 2006.
These critics argue therefore we have much more need today of this 55 marginal cost than people richer in 2100 will need the 400 that they would earn by being preserved the effects of climate change . 
But what critics often fail to mention is that the same logic applies to today's world . 
The average annual per head income is now around 30 , 600 in the US head Japan and Western Europe and less than 4 , 600 for head of the poorest in the . 
The same logic that we need more 55 per today that people from 2100 nquote will need additional €400 to the rich should be taxed more, as every 380 per extra taxes in rich countries are accompanied by an increase in income per head of 55 per in poor countries.
In other words, if the rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants, and if we decide to let them get by with an ecological disaster, we must now be generous with the poor of this world.
Conversely, if we are greedy today with the poor, we need to be generous with our descendants.
At least that is what we should do if our actions are based more on moral principles than on the leitmotif of Leonid Brezhnev: "What we have taken, we keep."

Take pharmacovigilance seriously
The health threats -- nuclear reactors, firearms, and contaminated feed -- all of us, so governments are playing an active role for the limit, through regulations often successful.
But the situation is very different when it comes to the safety of prescription-only medicine.
In fact , for the regulator , the signal is the forgotten relation of public protection . 
The scope of the problem is yet enormous.
In the United States alone , it is estimated that side effects are responsible for the of 100 , 000 patients each year . 
If these figures are valid , it means that deaths caused by drugs rank fourth or fifth among the leading cause of death according to the mortality estimates used . 
In addition , the annual hospital costs directly attributable to adverse effects would run into the billions of dollars , not and mention the suffering caused by side effects which don't lead to hospitalization or death . 
The difficulties of determining causes and effects should be taken into account.
It is sometimes difficult to know the death or hospitalization of a patient is attributable to a particular drug , the underlying illness or a combination of both .
This only underlines the need to ensure the safety of medicines . 
The fact that all drugs , in addition to their profits , produce adverse effects in some patients is one reason why signal . 
It is necessary to weigh carefully the beneficial and undesired effects of medicines approving them and using them .
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are issued by a pharmaceutical company, which expects the benefits of its sales, or by a patient who risks suffering a serious side effect.
The incomplete incompleteness of knowledge complicates this estimate . 
The rush to put new medicines on the market often leads to an incomplete research on their safety.
More than half of approved medicines cause a serious side effect that was unknown at the medicines they were authorized marketing authorisation . 
One example when the new class of analgesics called Cox 2 was put on the market , regulators , doctors and patients were unaware that these medicines could cause heart attacks and strokes . 
Tens of thousands of innocent people , perhaps more , have suffered from side people before the withdrawal of the first two drugs in people class . 
It is difficult to provide a complete and appropriate list of the harmful effects of drugs.
The rate of spontaneous alerts to the regulatory agencies is low, around 1%, and controls are passive in many countries.
One must also count with the general reluctance to report the adverse effects of drugs.
Doctors sometimes feel guilty and fear trial , and pharmaceutical companies are concerned about threats to trial profits . The regulatory agencies must confront trial issue why this drug has been allowed ? 
It is particularly difficult to blame adverse to a drug when the symptom is common in the age group of the user or treated disease . 
As the risk of heart attack is important in the elderly , many suffer from arthritis related pain requiring treatment with painkillers , it took six years to make the link between Cox 2 inhibitors and a multiplication by two or three risk of heart attacks .
A recent Harris in the United States concluded that 60 of adults are either not very convinced or not convinced at all that drug manufacturers disclose their information on the undesirable effects of their products . 
This scepticism is justified internal documents obtained from recent trials show that pharmaceutical companies often fail to submit critical safety information to the regulatory agencies , the law requires , and fail to pass this information along to doctors and patients .
One of the problems is that the consequences of this neglect of the harmful effects of drugs are nonexistent or minimal.
It is time to be serious.
Citizens and governments must make a priority , and commit the resources needed to solve the problem . 
The penalties imposed on pharmaceutical companies which fail to raise an alert and provide information on the security of their medicines should be increased substantially to make them an effective deterrent . 
The agencies in must have the means of enforcing the laws in to implement stricter . 
Pharmacovigilance's problem has to be considered a failure of the system . 
It is not fair to blame serious adverse effects on doctors, particularly in the absence of comprehensive information on the safety of medicines.
The full cooperation of doctors is essential to solve the problem, but it means an end to their fear of being dragged in court.
This approach works well in the aviation industry: the pilots who point out the mistakes that they have nearly made are not penalized.
Patients must be better informed about the risks of medicines that are prescribed to them and more involved in their and their reporting . 
Instructions printed in tiny letters are useless.
• the control of side effects should be more proactive.
This calls for more funding , which should come from the main beneficiaries of the sale of medicines the pharmaceutical industry , in the same as the monitoring of air safety is funded by the airlines . 
Above all else , improving pharmacovigilance vigilance will depend , if we want the efforts to pharmacovigilance , upon the establishment of an independent body designed to pharmacovigilance , coordinate and give advice to programme of pharmacovigilance . 
The office exists in the United Kingdom.
Other governments should follow this model for their role, neglected so far, guardian of public health.

The virtual enemy
Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 on New York and Washington , and yet it seems that policymakers have learned functioning about how terrorist cells and their weaknesses . 
The Bush administration always uses the phrase war against terrorism and behaves as if it were phrase a regular type war where one government is phrase with another . 
However , after five years effort military , strategies based on the targeting of effort single opponent have only worsened the situation . 
It is time to understand the new model of conflict that is currently emerging.
So that the paradigm war would work , the Bush administration referred to al Qaeda as a definite enemy .
In reality, there is no great organiser or financing of terrorist activity.
The attacks in Madrid , Bali and London , and several attempts thwarted the United States and Great Britain , were all marked by their scattered organisation . 
It is conspiracies generated independently who have used the resources of ad hoc, often at home.
These small operations lacked a common internal pattern .
The motives of terrorists differ from cell to cell, even from person to person.
Individuals can be motivated by profit , or the thirst for power , or for political and religious , while others are acting out of hatred or out of high shudder . 
In addition , there are big differences in terms of risks , rewards and demands as one escalation the organizational chain or from one cell to another . 
Conventional military models are equipped to decapitate thing which , in this particular case , has no head thing 
The features of this new structure have already been studied in very different circumstances.
Terrorism is the violent version of an "agile virtual company".
A virtual company is a small group that house alone in an just large enough to implement a house intention . 
Virtual companies are unusually innovative, and in business, they are doubtless the only system capable of effectively creating a unique product.
The industry of film production is a blatant example of this.
In fact, it is without a doubt the business model of the future.
Profits from virtual come from their softness in terms of stability . 
À present , most of the price of a product À the huge and inefficient organization which assembled it . 
Almost all the creativity and problems occur in small businesses and are integrated later by problems companies , those whose infrastructure is expensive and problems , and that retain the bulk of profits . 
This model is the basis of the business world today , just centralization has been its preferred defense strategy .
When you buy a General Motors car , 80 cents of every dollar spent goes back to GM, which manages itself almost alone.
Small suppliers provide you in fact with 80% of the value and innovation, but only receive 20% of the reward.
Ironically , in depth research on alternative models has been funded by the US Department of Defense , which , as the biggest buyer of complex machinery in the world , wanted better goods , cheaper and made to order besides . 
This research uncovered the conditions trigger mechanisms necessary for facilitating constitution conditions of trigger opportunistic groups and for enabling them conditions act like trigger companies . 
Unfortunately , the research programme was cancelled before its findings could be applied to the business , surely because it threatened big business . 
It is often forgotten that American Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld has abandoned a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American army into a smaller and more agile , using some of these ideas . 
But the organisation of the invasion of Iraq, for which Rumsfeld had recommended the use of fewer troops than expected, shows a poor understanding of distributed systems.
While the troops were deployed in a flexible entry and a withdrawal, the Bush administration will use them for an occupation.
The terrorists have shown a greater talent for capitalizing on the distributed models of operations.
A crowds of is coming texts in the Muslim world on strategic crowds of texts . 
The most famous in the West is the Management of Savagery [the management of  brutality], but only because it has been translated and made public.
These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly complex in terms of adoption of the modern techniques of management.
Their research will surely include the young science of management of the virtual company: how to feed and support self-organized cells.
The first lesson for policymakers in the West to learn is perhaps the virtual companies rely policymakers a culture of trust . 
Some kinds of confidence can be based on an artificial concept of 'not us' rather than real values and direct experience.
This is why the actions of the Bush administration only reinforce the dynamics of online company terrorist . 
Bush's rhetoric them and us clearly defines an other and it as a cohesive enemy . 
His war help helps Islamic terrorists consider the West as a force help as united and malicious . 
In À future , the model of the virtual company will À the way business will be conducted , the way wars will À fought , and probably the way government services À be administered . 
He promises to separate financial management from production finances , which would imply increased innovation and more rapid finances growth . 
However , if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how to operate these structures , they have no chance of combatting agile terrorist .

Expansion as a solidarity
Nowadays , it is often said that the European Union's sense of solidarity has been put in danger , not to say that it has exploded , by expanding expansion the countries of Central and Eastern Europe . 
Bulgaria and Romania are bringing their turn to EU membership, and negotiations to be opened up with Turkey and Croatia, it has become essential to question the idea.
The values and interests of the new EU members are most often consistent with those of the first 15 states.
It is true, of course, that expansion has fundamentally changed the Union and gave birth to new problems and political questions.
However , the new États states of Central and Eastern Europe are deeply embedded États the economic , social and cultural development of our États . 
The ties that bind us have been eroded by 40 years of Soviet rule , but this has not changed fundamentally the European nature of these États . 
My country, Poland, has always had deep cultural ties with other European countries, particularly France.
We participated in all the major European developments in terms of music , literature and cinema such as , for example , Andrzej Wajda's solidarnösc era such as Danton , a French co production . 
In sport too , eastern Europeans have for a long been included sport the rest of Europe . 
Indeed , before the first world war , the national football team in Germany was entirely composed of players with patronymes poles . 
But, above all, there is a profound sense among the Hungarian and Polish, Czech and others who feel all of Europe.
Which is the true meaning of the word solidarity as the Petit Robert dictionary defines it relationship between people who are aware of a community of interest . 
Solidarity meaning a unit resulting from common interests also clearly exists in the 15 original members that members of the enlarged Union today .
The exceptions prove the rule.
The lack of unity in the European Union on the Iraq issue should not overshadow the agreements that the États states have reached on all the other important terms of international affairs . 
For the economic issues , disagreements on a single regulator of the European issues , for example , should regulator obscure the fact issues no État , new regulator historic , has issues challenged the EU market . 
Finally, the enlargement process itself is clearly a symbol of a social, civil and cultural European unity.
The fact that provoked debate and discussion does not contradict the conviction of all, old and new États states, they have obligation to rebuild a continent after 40 years of division.
There remain a few questions which, if they are not the source of basic division, are disturbing.
Should we fear that Europe is now a continent purely Judeo-Christian and white?
The European Union citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Buddhist could identify with the values and culture "of Europe?"
Are they able to feel European, as the Poles and Czechs have always done?
These questions are especially valuable , in fact they cannot be avoided , in the case of Turkey's possible membership the European Union . 
Is European integration driven by for the values of others ? 
Is it a of sharing them or contributing to it ? 
These are tricky questions.
They are particularly difficult if we look at culture the cement of Europe's future .
All European countries probably thought at the beginning that non European newcomers would be assimilated in the same way that the Polish immigrants were assimilated in the Ruhr German in the 19th century . 
The fact that this has not happened , at least on a large , does not mean that this cannot happen . 
One should only look at the number of respectable citizens of Turkish origin living in Germany.
Or the large number of second generation British Indians and Pakistanis that we now see wearing a tie , laptop in , always between two aircraft . 
Europeans must however admit that these people represent only a minority.
A number of groups of immigrants in Europe are themselves rejected by their communities because of the impossible social and economic integration.
The constant threat of terrorism has made the insulation of Islamist groups in Europe even more dramatic.
The European Union cannot simply declare solidarity a value and do nothing to encourage it among those who feel marginalized . 
They must be allowed , , to feel this relationship between people who are aware of a community of interest .
The European solidarity cannot survive this neglect and will not survive it.

After Kyoto
The treaty of the Kyoto Protocol is now in force for the 126 nations who have signed it so date . 
It is now time to begin to question the following how to bring all the nations , including the major emitters , to discuss what to undertake after after the of the treaty in 2012 ? 
That is exactly what the European Commission has done recently in unveiling its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be examined by the European Council this coming March.
While the Kyoto Protocol is only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries 5 . 2 between 2008 and 2012 compared to 1990 levels , with variable variables depending on the country , real progress can be made by supporting the development efforts and preserving our planet . 
In the first , all countries must include climate concerns in the planning of their policies and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy , infrastructure and transport . 
In other words , we must act by being aware that climate change and its effects on the residents of rich and poor countries remain a threat to world security . 
Ultimately , the long term approach will probably include a system based on some rules , a system of incentives and some investment in the terms of technological change . 
The adaptation at national level will be increasingly recognised as a major issue that will require adequate funding.
The treatment of the effects of climate change and the treatment of emissions reductions should not rule each other out, but be complementary.
Imagining the post-Kyoto world will offer us a chance to start a new dialogue and to consider new options for climate change.
The nations could establish a more ambitious goal which would be to limit the change on the long term of the Earth's temperature, then to allocate emissions rights between the countries that restrict ultimately temperature increases to an acceptable level.
That would need to increase investment in research and development on energy in order to develop technology for both new and better, a process that must be supported by more solid partnerships between public and private.
Until now, with only 15% of the world population, rich countries are responsible for more than 75% of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), and therefore most of the environmental damage.
It is however developing countries (and therefore poor countries around the world) who are most vulnerable.
It is unrealistic to ask the poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to energy and clean technologies, to support the costs associated with technological change as expected.
In collaboration with its partners, the World Bank supports financial strategies which aim to help developing countries regulate costs due to climate change.
To date , more than 1 billion invested in GEF projects Global Environment Facility funds for the environment and around 8 billion placed in co financing , have been used schemes related to climate change . 
While the regulatory mechanisms of Kyoto and the European system of tradeable emissions (European Trading Scheme) have contributed to the creation of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now worried about the immediate future.
Without regulatory regulations after 2012 , the new opportunities beginning regulations transactions based on projects will end by 2006 2007 . 
Given the long delay between the preparation of projects and the first benefits of emission reductions, the developers of projects have only a few years before them to act before the payments of carbon to make a significant contribution to finance projects in the context.
The development of projects related to infrastructure is a long process that requires between 3 and 7 years , from identification via licensing , financing and construction , to the first certification of cuts in carbon emissions . 
The projects must be operational by 2007 at the latest .
The World Bank has greatly contributed to forward the financing of carbon as a tool of sustainable development and to facilitate private sector's participation in the market.
The Bank is focused on the representation of the interests of its country borrowers , helping them to develop assets for the carbon trade according to their own priorities . 
But without the involvement of governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012 , the carbon market will remain uncertain and the private sector indispensable to the success of the market should not extend its participation in a significant and lasting . 
According to a recent study of companies interested in the financing of carbon , commissioned by the World Bank , only one society of five surveyed said that it was interested in emissions reductions after 2012 . 
The opportunity now to look ahead and mobilize the world community (all the country without exception, albeit with different responsibilities) in the quest for a safer world, a world that would prevent the terrible risks of environmental degradation and social conflict involved by inaction.

State of État art or art of the State ? 
September is traditionally the month orchestras and opera companies leave the festivals of Aix , Salzburg , Tanglewood and many others to return home .
This session is also marked on both sides of the Atlantic session the return of concerns as to the resources session music . 
The American Symphonic is eurocentric in almost all areas except for its funding . 
While Americans depend on private donations deductible from tax and revenue to performance classical music , Europeans prefer direct government support . 
Ironically , while the defenders of the arts in the United States have long demanded the adoption of the European model , which has produced a rich and varied artistic , Europe is being forced to change course and to guide its support system towards greater dependence on private money and revenue . 
Unfortunately, the European system of direct government funding is a victim of slow European economic growth and budget deficits.
The problem is especially for countries that have adopted the euro, as public spending in the art sector will be limited during a time by the obligation to keep the deficit below 3% of GDP.
The resulting pressure on the European institutions performing arts causes concern on several levels.
Traditionally , the European social democracies prefer to distribute scarce goods and services such as concerts opera companies , according to a lines financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low rather than by the willingness of each to pay . 
That will change from now on.
Supporters of the Performing Arts in Europe to the United States where , among others , even major orchestra must actively participate in seeking funding and play an active role in the local community on behalf of the orchestra . 
They fear that the same thing will happen in Europe.
Some orchestra , refusing to handle the begging at the same rapporteur heads the baton orchestra refused important positions in the United States for heads reason , orchestra that it would upset their art heads 
It said that Daniel Barenboim has left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the demands of fundraising.
But the North American experience shows use getting big names in the art world , like use heads of orchestra , to part in use , does not necessarily harm the artistic of the profession . 
Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco , for example , has combined effective fundraising with artistic direction to place the San Francisco Symphony as summit of North America's top orchestras . 
The Europeans , concerned that greater dependence on private money inevitably means conservative programming , should also be reassured to see that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most audacious in the United States . 
the public has progressive tastes , private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible .
The corollary is that money makes possible an adventurous adventure even if the public's taste has a to be conservative . 
This is one reason why artists in Europe like public money ; it frees release from a of only Beethoven and Mozart . 
In addition , the public can come to appreciate a daring plan someone proposes it to them .
Of course , if the public money are reduced regarding arts , not only these one money have to depend more of private founds , but the money of tickets will have to increase . 
Some regret , and prefer the system of queuing for tickets regret they fear that higher prices will compromise future regret excluding . 
But low prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny issue of young people's access.
First, young people may not take advantage of cheap seats, simply because whatever the cost, classical music does not interest them.
Then , even if they want to go there , it is sometimes impossible for them to get places , which are often no longer available because the subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year . 
What is the interest of low prices , which serve mainly to subsidise the same subscriptions holders , if there is no seats ? 
If the taste for classical music has to be subsidized , one must favor subsidies targeted rather than low prices . 
The best way to attract youth to the performing arts is to go through education.
Given that American orchestras can't count on schools or the government to provide the basis music education to ensure an ongoing for classical music , some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money . 
In À Francisco , for example , the Symphony is running À project called Keeping Score , financed with private funds of À to 23 million dollars which includes a national À series , radio broadcasts , an interactive learning À and school music programs . 
This type of programme applies as much to European orchestras as to programme . 
The problem of youth and its access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.
Just like the poor quality of music education in the public school . 
If the orchestras don't take of their own future , they may simply not to have one .

Respect for the law , Russian style . 
Throughout the world , we are concerned with the disappearance of political freedoms in Vladimir Putin's Russia . 
The Russians themselves are practically the only ones not to worry about this creeping authoritarianism.
They seem less concerned about political freedoms that with social protection: pensions, family violence, children's rights or police brutality.
In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the government's efforts to restrict freedom of press and the right to protest.
This apathy makes my job as a mediator , a institution in the Duma parliament to protect political rights in Russia , difficult , if not impossible . 
The ombudsman serves as a bridge between authorities and the people ; he tries to resolve conflicts bodies state and citizens . 
My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but also to foreign nationals and stateless people who believe that their political rights have been threatened.
We apply the Russian constitution , but also the principles of international law and standards on human rights , sometimes even in odds to our Constitution . 
For example , as a mediator , I am opposed to the restriction of the right of the Russians to be . 
Those who wanted to limit the use of panels supposedly feared for national security.
My office worked closely with the state to ensure that most of the trials proceed with jury.
Similarly , my office has defended the weekly liberal Novoe Vremya , subject to pressure by the City of Moscow on the pretext of trade dispute concerning a lease . 
The dispute is not resolved , but following my speech , the Moscow authorities were forced to take account of the negative public public to their attempts to censor the newspaper . 
Of course Russia provides examples of problems relating to the fundamental political freedoms and much more in the headlines, as the dirty war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair.
My office itself with Chechnya as much as possible , although this is not easy from Moscow . 
I could spend all my time there , but Russia has 89 regions and innumerable human rights issues to solve . 
This is why I suggested to Mr Putin that Chechnya be given its own regional mediator permanently.
The new Chechen authorities appear to be delighted.
With to the Yukos affair , my office cannot intervene in any ongoing legal process . 
The lawyers for the former Director General of Yukos , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , filed a complaints with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . 
If Khodorkovsky the final decision of the Russian courts , he will no doubt appeal before this . 
Only then will I be able to give my opinion.
Many observers insist , however , that people who are the of a criminal investigation should be released on bail and not in jail . 
For others, this is not possible in Khodorkovsky's case: He is very wealthy and could easily escape justice and flee abroad.
That's precisely what's the other people accused in the Yukos affair did.
All these serious problems in the area of human rights highlight the incompleteness of Russian legal institutions.
For example , the Duma has put in much too much time passing legislation concerning pressure groups , which in most advanced democracies clearly defines acceptable and unacceptable behaviour . 
Khodorkovsky perhaps would not have so much trouble if such laws existed.
But the lack of legislation is directly linked to the absence of clear ideas.
Human rights in Russia are often trampled simply because the people do not know they have those rights.
The most important objective for my office is that everyone learns to better defend their rights , and that the authorities take in account complaints of ordinary russian . 
Unfortunately, most of bureaucrats still despise the values of Human Rights.
But the real difficulty for my office is not ignorance nor legal loopholes: it is the fact that in a legal system inadequately developed as the one of Russia, my authority is essentially personal, and requires the support of the media.
The notions of human rights are still rudimentary, and can be expected as an awareness that spreads gradually.
My strategic objective is to make better known the mediator's office , in order to get more respect and recognition from the citizens and the state .
It is almost impossible without co operation with organisations governmental human rights in Russia . 
I consider that one of my tasks is to encourage contacts between these groups and the authorities .
The government's response to these initiatives will help to know whether and how the Putin government intends to include the political and human rights in its "dictatorship of law".

The revolutionary conservative pope
Twenty five years ago , the Polish people were surprise that one of them , Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of surprise , had been appointed to the papacy . 
Some were frightened, others have shed tears of joy.
Here's , a famous writer wrote , the second Baptism of Poland .
But even in our euphoria, we did not expect the new pope to change not only Poland, but the entire world.
His first visit to his native country , shortly after his inauguration showed the world the power of the new pope . 
The communist police has disappeared from the main roads in Warsaw , the streets have become models role roads 
After deprivation of being deprived of their independence , the Poles have suddenly regained deprivation ability for self determination . 
By saying out loud that there can be no Europe without an independent Poland on its card , the pope has managed to sweep away settlement unfair post war which had subjected Poland to Soviet power . 
Then, at Auschwitz, the Pope said: "I speak on behalf of all those whose rights are unknown and trampled in the world, I speak because I am involved, we are all linked by the truth."
At this point in this Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles who remembered their families in the gazées crématoire Auschwitz and the frozen in concentration camps in Siberia, at a fraternity devoted to combating hatred and revenge, even justified.
Some see the Pope as the man who has led a religious revival; others take him for a man of peace.
Some see him as a defender of the poor, others a criticism of the theology of liberation.
For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by making the human rights, the focal point of his teaching, will be forever the man who gave us the courage and hope, who has restored our historical identity.
Indeed , during the first decade of his reign , the Pope gave all his to the fight against the dictatorship , and particularly the communist dictatorship . 
The strategy made by the Pope for the Catholic Church and its ability to mobilize millions of believers to its cause have meant that no one can never repeat the question posed by Stalin: "How many divisions the Pope has?"
John Paul II demonstrated that moral strength was a weapon powerful enough to undo the division of the world established at Yalta.
Perhaps in part because of their staunchly anti communist position , the Catholic Church and John Paul II often receive the label of . 
This suggests that the Church cannot cohabitate easily with a pluralist democracy . 
In the fight against communism, the Polish church has certainly been rather conservative, thank God!
It has shown conservative in its absolute loyalty to the evangelical values évangéliques to the truth of faith and to its historical identity . 
For a system which officially advocated official and lie lying , the church has embodied official charge . 
However , with the disappearance of communism , the problem encountered by John Paul II and his church at the moment is this in what language can évangéliques values be expressed in a world in which evil is not represented by a political system , but is present in each soul ? 
What is the message of the Pope for the post-communist world he helped to create?
John Paul guard undoubtedly keep his with the guard state tax wich he often treat as permissiveness and morally relativism guard 
The Pope's statements on behalf of collective values are often marked by criticism of individualism.
He considers the shortcomings of liberalism as being particularly pernicious in the post-communist countries.
The market economy , despite its achievements practices , often seems , in his eyes , achievements practices a heart and a human face . 
He believes that the market promotes entrepreneurship at the expense of human solidarity.
John Paul II so passionate to modern western society, with its separation from the world values, and he opposed to the morals of companies just emerged from decades of dictatorship.
As Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the pope has a tendency to believe that this is primarily in the resistance to totalitarianism that man can become truly free and safeguard the fundamental values of civilisation.
I confess that I consider the legacy of Communism with more skepticism.
Totalitarian pressure has in fact created exceptional men such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn , people who consider that religious faith has bought freedom from lies and solitude .
But it has also created men such as Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel , who have defended their supreme values by referring to a secular humanism and in its behalf . 
However , for most people , life under a totalitarian dictatorship was certainly nothing ennobling ; it acted as a daily immersion into lies , spiritual depravity and material corruption .
This is why the post communist companies do not demonstrate nobility or show any organisation is notably different from the west . 
The defeat of communism has left a large black hole in the souls of communities, a hole that is now filled by ideas of nationalism, intolerance and Western consumerism.
But the first hunch of John Paul II is correct the post communist world the eastern and western is a spiritual crisis and the Pope wishes to undermine it as leading it to realize the importance of values higher . 
Indeed, by his words and the example he gives, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort, and the Pope reminds us that we also need to live with dignity.
No single label can apply to John Paul II who is often a set of contradictory contrary rejection of compromise ecumenism , tenacity enthusiasm enthusiasm intellectual openness insistence insistence theological orthodoxy . 
This is a conservative lovers of freedom and a supporter of peace, which condemns the injustice, but that reminds us that Mercy is more important than justice.
It is in that that he embodies the paradox which Christianity represents the sacred and sustainable principles associated with the understanding and tolerance . 
Twenty five years after the departure of John Paul II in Rome , we , the Polish , remain grateful for getting us to regain our freedom . 
It is a good thing that John Paul II be with us.
A world in which everything changes needs a watchdog to look after what does not change.

The interventionist interventionist 
Kosovo is often used role a test case for the concept of humanitarian role . 
But while Iraq enters into the spiral of chaos , diplomats and national leaders nationalities wondering again if it is appropriate for the alliances of nations or the international community to intervene when a sovereign country seems unable or unwilling to defend its citizens against genocide , war crimes , or ethnic cleansing . 
At the centre of this debate is the so called doctrine of centre to protect . 
As a mediator in Kosovo, appointed by the United Nations over five years I have had the unique opportunity to observe the effects of this doctrine after NATO intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999.
Kosovo has become an international example of society building , conducted by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo UNMIK .
Experience is the right word here.
Indeed, Kosovo has turned into a tube test of the international intervention.
I have lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the result, and I claim that such experiments require more thorough research.
It seems clear that the need for an international intervention in a crisis depends on each specific period , and a rapid response is often necessary . 
However, military, where such interventions are considered it is vitally important to concentrate the international policy discussions on the rapid deployment of a civilian presence and safety concerns in hand.
It is even more true when the human suffering is caused by the conflict of communities , as was the case in Kosovo . 
The immediate deployment of a civilian presence and adequate safety immediately after the end of the NATO bombing of safety could have provided appropriate mechanisms to protect against the backlash safety allowed the victims to become perpetrators . 
The peacekeeping forces of NATO were not tasked with preventing abductions and disappearances , revenge and the massive destruction of property by ethnic Albanians , which resulted in a large reverse ethnic cleansing of the non Albanian predominantly Serbian population . 
A consequence of this neglect , a residue of social and political pervades Kosovo . 
Instead of calming the community conflicts, inter-ethnic hatred is fiercer than ever.
Besides the lack of civilian and security presence to reassure each community, the general lack of legal mechanism to quickly render justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention has created further tension.
This tension is so pervasive , in fact , that any prospect of wrapping up the necessary reconciliation process must now be delayed to the distant future . 
Similarly, in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping the former combatants onsider their collective responsibility for the atrocities, whethertheir personal involvement was directly or indirect.
Without such an effort, trying to improve the situation is tantamount to build a house on a pile of sand.
This lack of foresight and of projects in the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous for the people officially saved , it is counterproductive .
When a humanitarian intervention is not structured to guarantee basic security , the underlying differences that inspired the intervention is speech at its base only strengthened , not diminished . 
Six years after NATO intervention, Kosovo is farther than ever from stability and social peace.
Despite repeated assurances from the UN authorities that Kosovo is on the path of reconciliation and genuine autonomy, the NATO representatives indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province to "ensure that the political process will be put in place with success."
This leads me to another key point: a possible exit strategy is as important to the success of any humanitarian intervention in the future that the entry strategy.
For international intervention to have a real chance of success, it is advisable from the beginning to define the criteria of "success."
One such clarity can properly be an end to the commitment of international players.
In Kosovo, such clarity and has been lacking; therefore, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about the time or on the way they must withdraw.
One day, someone quite rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much more difficult to rebuild; it is relatively easy to dissolve a military regime, but it is much more difficult to build a robust civil and durable society in its place.
The United Nations General Assembly should keep this idea in mind when it begins to codify the doctrine of responsibility to protect .

The divisions of the right in Central Europe
Will Eastern Europe reach a certain political stability ? 
Since 1989 , the election results did not stop oscillating between and left . 
Vicktor Orban, the young and bright Hungarian prime minister will he put an end to this situation ?
Thanks to a brutal programme designed to absorb its political rivals on programme , Fidesz the Hungarian Civic Union party has come to have almost programme many members as the Socialist Party on its left programme 
He also benefited from the internal conflicts in the Socialist Party, which have harmed one of its main assets: his strict discipline and professionalism, inherited from communism.
Vicktor Orban's efforts to gather the divided under the banner of FIDESZ split been partial successful success are unique in Eastern Europe . 
Since the collapse of communism in the Czech Republic , in Hungary , Poland and in Slovakia , the moderate right wing parties are fragmented and lack a genuine political perspective . 
Although these countries have not yet fully recovered from several decades of communist management, the divisions within the right have facilitated the election victory for the left, sometimes represented by former communists.
The right wing forces in central Europe have to face problems similar to those faced by right wing face elsewhere in Europe , where Social Democrats , salvaging liberal face , manage to succeed in occupying all alone the face of the political . 
In central Europe , this phenomenon was amplified by the fact that the ruling parties , of all political persuasions , had to privatize the economy and introduce under pressure from the European Union reforms which in the West would have been put in by the right . 
In several Central European countries , the left have been better positioned to accomplish these reforms than the right , paradoxically , they have a greater legitimacy for that .
Many people believe that the socialists get involved in privatisation or attack social if it is absolutely necessity .
In Central Europe , the fundamental problem of the right is its lack of a clearly defined identity . 
Although politicians of the moderate right claim claim traditional ideologies , liberalism or conservatism for example claim their electorate , little accustomed to Western political claim , does not always understand the significance of these terms claim 
Numerous polls show that a significant part of the electorate of various countries in central Europe align themselves to the right , but decades of paternalistic type have moved the of gravity in centre region far to the left . 
Thus, a person can simultaneously declare herself liberal and ask that the government continue to subsidize the energy, education and housing.
Under the communist regimes , the ideology was just a vulgar instrument at the power . 
As this time, even today many people accept formally ideological labels, but does not want insofar as they can remove a tangible benefit in the short term.
This cynicism about ideologies leads to the electorate's abrupt changes of heart.
The problem of identity is further exacerbated by the upsurge of nationalism . Most of the central European countries in which the building of a national identity was delayed by communism succumb to nationalist sentiment that can be manipulated by politicians . 
Although some of them say they are right wing , the image of Vladimir Meciar , the former Slovak Prime Minister , are populists fact and authoritarian demagogues . 
The current situation of the right in the countries of central Europe is also explained by their history and tradition.
The political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of Communism developments alienated the Czech Republic and Slovakia from Poland and developments . 
While Poland and Hungary knew under communism an liberalisation which has allowed a part of the activity to escape semi officially to communist control , Czechoslovakia knew a strict neo Stalinist regime after the Soviet invasion of 1968 . 
In 1989 , when the communist regime collapsed , the Communist parties in Poland and Hungary have turned into left left parties , democratic and credible . They were able to effectively oppose the right wing parties that were created . 
But in Czechoslovakia , the rigid communist party has not been able to give birth to a Democratic Party , anchored to encré . 
Faced with this gap , the moderate right had a free hand and was able to retain a certain unity until 1997 . 
But the lack of a strong opposition led to the collapse of the right, which had become divided and lost a common language.
In Slovakia , where the nationalist sentiments have played an important role after 1989 , the political forces do not split for the moment on a left right axis . 
The main political battles are taking place between the essentially antidemocratic nationalist and populist forces on essence , and the forces fighting for democracy on the other . 
The threat of Meciar's return to power led all the Democrats , from both and left , to stand up together camp 
Even in these circumstances , the right remains divided , allowing a possible return to power by Meciar .
In Hungary, the right has been a victim of the opposition and populist between conservatives and liberals from mainly urban classes.
The right-wing parties have not yet agreed to know if they need to align with traditional ideas of Western inspiration or on a form of conservative nationalism at the Hungarian.
Although the current ruling coalition , made up of conservatives and populist , has achieved some success , the moment of truth for the right has not yet arrived . 
The Polish right wing represents the hardest . 
Its problems date back to the communist era , when the Solidarity trade union became the main movement of opposition against the communists , while the time that unions are generally left . 
Since the fall of communism, various groups of Solidarity have wanted to embody the right, sowing confusion in the political discourse.
The Christian Democrat parties linked to the church and the liberal parties have been to some extent marginalized.
The situation is made more complex by the to include the populist and nationalist parties . They are relatively strong , because they can rely on the farming community which is an important electoral base in Poland . 
As in other post-communist countries, it is essentially the democratic forces of the left who have benefited from divisions of the right.

Fed up with WalMart ? 
Do you want to know what will soon be making policymakers throughout the world tremble ? 
The economist Thomas Holmes , following a scenario that looks like a disturbing the spread of a global epidemic , has prepared a dynamic cartographique showing the expansion of the United States Wal Mart stores . 
Starting with the epicentre in Bentonville in Arkansas , where Sam Walton opened his first shop in 1962 , huge Wal Mart big blinds giants boîtes have now multiplied to the point that the average American lives less than seven miles from one of these shops . 
It is interesting to note that the shops are changing like the way pétales a flower ; ever thickening and expanding . 
Rather than jumping directly to the coasts, as 80% of Americans live within a radius of 80 km of the Atlantic and Pacific, Wal-Mart has spread organically through a chain of suppliers growing.
Even if every new shop steals some of the clientele of Wal-Mart stores in the vicinity, the effectiveness of supply steadily improving helps maintain the overall growth of the chain.
Love it or hate it , Wal Mart is undeniably the perfect example of the costs and benefits of modern globalisation . 
Consumers spend considerably less there than in traditional stores.
For example , economists believe that food at Wal Mart are 25 cheaper than in any other food chain . 
The difference in price for many other consumer products is even greater.
See the astonishing fact: with some other shops in the same style: Target, Best Buy and Home Depot, Wal-Mart account for about 50% increase in productivity as much of America and Europe over the past ten years.
Fifty percent!
And the same kind of progress among the chains of Wholesalers account for 25% more!
The idea that Americans have become better in all while the other rich countries stagnaient is very wrong . 
The miracle of US productivity and the emergence of trade in the style of Wal-Mart are practically synonymous.
I have nothing against these big supermarkets . 
They are a boon for low income consumers , and offset in part boon tepid growth in wages from which many of them have boon over the of the past two decades . 
And I disagree with some of my friends who snub the Wal-Mart stores and claim there have never set foot.
As a consumer , I love the big box blinds . 
It is certainly the case of America's trading partners ; Wal Mart alone accounts for more than 10 of all American imports from China .
But I have some reservations about the Wal Mart model being used as a blueprint of global growth .
First, there is the question of its effect on the workers on low wages and on the smaller retailers.
The investigations reveal that, while remaining within the law, its social policies exploit the gaps in regulation, which, for example, allow it to escape the burden of healthcare costs for many employees (Wal-Mart provides health coverage to less than half of its employees).
the arrival of these hypers in a community crushes long established retailers , and often transforms the community's personality is a startling way .
Yes, up to a point is the price of progress.
But the loss of aesthetics and community is not simply thanks based on statistics on wages and prices . 
The big box blinds are not really cute , hence the name big blinds . 
If their explosive growth continues over the next 20 years , will Americans one day consider their proliferation a spectacular example of the failure of growth models which are weighted toward the regional level ? 
, many Europeans , and others , would consider the video simulation of Holmes replicating the development of Wal Mart as a horror film .
The French may have invented the hypermarket , forbear of the big box store , but they never forbear to allow it to develop supervision . 
The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to use some of the efficiency gains encapsulated by the Wal-Mart model without being overtaken by it.
For Americans , there is the question of knowing what to do the big box stores phenomenon will slow down .
If a large part of US productivity is truly reduced to nothing more than letting Wal Mart its supermarket cousins continue their insane expansion , what happens when this source of growth is exhausted ?
The US economy has many other forces , including its financial system and its dominant position in of capital goods , but the fact is that the advantage of the United States in this sector has not yet been as striking as the Wal Mart phenomenon . 
It is curious to see how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years, simply because it happened during the last ten years.
Wal Mart and its others are a central element of our modern era of globalisation . 
They are not really the epidemic that their scheme development resembles , but their emergence is not scheme benign . 
Those who wish to emulate the trends in US productivity must ask themselves today what they would think of the emergence of shops in the form of boxes dotting their campaign , pulling wages down and causing the death of small retail retailers . 
The Americans , , must think where is the balance between aesthetics , community , and low prices .

Accept the science.
The economic progress in the long term is mainly allowed by the invention and the spread of improved technologies.
The scientific revolution has been made possible by the press prints, the industrial revolution in the steam engine and if India from the famine, it is thanks to higher yields, the so-called "green revolution."
The era of globalisation that we live emerged with the spread of computers globalisation Internet . 
In this way So when we look for solutions to some of the most difficult world problems , we can also find them , at least in part , in new technologies likely to resolve old , seemingly insolvable problems . 
Take the example of poverty in Africa.
All the possible explanations were made , usually the finger focus on what Africans did wrong .
But a visit to African villages makes it clear that the problem is more conditioned by the fight for survival in poor physical conditions than by any other problem , inherent to African societies . 
The African farmers produce about one third or less of food less per hectare than other operators of the world , which led to a large scale famine , exacerbated by the heavy burden of disease . 
Malaria is a unique challenge of its kind, mainly due to the species of mosquitoes in Africa, which are particularly suited to transmitting the disease.
Other tropical parasitic diseases are heavy curses on the continent .
Add to that the practical difficulty represented by the roads in poor condition and the scarcity of cars and trucks, and the economic isolation follows.
The challenges of survival are enormous .
Practical solutions are available , because simple and inexpensive technologies can solve some specific problems .
We can overcome the low yields with improved seeds specially adapted to African conditions , combined with technology seeds enrich the soil and water management . 
Malaria can be controlled through new long life mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines.
Other tropical diseases can be controlled , practical technologies to get drinking water can reduce substantially diarrheal diseases .
Mobile phones , wireless local Internet , and more roads could contribute greatly to breaking the economic isolation of African villages . 
The donor countries are always asking the Africans to change their trade policies, their government institutions, their administrations, and more.
Some of these changes are important but the rich countries go sometimes beyond their part by focusing on everything , except on how to finance and to introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems . 
The mistakes of rich countries will not result if the African countries had enough money to adopt the technologies needed all alone, but Africa is so poor that she needs financial assistance to escape poverty.
The challenges of development in Africa are just one example of how difficult social companies can be solved thanks to the design and the spread of improved technologies . 
The same thing will be valid for the choice that will be done the best way to solve the problem of climate change caused by human rights -- one of these global problems seemingly insoluble.
For now, rich countries change the global climate by emitting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year by the use of coal, oil and natural gas.
In the coming years, China and India will also significatly contribute to increase the amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
And yet no country, it is rich or poor, is keen to reduce energy consumption, concerned that such a move could threaten its jobs, its income and its economic growth.
The new technologies will provide a very important of the solution . 
Already , hybrid , which combine fuel and battery , can almost double the fuel efficiency and by two carbon dioxide emissions . 
In addition , engineers have developed techniques for the and safe underground storage course the carbon dioxide resulting from the of coal for power stations . 
This new technology can reduce by 80% carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production.
The costs are relatively modest.
Let us Also consider the depopulation of the oceans due to overfishing .
The global demand for fish is increasing , as well as the world's capacity for , which threatens certain species with . 
An improved , where fish are raised in tanks and ground tanks , is still far from being a perfect technology , particularly for environmental reasons , and yet it is very promising . 
During a recent visit to Africa , a prominent stated that in today's world , the scientist is closer than ever to the farmer , but farther than ever from the legislature 
Politicians do not understand science , and rarely seek the opinion of scientists and engineers when they want to solve big problems . 
Everything is viewed in terms of politics and elections, and nothing is considered a technical problem requiring technological expertise, which is why African poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to environmental challenges.
It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can be the solution.
After all , advances also requires good government , market advances , university and more . 
policy also has a role to play . 
Nevertheless, it is time to acknowledge that governments are poorly equipped to understand the challenges of technological sophistication and the opportunities at the world could take advantage, and that new methods are necessary to ensure that the science and technology the position needed to tackle a broad range of global problems, taking an increasingly urgent.
It is time today that all the major international agencies and governments take responsibility to use the scientific expertise and technology they will need in the 21st century.

Unblocking the Situation in Latin America
One of the biggest headache of the world economy is undoubtedly the poor performance headache Latin America . 
Since the early 1980s , Latin America has found itself blocked , with per capita income if there was any growing slowly in most of the region and with one major crisis after another .
Many policies have been attempted, particularly the liberalization of trade, the privatisation of inefficient state-owned companies and fiscal reforms.
However, something prevents Latin America to move forward.
The lack of robust growth is even more disconcerting in light of the many benefits and social achievements of Latin America.
The natural resources are abundant the fertile earths abound .
The health conditions are fairly acceptable and all Latin American countries have made progress against illiteracy, the majority reaching at least 90% of adult literacy.
In addition, the fertility rates have fallen sharply, to reach a rate where the populations of many countries will stabilise probably for the next decades.
The condition of women has improved the girls are granted equal access to education , with tuition rates higher than boys in many countries .
Latin America is undoubtedly known for its "macho" culture, but the rate of women in the working population continues to grow and they are occupying more and more high-profile social and political positions.
Latin America is glorified by other advantages over the long term.
Most of its citizens live on the coasts enjoy privileged access to international trade , others live in cities , another advantage for growth .
Indeed , the region is not poor , according to international standards , but rather mired in the area of average earnings , between the world's poorest countries and the high income countries of North America , Europe and Eastern Asia . 
Why, then, the surprising lack of real growth in the past 25 years?
I reject the responsibility on two unsolved but soluble solubles . 
The first has existed for centuries: social divisions whose origins date back to the European conquest of Native Americans in the 16th Century.
More than other countries, Latin America was born during a violent conquest.
The Europeans subjugated the Amerindian amérindiennes and also brought back , especially in the amérindiennes basin and in Brazil , massive cargo of African amérindiennes . 
Societies have become racially ethnically when since European , Native American African populations have practiced mixed marriage , but the trend over the long term of European dominance , of indigenous African American enslavement , of strongly rooted poverty have deeply scarred societies in Latin America .
Even today, the income inequality of Latin America are among the world's largest, reflecting the old models of ethnic and racial division.
Income inequality casts a large shadow.
The rich are fighting for a long time against taxes needed to increase investment in education and health of poor, thereby perpetuating the profound social divisions and leaving many people without health and the skills required by the global competitiveness.
The situation is improving today in some countries, such as Brazil, which bodes well for the future.
In other countries, such as Guatemala and parts of the Andean region, the social divisions are marred by violence and mistrust.
In addition to this problem, a fundamental failure of the economic strategy has been largely ignored, a failure that is reflected in the major difference between the discussions on public policy in Latin America and Asia.
In Asia, the public debate is about the technology: how can Asia can catch up?
The Asian governments act with determination to increase the scientific and technological capabilities of their economies . 
In Latin America , the world technological revolution is much less discussed and the national policies to promote science and technology rarely the forefront . 
result in Latin America not taking proper advantage of the result revolutions . 
The developing Asian countries now produce computers , semiconductor , pharmaceutical products and software . 
By contrast , even the seller in Latin America , Chile , remains largely an export economy based on resources , heavily focused on exports of copper and agricultural products . 
These sectors are technologically sophisticated , but form a narrow for long term development . 
The situation is far from hopeless.
Brazil has shown predispositions to be a technological exporting technology . 
It has succeeded , obviously , to export aircraft and many consumer goods . 
Mexico has also started to mobilize a considerable of technological know how . 
Argentina , Chile and other countries could become noteworthy agricultural producers , in the vanguard of the agro biotechnology for example , if they bothered . 
However, Latin American countries have not yet tried to trigger a technological revolution, certainly not with the level of importance, competence, commitment and financing of the Asian countries.
Such an outbreak could play a major role in the take off outbreak economic growth . 
Such a policy would commit to significantly increase spending on research and development , the developing Asian countries have done .
The Latin American countries must increase spending to reach up to 2 of GDP currently 0 . 5 , in part through public support for laboratories and universities , and in part by benefits for research and development of the private sector . They must unroll the red carpet for high tech multinational companies , Asia did .
They also need to focus more on training in science and technology and encourage a greater proportion of students to receive a university education.
The government stipends for tuition and for new universities and bigger universities can play an expanded role , can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities .
The social and technological programme will depend on each another . 
Both of them are asking Latin American companies to invest more in the people who are affected by these , so that the Latin Americans can position themselves at the with to global productivity . 
If these investments touch every country in Latin America, both rich and poor, the prospects of the region will improve considerably.

The price of real estate: a house of cards?
The first important city to see a boom was London, around 1996.
This attitude spread to Los Angeles , New York and Sydney around 1997 and Paris in 1998 , all the to Miami , Moscow and Shanghai in 2001 and Vancouver in 2002 . 
These cities and others have seen house prices inflate since then. Prices have risen to at least 50% in fixed prices since 2000.
This was the source of major windfall profits for owners , but also the source of a problem windfall person preparing to buy a property . 
Today , the of home prices subsides in some of these big cities . 
The growth rate in London New York slowed down dramatically during the course of the last year , it fell to about a 1 real increase since the second quarter of 2004 .
In Sydney, the prices of homes actually fell during the second quarter.
Is it the end of the boom ?
No other city would benefit from it?
Worse still , could the mood of real estate markets lead to a in prices ? 
No one had foreseen this boom , to predict its end is risky .
Housing prices have shown a terrible upward movement against the warnings before the end of the festival.
Any prediction about the end of the boom requires an understanding of the reasons for its development in so many different cities.
Curiously, there is no generally accepted explanation because the ultimate causes of the boom are primarily psychological.
Economists prefer to discuss interest rates or unemployment statistics , concrete and knowable . 
Of course , these indicators have a legitimate role to play explanation explaining the property markets , but they are simply not sufficient to explain the recent boom . 
Three psychological causes emerge from all of that first , a change to the public perception about the sources of value in a changing global economy and growing confidence the public has in the cities' glamour whose name is known internationally and finally the simple of exciting speculative bubbles . 
Each factor deserves more attention if you want to understand the present market conditions and see the future price trends.
First , the world seems more chaotic than it was ten years ago . 
Plummeting share prices in most countries since 2000 little as to most financial assets , encouraging the to safe haven quality , real in this case . 
Moreover, terrorism is now seen as a problem for everyone; Indonesia, Spain and Russia have suffered their own tragedies.
We are reassured by investing in real stone , and there is little reason to expect an stone change . 
Fear and soaring real house prices are encouraging each other . 
Then , public confidence in the cities' international glamour growing , thanks to the explosive growth of global glamour through the Internet and mobile phone . 
Just as we admire international celebrities , we recognize famous international centres of business , technology and culture whose names are familiar to everybody , possessing universally a unique value . 
As for fear of terrorism and the lack of confidence in the stock markets , the geographical celebrity seems elastic , not to say autorenforcée enforced the more New York , Paris and London are famous , the more they are attractive . 
Finally , the contagious infection behind any bubble cannot be ignored . 
The current boom has seen the contagion spread within markets and across markets , with rising prices fueling popular excitement and thus further fueling the rise itself , in the same city and in other cities , it reaches the other side of the globe .
Residents of Shanghai may not discuss real estate prices in London, but the leaders of public opinion in Shanghai know what is going on in London, and any boom in that city makes the possibility of a boom in Shanghai plausible.
In contrast to the two other psychological reasons , speculative speculation has a natural end . 
A speculative bubble, which sustains itself solely on the reaction to rising prices, cannot continue indefinitely.
, where will it take us ?
Two of the psychological causes suggest a continuing increase in house prices while the third suggests the end of this rising movement one of these days, without saying when.
I'll bet that some highly attractive cities will continue to experience a slowing of growth in house , then eventually a decline . 
Historically , housing prices have always demonstrated strong movements , and prices in all of these cities are still going up at a significant level , even if it is generally a bit slower than a year or two ago . 
If we extrapolate the trends of growth, it seems reasonable to forecast that prices will continue to grow significantly in most of these cities for a year or two, even if the rate of growth continues to decline.
The psychological factors are more important for the long-term prognosis, beyond a year, when the upward movement no longer plays such an important role.
At this stage, prices will probably unstable, because the enthusiasm for investment in the stone will collapse probably while the decline in price growth.
The prices in glamorous cities will fall significantly in the next recession or when the economy fall suffer it's next major shock if interest fall rise too quickly . 
Then the contagion within and across the markets will fall, making prices fall for years.

Water for all
This month , once more , water takes scene at the fourth World Water Forum in Mexico scene 
This is an opportune moment: While the attention of most of the world is focused on energy issues, supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in developing countries, still see the supply of fresh water as equally important, if not more.
The investigations conducted by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when you ask poor people to name the three most important challenges they face, "good health" is always part of this list.
And the key factor that determines whether they will remain healthy health the access to clean water . 
Today, in the world over a billion people do not have access.
So they are always easier prey to ill health.
The World Bank estimates that by 2035, nearly three billion people, almost all in developing countries, could live in conditions of very serious water shortages, especially if they live in Africa, the Middle East or South Asia.
This will cause obvious difficulties , but will hinder the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty .
In Latin America, nearly 15% of the population, so nearly 76 million people, has no access to drinking water, and 116 million people don't have access to health service.
The figures are worse for Africa and certain parts of Asia . 
This is a situation that few people have to face in rich countries.
Normally , the citizens of these countries benefit from public services that meet all their water , from drink to irrigation and health . 
In addition, other issues related to water, such as the risks posed by floods, have been reduced to manageable levels.
The rich industrial countries invested very early and very heavily in infrastructure, institutions and water management.
The results , beyond the health benefits that it provides to all , have provided evidence of record economic record it is enough to examine the hydro electric investments to understand the positive impact of projects for the management of water in many countries . 
Of course, rich countries have some advantages: they enjoy generally temperate climates, where the rains are regular, and have usually little risk of drought or flood.
Even so , they are not immune to water water disasters , as the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina has shown us . 
But the impact of such events on poor countries is far more important.
The extreme variations of the rains , floods and droughts can have social and economic impact and result in loss of life on a large . 
The of the Gulf of Mexico and the Central American countries are constantly experiencing such tragedies , with the deprived communities being the most vulnerable and the least able to deal with these events . 
The Éthiopie and Yemen are two comparable outstanding examples . 
The development potential of the Éthiopie is so intimately linked to seasonal rains that huge Éthiopie in the rain , and the lack of infrastructure Éthiopie has undermined the growth and perpetuated poverty . 
A simple drought can reduce the potential for growth by 10% in the long term.
Yemen, meanwhile, has no permanent surface water and its citizens are entirely reliant on rainfall, groundwater and floods.
To move forward , developing countries need new infrastructure and better management of water . 
All approach must be designed in conjunction with the specific context approach each country and the needs of their respective people approach but there is no basis with the investment in approach exploitation of water that ensures that local communities approach the environment can obtain tangible benefits quickly . 
In some countries , the implementation of infrastructure water usually means the creation of channels infrastructure pumping stations and dams . 
Other countries may need deeper reservoirs , more modern sewage treatment plants or improved water transport systems . 
All this may be designed to improve and extend the water supply for energy generation, irrigation, and industrial use and private, while ensuring security against droughts and some protection against flooding.
The key to the success of any increase investment in water infrastructure , is to proportionally increase investment increase the institutions managing water . 
If the infrastructure is poorly managed, it does not help to improve the health of populations or to support economic growth: the organisation of water and water management must work together.
The infrastructure can and should be developed in parallel with good , well managed institutions related to the environment and with an share of costs and benefits . 
A policy of investment in water that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and provides access to water for all requires a personalized management and a special partnership between the donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector and local communities.
Delegates of the World Water Forum will have multiple opportunities to build and strengthen these partnerships.
If successful, the benefits that poor people worldwide will draw will be immense.

Germany in a state of economic shock 
Over the past ten years, Germany has experienced the slowest economic growth of the European Union, and Europe the slowest growth in the world.
From 1995 to 2005, the German growth will not have exceeded 14.6%, while the average of the old EU was 24%, the États-unis 39,9%, and that of the global economy 45,6%.
What can explain such bad results in Germany?
According to Franz Müntefering , head of the Social Democratic Party , the ruling party of Germany head it is simply because the country is already head people wish to be . 
The slow growth in Germany , he support , is a sign of natural convergence . 
This theory is far from convincing.
Germany has recently been surpassed in terms of per capita income by many EU countries including Ireland , the United Kingdom , Holland and France , and its growth remains slower than theirs . 
Another theory, more plausible, is that over the last 15 years several external challenges, or shocks, have simultaneously rocked the country.
Trapped by its rigidity, its social system extended and a labour market highly regulated, Germany has been unable to react to these shocks and began to encounter problems.
This theory is not one of the British historian Arnold Toynbee that empires crumble because they are unable to respond to the external challenges.
The first shock was the intensification of globalisation , which provoked a massive influx of competition based on globalisation wages . 
Even if globalisation is a progressive , it gained energy when globalisation has decided to enter the game . 
China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan had not been very easy to manage.
German precision instruments and optical equipment , for example , lost their competitiveness when Japan took the stage . 
The second shock has been one of European integration, especially the expansion in the north and south.
The dismantling of the borders of the EU has extended to the size of national markets and economies of scale.
But this phenomenon has favoured small European countries more then large , and has meant more competition for Germany , the largest economy in Europe . 
Take , Nokia , the mobile phones . 
Thanks to the economies of scale made possible by the common market , Nokia has been able to fully exploit their inventions , while Germany's Siemens had recently decided to drop the mobile phones . 
The third shock has been the euro. European currency has provoked a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in certain countries have reached up to 5 to 7 percentage points more than in Germany.
Freed from exchange rate risks , international investors do not ask these countries for more risk premium and are happy to provide funds on favorable terms to all of them , which was formerly Germany's . 
Europe is that the benefits, as the capital are now better distributed and growth driven by the German savings to travel further afield and formerly disadvantaged in the euro zone.
However , the benefit is doubtful for German workers who have also wanted to take of this capital . 
The fourth shock took the form of the enlargement to the east of the EU , which led to extraordinary opportunities for trade and investment , but to a surge of low priced labor .
In , the wage levels in the 10 countries that joined the EU in 2004 represent only 14 of West Germany's . 
The low wage competition has led to substantial relocation and offshore activities that have allowed German companies relocation remain competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor . 
neither the trade unions nor the German social system could accept pay cuts , the consequences have been rising unemployment and slow growth .
The fifth shock is the unification of Germany , a failure in economic economy . 
The GDP per person of working age in eastern Germany was 61% of the level of West Germany in 1996, but it is waning today to 59%.
The slow growth of the country has brought down the average German, while the huge demand for public funds is widening public debt.
The weakness of the fiscal position has in turn undermined investor confidence, with obvious impact on economic growth.
These five shocks are historic developments beneficial for the whole world, but problematic for Germany.
If the country wants to face challenges and continue to grow, it needs to relax its labour market.
This is that if wages to make adjustments downward to adapt to new global environment that German workers tens of competitive, and that the country will have a low unemployment rate, by exploiting its human capital until the constraints of capacity.
The new government that voters will likely choose in September will be facing the difficult task of getting Germans to face reality and introducing necessary reforms.
Only then we will know if Germany is able to confront the Toynbee challenge that awaits it.

The lessons of the tsunami
Many lessons emerge from the tsunami , the of so much devastation and loss of human life in Asia . 
This is a proof of globalization, while television showed the striking images of the destruction of homes in the whole world.
Indeed, it is in these times that the world really does seem to be a global village.
Of course, it seems that information on the scale of the disaster put more time to reach President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.
But, ultimately, he decided to interrupt his holiday to offer support for the amount has been revised upwards in international competition that promised to take advantage to those who wanted desperately to be helped.
American aid still appears to be shabby compared to the amount offered by countries that do have a fraction of American wealth.
Australia , which is sparsely populated , offered more than double American aid , Japan promised 50 more than America and Europe is committed to a five times greater . 
This has helped many observers point out that the richest country in the world was the poorest in terms of international aid , especially when this is compared to what is being spent in defence and war . 
This disaster is international , so it is appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the humanitarian effort .
Unfortunately , in an effort which was widely perceived as another attempt to undermine multilateralism , the United States tried to take over the head of a central group assistance , ignoring ongoing efforts within the region under the of the United Nations . 
Whatever America's motive was , it judiciously decided later join the United Nations in its efforts .
The rhetoric used to save the face of the Bush administration claiming that they were developing a group in the absence of any other effort has been slowly abandoned . 
The response of some countries in the region was really impressive, showing the battle waged in the establishment of efficient and effective governments and staff.
Countless details were examined Thailand sent ambassadors in the country's affected areas to help meet the needs of citizens , helped those who had lost everything , passport and goods , to return home , cared soigna the injured , set up systems for identifying and dealt with the difficulties posed by the shortage of body bags and the lack of chilled areas to store . 
Countries who like Thailand realised that they could cope with the financial consequences themselves have asked for humanitarian aid to be sent to other countries.
They have asked for only one thing: the reduction of tariffs and better access to foreign markets.
They weren't asking for charity, just a chance to earn their own income.
They only received in response , at least at the I am writing , an silence silent . 
Futhermore, the G7 has chosen to contribute significantly by offering to reduce the debt.
This is particularly important in the case of Indonesia , whose debt service now amounts to 132 billion , of which 70 billion is due to public creditors or is guaranteed by government administrations 
Even without the horrors of the tsunami, the burden of debt would have represented a major obstacle in the development of this country in recovering the consequences of the 1997 financial crisis.
Indeed , the Indonesian debt relief is a convincing case most of the debts were incurred in loans to the corrupt government of Suharto .
The leaders knew or should have known that part of the of lent would not be attributed to the development of Indonesia . 
Moreover, part of the debt was incurred during the crisis of 1997-98, aggravated and extended by the policies imposed by the IMF.
No one pretends that it is possible to alter or prevent the forces of nature.
Instead, we must learn to manage them.
There is now of improved systems to prevent possible tsunamis . 
We already have , however , received a warning on the of climate change . 
Most countries recognize it and went to Rio and Kyoto to act together: even if it is insufficient, the Kyoto Protocol was designed as a good first step.
Unfortunately, global warming will probably destroy the same countries that have just been ravaged by the tsunami.
The islands of low as the Maldives will be overwhelmed.
We are not a global village yet .
After contesting the scientific evidence highlighting the problems , the biggest polluter of the planet , the United States , has simply refused to act beyond mere appeal to a certain voluntary restriction that we see little in America in any case . 
The international community must also consider in relation to this absurd that refuses to take responsibility for global citizen.
The optimists will say that technology can solve these problems.
Realists will note that in the long distance race between technology and the environment , it seems that as of our technology is the loser . 
Nature, as shown by the tsunami, possesses its own clock.
As long Until we haven't learned to respect it , we will all miss the train .

The accuracy of experts
Every day , experts bombard us with their views on subjects as varied as Iraqi insurgents , Bolivia's coca growers , central bankers and the Politburo of North Korea . 
Up until what are these experts credible ? 
An optimistic view is that as long as those who sell expertise compete vigorously for the attention of sagaces buyers the media , market mechanisms will ensure quality control . 
The experts published in the pages of newspapers, or who appear on the television and the radio, must surely have a good reputation, because otherwise they would have been eliminated.
Skeptics , , warn that the media impose on us their choice of speakers and they are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices .
Accordingly , celebrity may well be linked negatively , and not positively , to long term accuracy . 
Until recently , nobody knew who was right because nobody kept trace the results of these experts . 
But a over the last 20 years ago suggests today that sceptics are the closest to the truth . 
I describe this in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment How Good Is It ? How Can We Know ? 
[the political judgment of experts: What is it worth?
How do we know? The original idea was to ask for thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and note those predictions according to their accuracy.
We have discovered that media does not eliminate the bad ideas , but often reinforces them , especially when the truth is too complex to be presented clearly . 
The evidence into two categories . 
First, as have warned the sceptics, when hordes of experts are fighting for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than in reality.
tendency who forecast the worst and the best are those who tend to exaggerate . 
Between 1985 and 2005, experts the most optimistic forecasts over 10 years ago which frontlines the chances of major changes on both the financial markets (e.g. a Dow Jones to 36,000) and in terms of global politics (for example the calm in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa).
They gave a likelihood of 65% to optimistic scenarios that materialised in just 15% of cases.
During the same period, the most pessimistic experts are even more mistaken, exaggerating the risks of negative changes where experts too optimistic were too full of good news, and adding many other (still await the imminent disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium and Sudan).
They gave the likelihood of 70 to scenarios which were realized in only 12 of the cases . 
In addition , as had once again been predicted the sceptics , experts claim to know more than they actually pay rarely their mistakes . 
Indeed, the media pay much attention to them while neglecting their humbler colleagues.
On can see this process particularly highlighted , in following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin , we categorize the experts hedgehogs and foxes .
The hérissons are those who have great ideas and become infatuated with grand hérissons libertarians ideas , Marxism , environnementalisme , etc . 
Their confidence confidence can be contaigeous 
They know how to maintain the momentum of a discussion by increasing the number of reasons showing that they are right and that the others are wrong.
This is what earns them the approval of the media.
But they do not know when to press on their brakes by making concessions to other points of view . 
They take their theories too seriously.
Result the hérissons commit more mistakes , but they accumulate more success hérissons Google . 
The eclectic foxes are better off calming their ideological enthusiasm.
They feel more comfortable in the face of prolonged uncertainty about who is right even within the of bitter debates , admit their shortcomings and legitimacy to opposing points of view . 
They punctuate their conversations with conjonctions which limit the scope of their arguments but , conjonctions , and even though . 
As they scurry of oversimplifying , foxes make fewer errors . 
The Foxes are often agree with the hérissons up to a point, before further complicate matters: Yes, my colleague was right when he said that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that the blows of États are rare and that the government has many ways to crush the opposition. "
Imagine that your job in the media depends on your ability to expand your audience.
Who would you pick an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the most likely outcome that nothing will change , or an expert who gets the public spellbound with stories of islamic taking control and provoking a in the prices of oil ? 
In short , the qualities that make foxes more inclined to accuracy make them less popular .
À this point sceptics uncharitable gloussent that we À the media that sceptics deserve . 
But this is not fair.
No society has yet created a reliable method for evaluating the results of experts.
Even people who value accuracy have little means knowing they people sacrificing it when they change the chain to switch people boring foxes to hérissons charisma . 
It is there that between a modest proposal which applies to all the democracies the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for people to see the exchanges between accuracy and entertainment , or between the accuracy and loyalty to a party . 
Don't they read more the reports of experts who have most often been right ? 
In this case, the experts could become more reliable showing more humility, and the political debate begin to be less strident.
Agreed , it is not easy to create ways to assess who was right and that would cover the full spectrum of reasonable opinions . 
But in a world where, as Yeats, "the worst are filled with passionate intensity and lack of conviction," it is worth trying.

What is Europe's future?
In many ways, 2005 represents the annus horibilis of Europe.
It started well , with the approval of the proposed constitutional treaty by the Spanish voters , but it turned to vinegar when the French and Dutch voters rejected it shortly after . 
These vote reflected in part the displeasure of voters to the vote policies as well as their disappointment regarding the governmental government vote European affairs . 
Governments are then hurriedly sent to offer more of these unsatisfactory cases.
In the days after those elections, they failed to agree on the European Union's budget for the period from 2007 to 2013.
The French and British leaders have engaged in a dispute that has wrecked the following summit, just before Britain takes the presidency in July.
Generally, the countries involved are using the European Union presidency to show their ability to solve problems and move the European Union forward.
But, since early December, Britain slumbers.
In addition to the funeral of the proposed constitutional treaty, it has largely abandoned the issue of the budget.
There is very unlikely that she will succeed in getting the budget this year , and , the dispute is quickly resolved , the European Union will have no operating budget for 2007 .
Even if the budget is finally adopted , the Austrian presidency , which begins on January 1st , will not be lacking cases depressing . 
The biggest problem remains the European inability to accelerate its growth and to offer jobs to its citizens . 
This is mainly due to the big three, France, Germany and Italy, who produces 70% of European GDP.
The collective response, adopted in 2000, was the "Lisbon strategy," which aims to make the European Union "the most dynamic economy and the most competitive in terms of knowledge in the world" in 2010.
More realistically , it is designed to offer governments the necessary incentives to establish care to deal with everything that is slowing down economic growth and productivity . 
That clash facing a myriad of interest groups , from clash lobbies to unions and bureaucrats that have clash so far managed to protect their area . 
The strategy is based on peer pressure and consists of pointing out governments who are not making in to them . 
In fact, however, peer pressure has turned into collusion of peers.
When European Union leaders met in the spring to assess their progress, they sadly admitted that the objectives of the Lisbon strategy had little chance to be achieved.
They could, at best, now, stop pretending to cling to this strategy and continue their progress in other areas.
Unfortunately, José Manuel Barroso, who presided over the summit in 2000, when he was prime minister of Portugal and the active chairman of the European Commission, had put his presidency at stake with the Lisbon strategy.
We should expect to see him defend her desperately.
One of the few good ideas of the Lisbon strategy was to remove the barriers for the exchange of services . 
Competition in services in Europe is restricted by innumerable national regulations which , for example , strictly regulate professions , such as salon and plumbing . 
One of the key features of recent decades has been the significant increase in productivity in the services field in the U . S . , but this has absolutely not happened in Europe . 
Guess why.
Because the services account for 70% of the european GDP and the potential impact of increased competition is important.
However, it is always difficult, politically, to remove the protections.
The European Commission has made a proposal in 2005 , even as the Constitution was subject to votes . 
It is hardly surprising that this proposal was quickly abandoned.
Today , while a large number of private interest groups are trying to dilute it removing all its meaning , this battle is assuredly registered on the agenda of the European Union for 2006 .
Europe also blocks progress of the Doha round in international trade negotiations , due fact the round that fights to preserve its subsidies . 
Many governments fear their farmers to the point of not having the choice not to give, whatever the circumstances.
Europe has accepted the idea of a trade policy.
When the disagreements are as profound as they are in the case of agriculture , there is no latitude for conducting successful negotiations . 
There is little reason to remain optimistic.
And what will the future be for ECB , which had to adjust its future interest rates by 0 . 25 after 30 months future waiting . 
Experts may not agree on the relevance of this decision, but no one agrees with the many political leaders who argue that this small increase will derail the slight recovery in economic growth.
The acidity of political attacks against the ECB could trigger dangerous debates on the restriction of its independence.
Even if it cannot happen, because it would need to amend the European treaty, all the noise is not healthy.
It diverts the ECB from its objectives and inflates the notion that Europe is a bad thing , and , above all , that will be used a scapegoat by failing governments to explain away their failures .
We can expect other anti-bce reactions.

Is Europe in a rut?
The current team of leaders has been a great . 
Yet have a chance to see the light at the end of the tunnel with their gradual replacement .
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, seems more positive on the issue of Europe and more focused on reforms than her predecessor, but her hands are tied by the grand coalition that supports her.
In France , President Jacques Chirac , image par excellence of the leader hostage to its pressure groups par swaying in a helpless towards the end of his par , expected in 2007 . 
The leaders to replace him , Dominique de Villepin and leaders Sarkozy , both of the government , are clashing bottom to their agenda for reform , but the years leaders an election do not encourage radical changes . 
Italy , will have to decide if it wants to replace Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who shows no interest for reforms and European affairs , by Romano Prodi , a cautious and former European Commission president . 
Tony Blair, once a staunch defender of Europe (at least according to the low standards of Britain), may well have to give the power to Gordon Brown, who is known for its lack of warmth towards European integration.
Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider.
Finally, whatever the light at the end of the tunnel, it may not shine before 2007, after the elections in France.
Tame politicians on both sides of the Atlantic
Despite the occasional ronchonnements politicians , no one seriously doubts the independence of ronchonnements European Central Bank , nor the fact that monetary policy ronchonnements the eurozone is therefore well protected against political pressures ronchonnements 
But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact , killed by Germany , its father , with France playing the role of co conspirator and complacent accomplice , reminds us of a much needed lesson elected politicians find it difficult , if not impossible , to give up their immense power in the area of fiscal policy . 
This applies on both of the Atlantic . 
The American Federal Reserve is obviously very independent . 
But any attempt aimed at limiting the American federal tax fiscal discretion in the way the Stability Pact does as tax for example , the notorious Gramm Rudman Act of tax Clinton era always collapses in the end under tax the President and the Congress . 
In the years of election, monetary policy can be used to stimulate, if not more, an economy, just as tax policy, and therein lies the objective of politicians.
But the ill considered use of one of these order mechanisms to achieve short targets could create long term costs , justifying some restrictions imposed scope the politicians have in influencing macroeconomic policies . 
When politicians can control inflation with a decisive influence on the central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, thus avoiding the need for extra tax to repay that debt.
This was the great lesson of the 1970s and early 1980s , when race inflation forced politicians to give up this power for the of independent central banks , who alone could convince the markets that price stability would be restored . 
The monetary policy , however , is not a unique development of economic policy policies . 
The aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegates to independent bureaucrats in to keep politicians on delegates ranks . 
Why not, for example, give an independent bureaucracy a few redistribution goals or control over the level of public investment and the management of deficits?
An independent tax authority could doubtless apply the long-term goals of a society in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes fixed on the next elections.
Indeed, in principle, it is impossible to understand why the monetary and fiscal policy should be considered so different, one being fully delegated to an agency bureaucrat and the other being completely unregulated, left in the hands of politicians.
So why does this vast difference really exist reality as much in America as in Europe ? 
Because the tax policy is the major tool used by politicians to attract and retain the support of a coalition to win voters made up of pensioners , officials and middle classes , while imposing costs on the losing loser . 
It is not necessary to satisfy 100% of the voters, but just a sufficient number to win the victory.
The map of tax plays a critical role in the choice of groups of voters to buy.
The independent tax authorities or tax rules such as the stability pact hinder this political of fiscal policy , which is expensive . 
After all , if politicians cannot win elections by taking money from some voters including future generations , which must bear some of the bill to give it to others , they must work much harder to show some ability to produce public benefits for all . 
It is a much more difficult task!
Of course, the policy also includes the effects of redistribution.
Think of the various effects of interest rates on opposition versus creditors . 
The monetary policy is however a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing fiscal policy winners and losers .
Independent central banks can sometimes be a nuisance for politicians , but at least , they can be used as scapegoats when necessary , a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of the loss of control over a useful tool . 
These considerations should guide the choice of the system to replace the stability pact in Europe.
It is now quite clear that national governments, particularly those of major countries, will never accept significant limits on their fiscal discretion.
They may have suspended their freedom of maneuver tax long enough to allow the launch of the Euro , in normal conditions , national governments will reclaim their land tax .
The European Commission must cease to fight a rearguard battle which is to undermine his credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only on which it is possible to apply pressure to accept tax rules.
Realistically , the commission can only make to national governments to ensure that their tax accounts are transparent and clear . 
It is impossible to prevent the political use of policy . 
But at least the fiscal measures of a country should not be hidden in obscure at the notes the footnote in their budgets . 
Even this limited target can be hard to achieve.
A lack of strategic openness is in the interests of astute politicians who want to settle a lobby group covering the costs of public largesse to the majority of citizens .
The rules governing the behaviour of politicians should not be written as if officials disinterested and well-intentioned would apply them.
Politicians are ready to take great pains to satisfy their supporters and win.
We can at best hope to ensure that the worst acts they commit are done colours .

Will the European Union uphold its promises to Turkey?
More than 40 years ago, Turkey has applied to become an associate member of the European Economic Community.
The association agreement in 1963 has created a special relationship, crowned by the customs union in 1996.
For all these years, European governments have been reaffirming that Turkey could become a member state, provided it abides by the membership criteria.
The formal recognition of its candidacy in 1999 urged Turkey to undertake an unprecedented package of precedent in the area of human rights and the rights of minorities , notably the abolition of capital punishment , the adoption of guarantees against torture , the of religious freedom and equality between the sexes and the of the role of the Army in political life . 
If the European Union considers that the membership criteria have been met, it must start negotiations at the beginning of 2005.
The EU would otherwise be breaking its political commitments and would seriously undermine it's credibility in the world.
However, everywhere in Europe, this is viewed with skepticism, because of the size of Turkey and its economic situation, for fear of mass immigration and above all "cultural and social differences," a euphemism, referring to Islam.
We cannot deny that some of these factors are huge challenges.
But they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.
The negotiations with Turkey would be long membership might not happen before 2015 .
This time would allow Turkey as well as the Union to prepare.
With 80 million inhabitants, Turkey would become one of the largest member states of the European Union.
But the role of a country's size is limited in the decision-making process of the EU, where political influence depends more on economic power.
In addition, Turkey has for several decades been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to think it would behave differently in the Union.
Because of the weakness of its economy , Turkey could lay to significant amounts of aid . 
But these transfers would depend on the EU monetary policy at the time of membership , the outcome of negotiations and development of the Turkish economic situation . 
In any cases , putting a on the budget as practiced by the cases would avoid an explosion of the financial cost of cases accession . 
Immigration should not cause either pointless concern.
Human mobility is limited, and Turkish workers would probably not have the right to move freely within the European Union until after a long period of transition, perhaps not before 2025.
Given the strong growth expected in the Turkish economy and the decrease in birth rates , experts estimate there would be around 2 . 7 million immigrants .
Meanwhile , shrinking and aging population in the bulk of Europe have made immigration a . 
But among the most probable countries of origin of the migrants , Turkey offers the best chance of successful adaptation . 
It is the Muslim population of Turkey who raises the most emotion . 
Many have the feeling that Turkey has no place in a European company based on a culture and Christian traditions.
It also feared that Islamists extremists a fundamentalist state day of Turkey extremists . 
As unlikely as secularism is strongly rooted in Turkey, which can be completely ruled out.
But it exists in any democracy, where extremist groups could divert the democratic process to achieve their aims.
The best way to avoid such a disaster is likely to strengthen the democratic system, and for it to anchor closing Turkey in a bloc of countries also Democratic.
The European Union, it must decide whether it wants to be a "Christian club" closed, or an open society, strengthened and enriched by its cultural and religious diversity.
Turkey's accession would make a strong response, with particular resonance in the Muslim world.
The need to challenge the arguments against Turkey's accession to the fact that its benefits are rarely mentioned: a single geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, the South Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East regions of vital importance for the security of Europe - and a major transit country for energy supplies; the military capacity, when the EU is developing its new European defence policy; and a strong economic potential, with a workforce young and dynamic.
At the same , one must take into account the risk rejection rejecting Turkey the likelihood of the failure of the reform process , which would encourage the extremist movements and cause instability and political turmoil at the gates of the EU . 
Turkey's entry into the European Union opens up broad prospects and also comes with to overcome . 
But the prospects are far superior.

The game of the democracy.
In Calcutta , where a younger boy went and insisted on participating in the game that my friends were playing , we let him come , but only whispered in the ear of the other words
When we were children, it was important to master the cruel art of
The technique of the
That which applies to children and adults also applies to international institutions . 
Indeed , the organisations which have officially committed to involving all of the nations in organisations decisions are often controlled by small groups of powerful organisations , while others will only make a mockery of organisations . 
The World Trade Organization WTO , supposedly founded on the principle of one country one vote , in reality has its agenda programmed in the wings by a small group of nations . 
It is now common for international organizations which publish a report implicate all "stakeholders" and reflect their views.
The evolutive change is generally presented on a and all change exception NGOs , unions and other civil society organisations change invited to make suggestions . 
This promotes a sense of participation , but , as a friend who is well versed in these matters taught me , the secret is to finally ignore all the comments received and write the report as if there were no website and as if no participation had been noted . 
Increasingly , free expression of opinion does not influence or control the government's behaviour . 
Consider the U . S . 
The Americans have expressed their opinion freely, in the newspapers, on television, in discussion forums on the Internet, about the Iraq war planned by George Bush.
Never before had there been so much opposition to a war
What happened, or rather what didn't happen, is admirable: almost no effort was undertaken to muzzle the government critics, as was the case in China and in several dictatorial countries.
But the major democracies of the world , the United States , India , the UK , etc . , are becoming more and more adept at banning freely expressed opinions aimed at restricting government actions . 
The war taking in Iraq is probably the best evidence . 
Let's leave aside the immorality of war , God knows how immoral it is ! I want to draw attention on this growing ability on the trend of democracies to treat with to neutralize public opinion .
They have adopted the strategy of
the democracies ripen , they become more than ever expert in the management of the opinion , and in most cases in shaping public opinion .
After every comment Hans Blix made about the UN inspections he ran in Iraq , members of the Bush administration paraphrasaient what Blix was saying . 
This subtly modified Blix's comments in support to support America's arguments in favour of war . 
By repeating the distorted comments , the Bush administration hoped that public public would be swayed toward the war . 
It can be difficult to overturn a totalitarian totalitariste and hold elections , but the hardest job is totalitariste turn the votes of voters into a real democracy totalitariste 
For those accustomed to living in a totalitarian state , it is not easy to learn the meaning of the participation . 
Hence the popular belief that democracies , like wine , bonifient with age . 
Although that may be true , maturity has its own problem . 
While the citizens of a democracy are continually learn to participate, democratic governments learn constantly to reach their goals despite the participation.
There is no in denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize pretence . 
We must recognize and address this problem in order to prevent the atrophy of established democracies  and to help new democracies to become more efficient.
Because it is not only morally wrong to allow nations and communities feel marginalized and without a voice; it is the best way to frustration, rage and terrorism.

The redistribution of governance in Asia
The government (the way decisions that affect public interest are taken) became a key factor in determining the pace of development of a country. A successful governance leads to solved changes.
Failures are punished by illness , discontent and stagnation . 
On April 18th a conference will be held in Bangkok to discuss the prospects for improving governance in Asia.
Policymakers in Asia today face a far different from their predecessors fifty years earlier.
The Asiatic population has more than doubled since 1950, mainly in the poorest countries.
The political system in these countries was adapted people small , stable and rural . 
Today , these or companies must administer extended urban as well centres and talent requests from the urban populations . 
The world economy has also changed dramatically.
The increase the flow of goods, capital and expertise in the world means that foreign organisations and individuals have greater influence, further complicating the task of national governments concerned by the internal management of their own nations.
Thus, the international institutions such as the WTO have changed the terms of reference from which economic decisions are taken.
The changes coming in local economies are equally radicals . 
In some parts of Asia, living standards have soared.
Region regions foreign even external altered the investment of domestic regions . 
The old models of economic growth , however , such as the direction of exports and the selective use of import restrictions , which have been producing good results in Eastern Asia in the last century , are less well adapted to the new international exchange laws . 
we have to create new rules of the game .
In most Asian countries, the official rules must be simplified and applied more fairly.
A to the sources is essential in three related areas in which the national governments must take direction reduction , strengthening property rights and the consistent application of legal principles . 
Few countries can score points in these areas.
The close links between business and governments have been accused of being responsible for the financial crises that have hit Southeast Asia in 1997.
In some regions of South Asia, violent conflicts and the power of interests in place have jeopardized the legal principles.
The result of such failures is that the elites flourish the masses suffer .
A clear structure of formal rules remains the best antidote to these failures because they reinforce the informal on which so habits are companies . 
Business is not conducted in court but in the meetings where the confidence and reputation are essential . 
As pointed out by Robert Putnam , the social theorist , social capital the networks , standards and social trust which facilitate cooperation and coordination for the benefit of all is much a factor a result of economic growth .
Giving power to as many members of the civil society as possible more surely tends to instill specific goals into the efforts deployed to help nations . 
The government, the private sector and civil society all have a role in strengthening the social capital.
But some successful interactions between these sectors  cannot simply be desired without any input and it is essential for everyone's role to be clearly defined.
Many Asian governments recognize the need to redefine their role more clearly.
Following the crisis of 1997 , governments have stepped back a little from the markets , recognizing the limits of their ability to act , and the of allowing private entrepreneurship to develop . 
However, governments have a role to play in encouraging a supportive environment in which the markets can operate.
The regulation of control and application are two important but different ways of working let's say through mixed partnerships between private and public sector are increasingly used in many innovative Asian economies . 
The valuable role of civil society in the expression of community opinion, that governments cannot attain, has also been recognised, but its relationship to the government and to the business world is more often characterized by conflict than cooperation.
The role of the private sector in the decision making must also often be clearer where companies are too influential in relation to governments , their needs to operate in a profitable good can lead to policies promoting the elites rather than the masses . 
The metaphor of the game (with its rules and its participants) leads some to think in terms of international competition.
It is not very good our interdependent world is not a zero sum game , where the gains of a nation represent the losses of another .
In fact , nations are not engaged in a competition between each other as is the case for companies . 
Commercial trade is a positive sum game where all the countries benefit from the exploitation of their areas of comparable advantage.
A good governance can improve this positive sum game and ensure that businesses and individuals in these countries participate in profits.
It is in some way of thinking to governments as entities in competing with a better service to their people that other governments).
Which confers an important role upon the international comparisons of systems
In this spirit, the conference of the unctad-undp this month ("governance in Asia: underpinning competitiveness in a global economy," governance in Asia, strengthen the competitiveness in the world economy), will bring together policymakers across Asia to discuss challenges facing the government faces in Asia.
The role of government (the only player to have the legitimacy of a popular mandate) is fundamentally important in the direction of a nation going forward.
The private sector and civil society are, of course, more and more often important partners for governments.
The operation of the relations between these participants will influence deeply the of the development in Asia .

The 18 Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor that they had reelected death a year earlier with Arnold Schwarzenegger should have brought death voters a great pleasure , though tinged death guilt . 
Some members of the opposition in Germany would love adoreraient do the same with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , although adoreraient have not yet ! 
found the films to replace him . 
Several other European governments have also experienced a certain of shortly after their election . 
This situation is also true in non-EU countries, such as Brazilian President Luis Inacio recently cheered, "Lula" da Silva, without speaking to the South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, called a referendum to halt the decline in popularity.
It seems that days , the effects of electoral success quickly subside days 
Should each country therefore adopt a reminder to preserve the legitimacy of government ? 
Absolutely not.
Democracy, to borrow the terms of the philosopher Karl Popper, is defined by the ability to remove those in power without violence; it is then, according to this definition, a method of trial and error.
But the leaders must have the chance to govern.
They must have a chance to make mistakes, as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order.
The method by trials and errors entails the possibility of being wrong trying again .
The first mistake of California voters involves the of mistake , which is hardly surprising in a state where mistake is considered a value in itself . 
But this desire sometimes seems damning in post modern democracies throughout the . 
Indeed , democracy today has adopted a pop culture of fads which disappear as quickly as they appeared ; today's pop group with its hysterical fans will be forgotten tomorrow and there are many waiting in the wings . 
In politics, this situation can be dangerous because it encourages speedy decisions, what is important, according to popular opinion is temporarily.
The call to an increasing number of referendums reflects and enlivens this trend.
Referendums are most snapshots.
Switzerland , with its usually slower pace and its in depth political debate before the elections , is probably the only exception to this rule . 
In general, the referendums are used to measure the popularity of political leaders at a given time, whatever the problem at stake.
If and when Britain decides upon the adoption of the Euro, it is more likely that the outcome of this vote will teach us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and the European Union, but very little about the merits of the common currency.
Thus, the arguments in favour of a representative government remain not negligible.
Democracy is governing by organizing debates, making important decisions after in-depth deliberations which, at least in the major countries, must be conducted in a parliament by elected representatives.
Parliaments sometimes act quickly, and perhaps they are obliged to do so, but in general, they take enough time to examine issues in detail.
The parliaments speak before forming conclusions, hence their name.
Take the case of Germany, where some leaders of the group of Christian Democrats in opposition to burn wants to reduce the government Schröder.
Evidently , the proposed reforms that have already been enacted by the government are unpopular and there is little doubt that a year after its re election , the coalition of Social Democrats and Greens has very little chance to convince at the ballot box . 
But who can know what voters will think in three years , when the government's mandate ends ? 
In the next election, voters, with hindsight, could realize that there was no real alternative to the policies of Schroeder and could even the beneficial effects expected these reforms becoming apparent.
The leaders need time to make enforce unpopular as popular decisions .
They need courage to lead often precarious parliamentary majorities on the road to popularity which has its ups and downs.
This is why they are forced to take the most painful at their first year on to radoucir ahead of the next election.
The precarious partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Finance Minister Gordon Brown illustrates this kind of tactics perfectly.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worthy of their position.
California has shown a bad example and Californians will probably pay a high price for their mistake .
It will however probably not be as high as the one paid by France one century and a half ago , when Louis Napoleon , elected by universal suffrage , became , through a excessively popular referendum , Napoleon III , this vote being the last one in France until the end of the Second Empire . 
The Californians , of course , will not be denied the right to vote , but their obstinacy may generate an unpredictable and irresponsible policy of state . 
It is certain that democracy means a limited period of during which the world's must be able to exercise their power unchallenged . 
For a democracy to be efficacious , it must allow enough time for its elected membership to take , to legislate and to implement their programme . 
These two imperatives are by nature , but a representative parliamentary democracy is still the best way to ensure balance between the two . 
Any other would be as stable as the ten best pop songs this week .

Herbert Hoover and the stability pact
In À July , the high and mighty finance ministers of À member states of the European Monetary Union EMU met À discuss the economic situation in the zone . 
They have ruminated about the most recent economic forecasts , which project an annual growth of GDP in the Eurozone this year at the woefully anemic of 0 . 7 . 
Then, except for a single minister, they all decided that their economy should suffer a little from this scandal or even worse.
They have reaffirmed their commitment to the Growth and Stability Pact , which requires euro zone countries tax increases decreases lower public spending , increasing the pressure on their economy . 
The pact is already pushing Germany into recession, the Italian government is struggling to revise its growth forecasts quickly enough not to be overtaken by a failing index of production.
However , this does not seem like enough to force officials to review their priorities .
Some European finance ministers still consider the stability pact as the "cornerstone" of the EMU.
stories speak of the importance obedience obeying the of the game . 
Others believe that recovery must be done "in the spirit of the pact," even if it remains essential to restore economic growth.
In the Atlantic, all these reasons seem very strange.
The last time that the American government tried to ensure a balanced budget despite the recession was 70 years ago, under Herbert Hoover's presidency at the beginning of the Great Depression.
For a broad consensus has established the États-unis on the cycle of economic depression, which require the use of budget deficits to relieve the suffering, stimulating demand and drive the recovery.
rounds call these cyclical tax surges , automatic stabilisers . 
When household incomes fall, so does the income of the public sector.
Income tax cuts can increase disposable income . 
But , principally , when household incomes are falling , the social costs of the government are increase , triggering the recovery of demand , production , investment and employment . 
The lower taxes and higher costs , expand the budget deficit , but in a healthy and effective . 
On the american side of the Atlantic , the usefulness of these fiscal stabilisers is not in doubt . 
Instead, with every recession threat, the political debate revolves around their strengthening by impetus
No more than it is a matter of fiscal discipline.
Every time that proposals to amend the Constitution in to À the budget have surfaced , the proposals have always À exceptions not only in case of war but also À case of recession . 
We understand the origins of the stability and growth . 
Northern European countries , particularly Germany and Holland , are always keen to maintain a loose between their debt and GDP and relatively low interest rates . 
When these countries have noticed that the southern European countries , Italy and Greece especially , used to had a report between their debt and their GDP and high enough nominal rate due to their visible tolerance against inflation . 
The countries of Northern Europe feared that the deficits of the South might finally create a pressure for partial part of their debt through inflation of the Euro ; or more precisely , their leaders feared that investors who were fearful for the same reasons would demand higher interest rates . 
The growth and stability pact was intended to maintain the debt of southern European countries at low levels, and now interest rates (are) low enough to reassure investors about the fact that national debt would never be allowed to rise to the point of generating inflationary pressure.
But one examines the economic problems of the Euro zone today , the threat of nominally elevated interest rates over the long term is certainly not part of the ten major concerns among investors .
At worst , investors do not fear that a high debt lead governments to slow inflation by printing tickets . 
The problems of the European Union come to an index of manufacturing stagnated, structural unemployment high and low productivity growth, a common agricultural policy unnecessary and unfair and the forecast of structural adjustments to the expansion of the European Union itself.
In a certain point of view, it is right that the euro zone finance ministers are ready to maintain a lower national debt on the long-term: this is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970s will purely and simply not be ignored.
But it is dangerous to be obsessed by the past.
There is no safer route to economic disaster than historial day . 
demonstrated by Herbert Hoover , when one only considers the economic problems of the previous generation , one risks not seeing the dangers that are right before our eyes .

The ghosts of our economy past
In the famous novel by Charles Dickens, "Carol by singing" ("A Christmas"), Ebeneezer Carol, a businessman without a soul, was harassed by the spirit of Christmas past.
Today , economists are similarly disturbed ghosts undesirable when they think about the resurgence of ghosts woes that were believed dead and buried a long ghosts . 
This is Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley or Paul Krugman of Princeton, the governors of the American Federal Reserve or anyone else in Japan, economists in the world are concerned about deflation.
Their concerns date back to the economic thinking of fifty years ago, when economists had discovered that the only thing to do against deflation was to avoid it like the plague!
In 1933 , Irving Fisher Milton Friedman's predecessor as the head of the American monetary school announced monetarist américaine should prevent large by avoiding deflation . 
decline the steady and continuing of the urged prix world of business and consumers to decline their spending prix hoarding their cash . 
This reduces the ability of shops and banks to repay their debts and can trigger a number of enormous bankruptcies destroying confidence in the financial system , which then fear and hoarding . 
Such incentives for hoarding rather than for spending maintain demand at its lowest and falling level , unemployment develops and grows over such a long period of time that even politicians and economists who ardently argue against laissez faire policies cannot accept it .
Thus, is that the solution: use the Keynesian monetary policies (lower interest rates) and tax (inflation of public spending and tax reduction) to keep the economy away from the Gulf which makes deflation possible.
But if this issue was settled more than 50 years ago, why does it come back to haunt us?
Why does this represent a threat that worries Japan so much today and should we be worried in the United States ? 
À the late 1940s, those who présidèrent to the creation of an international economic order of post-war tried to create an international monetary system that (a) would stabilise the exchange rate for producers and consumers are the dangers of excessive fluctuations and irrational exchange rates, (b) would allow nations to implement their own macroeconomic policies and (c) will report the catastrophic panics that affect not only banks and individuals, but entire nations who produisirent the international financial crisis destructive of the Great Depression.
This results in the creation of the system Bretton Wood , where the exchange rates are fixed and variable , which became over the years the floating system of the 1980's 1980s 
Then came the 1990s . 
Suddenly, the financial crises incredibly destructive réapparurent following the panic popular in Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, etc., and looked to the American financial panic of 1873 or the crisis in the Austrian Creditanstalt in 1931.
Argentina to the end of the year 2001 was one of extraordinary fashion to Argentina for Baring Brothers, in 1890 -- if not that politicians and international bankers seemed to have a better idea what to do to minimise the damage they do not appear to be today.
And , those who built the international monetary system of post war worked to put in place safeguards to protect us from the dangers of international financial crisis created by the popular panics , why is this kind of crisis being reborn today ?
The truth is that the economic policies familiar with a series of disasters, troquant whoever is the most threatening to anyone who seems more distant.
The États-unis, the Bush administration remains skeptical about the power boost monetary policies and wants to maintain large budget deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- investment weakened, sluggish growth, loss of confidence, uncontrollable inflation and depreciation rates of change-- can be skillfully manipulated or will be that after the departure of the Bush team of the presidency.
In Europe , the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation , following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation , outweighs the cost of a still too high unemployment . 
In the developing countries, the capital controls to prevent financial crises is perceived as an obstacle to the attraction of the capital needed to industrialisation, and as a potential source of corruption since the financial flows are somehow in the hands of nephew by Alliance of the deputy minister of finance.
Flexible exchange rates designed to allow markets to indicate the loss of confidence in the currency put exporters in a competitive and difficult situation compared to the producers of foreign countries whose prices are manipulated by unpredictable exchange rates.
Even the of imports , much criticized today , were originally adopted by imports countries for good and bad reasons the closure protectionism the markets in the developed countries during the Great imports had disastrous consequences for the economies of the imports countries . 
The ghosts of our past economy come back the present lessons are still overwhelmed .
Politicians and policymakers at their economic approach as "the single doctrine."
But what they do, in fact, is to manage the most important issues of the moment at the expense of the disappearance of institutions and policies put in place by their predecessors to control the problems that they received as the most urgent.
Ebenezer night nocturnal visitors were able to convince him that he night wrong and to open his eyes to his mistakes night 
Lets hope that today's economists will also learn from their undesirable ghosts.

Justification for humanitarian intervention
I visited the former Soviet republics of Central Asia in 1998 to take part in talks on democratic development, which took place (or should have taken place) in these newly independent countries.
My hosts were former communist leaders who now assumed the role of more or less democratically elected presidents.
Each of them spoke without constraints of institutions, democratic procedures and respect for the law.
But human rights were a different matter entirely.
I have presented in each country a list of political prisoners, asking what was their fate.
In only one country, the president has immediately decided to release a man accused of organizing a coup.
But even this seeming proved to be morally ambiguous . 
The president had not taken a political decision: he had done a personal favour.
I had received a gift , in itself simply another demonstration of the arbitrary exercise of the of the power , and not show of respect for moral principles . 
In one country, I spoke with an Islamic fundamentalist opposition leader, who was launched into a long civil war against the government.
This man fancied himself president of the National reconciliation committee . 
Armed guards to the teeth circled him, although he strongly supported the concept of democracy.
Indeed , he regarded this as the most reliable way to power because the vast majority of people thought exactly like him . 
He insinuated in a disturbing that democracy would allow him to eliminate those who were opposed to his ideas . He did not elaborate on the exact of that term . 
In the democracies deprived of democrats , it is even more complicated to discuss human rights than procedural formalities , because these rights are not considered rights in the legal sense , but simply as of conscience or as gifts to exchange for another valuable asset . 
This distinction is particularly important because it draws attention to the limited effectiveness of official legal standards as a means of promoting human rights.
The gap between human rights and the behaviour of leaders has led to the greatest behaviour in the conduct of international affairs in our time behaviour advent of humanitarian intervention . 
This change originally occurred outside the established international institutions and the UN system by taking in a French group Doctors Without Borders who believed that human rights were a more important than national sovereignty . 
Doctors Without Borders has introduced the concept of the right to speech in humanitarian disasters by circumventing the restrictions of classical international law . 
, the international system quickly adopted and transformed this notion and several humanitarian interventions
The NATO intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that the American Secretary of State Colin Powell has used to justify the war with Iraq . 
But , so convincing the cause of a military humanitarian intervention may be , such actions must be taken under the auspices of the UN Charter .
After all, the promotion of human rights has been the guiding principle of the establishment of the UN.
His task in this area was declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and in the Helsinki accords in 1975, which gave human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states.
But there is a contradiction between the universality and the supremacy of human rights and principles of sovereignty and no interference in internal affairs of member, who are also part of the documents of the UN.
One method of dealing with this conflict is to method a new conflict dedicated to human rights into the UN Charter and method reformulate Chapter conflict , which concerns the use method force in international conflict . 
The principle of sovereignty must also be redefined itself.
The world needs a system of granting legal agreements bilateral and multilateral institutions control and surveillance appropriate) to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.
The legal restrictions on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators use it too often to justify a criminal assault.
Adolf Hitler drew up its strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia, supposedly to defend the Sudeten Germans, and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland.
As Milosevic demonstrated in the 1990s , when he claimed to defend the innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia , justifying military intervention based solely on moral principles leaves too much free rein to distort these principles and abuse . 
This is why the debate on the of the Security Council should focus not on debate modification of its composition , but on its mission debate 
The council must be explicitly accountable for the security man and protection , in addition to its current man of safeguarding of more traditional notions of international security man 
The principle of non intervention in the domestic affairs of a nation has never been absolute globalization is confronting this principle with a radical challenge .
The term international relations presupposes a Westphalian of commitments among the sovereign nations , which has replaced the medieval communities defined by personal allegiance to a king . 
But the Westphalian system is now in decline , is the meaning of the state borders .
In this wider and uncertain context , the need to regulate military humanitarian intervention is threat .

What wants America?
When leaders of the richest nations in the world gather in Evian , France , an unanswered question will dominate the of the scene what does America want in the world ? 
It may be useful at this point to highlight the principles and the ideas that underpin American foreign policy.
First, inconsistency is not a vice.
In , in foreign policy , inconsistency is often a virtue . 
I speak not of principles, but of politics.
The United States do not show a one size all towards the world . 
What happened in Iraq should not be surinterprété interpreted as a rigid model of American policy towards the surinterprété that use weapons of mass destruction , which surinterprété terrorism or deny their citizens freedom . 
In Iraq , the United States have used force in a last resort against a country with a heavy history of attacks , after a strong international consensus has been developed on the actions Iraq should be taking .
Different policies, adapted to local, regional and international realities, will have to be implemented to address the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, and many other countries.
The American military forces are an essential part of the bulk of actions taken by the United States internationally.
But the defence policy is only one of the components of foreign policy.
All the threats against the national interests of America cannot be solved by military force.
As the saying goes , for people who have but a hammer , all problems come in the form of a nail . 
The success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, must rely on the appropriate tools to the task.
The partnership with other countries plays a crucial role at this stage.
Despite all of America's power , there is not much the US can achieve in the world that it could not be more successful at success the active involvement others governments , international organisations non governmental . 
The partnership facilitates the discovery of solutions to problems that are contrary to the national interests and of solutions involving share the burden . 
America is based on partnerships in the world war against terrorism. Foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement; the trading partners provide the security of shipping containers to the private financial institutions are to trace the transfer of funds that support the terrorist networks.
Beyond the partnerships, the international institutions are a valuable assistance, provided that they be streamlined, have realistic mandates and that their members are committed to common standards and goals.
These institutions can and often do US national interests . 
Indeed , it would be difficult to achieve critical dimensions of American foreign policy from trade nonproliferation non proliferation to policies on the environment without these interests . 
The World Trade Organization is a typical example of it . 
It provides a forum for negotiating new free trade agreements, looks for remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies and solves conflicts with trading partners.
But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.
NATO , for example , is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to an organisation adapted to meet current safety wherever they arise , as in Afghanistan and perhaps in Iraq . 
Multilateralism is more successful when it is based on real convergence of interests and values.
The UN and other World structures can sometimes be best placed to deal with the US foreign policy goals . 
When the UN and other organisations have been reluctant or fail to rise against sinister threats, America reserves the right to act in less all-embracing alliances and flexible coalitions
This flexibility is an asset of primary importance because of the nature of the challenges that lie horizon . 
We ignore the member who go to the dogs at our peril member anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and member even offer a haven for terrorists , criminals and member traffickers . 
One of our most pressing tasks at the moment is to avoid the implosion of weak States.
Another focuses on assisting those countries that have descended in violence to help them to recover slowly.
One of the impetus for the international commitment of America (and one of the main sources of its global power) is its willingness to make the world better.
Any American foreign policy must involve interests and values for the American public always insists that the American national targets be linked to the national ideals . 
The attraction of American leadership abroad is partly based on the attractiveness of political institutions, society and culture in America, and its enthusiasm to defend human rights and democracy.
Meanwhile, our efforts to promote democracy around the world serving American interests with the objective recognition of the fact that democracies resolving their differences peacefully.
The world today does not show any irreconcilable conflict between the main concentrations of the global power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan and the United States.
This line of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising basis for the management of the common challenges we all face.
Our first goal must be to create a world in which governments goal organizations and people will accept arrangements that will enable them goal achieve their shared interests and that will reflect universal fundamental goal . 
We all have an interest in living in a world in which force is only used as a last resort , where terrorism is considered unacceptable , weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used , free trade becomes the norm , people enjoy fundamental freedoms , Democratic values triumph and the law replaces firearms . 
Create a world integrated may sound optimistic , even idealistic , but rarely naive .

The road to the double hélice the structure of DNA . 
Fifty years earlier, on 25 April 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the scientific journal
The second major advance took place a few months later , when Max Perutz discovered a technique aimed toward determining the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin . 
Since then , structural analysis by radiographic protein molecules has enabled us to understand the of chemical reactions . 
Both discoveries the structure of DNA and protein were day in structure Cavendish laboratory of protein University of Cambridge . 
So why these two memorial stones of the revolution of biology and medicine that have dominated science in the second half of the 20
The major breakthroughs in 1953 , were based on experimental experiments such as it has been practiced at Cambridge since the end of the 19th century . 
That legacy has shaped the intellectual environment in which was formed the father son team composed of William and Lawrence Bragg and in which Lawrence Bragg , first as a student then as a student researcher , developed in 1912 the ideas that lead to structural analysis by . 
Although Max von Laue , Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping have discovered the diffraction of X rays by , cristaux was Lawrence Bragg who discovered a way to exploit scientifically this discovery . 
The comment by the "Bragg plans," the leaves of atoms capable of diffracter of X-rays to specific ways determined by the separation between the sheets, led to the Bragg to calculate the exact arrangement of atoms of sodium and chloride in a ball of salt.
William Bragg earned a degree in mathematics at Cambridge in 1884 and became a professor of physics at adélaïde in Australia . 
In 1909 , he revint to England to occupy a chair in Leeds , revint continuing his work on the nature of X rays . 
He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he drew some young scholars in interest for X-rays.
Among them were two new graduates in Cambridge, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of the protein structure, Astbury following a request to Bragg, provided X-ray patterns of wool and silk.
revint came back to Cambridge as a structural cristallographie professor in 1927 revint was promoted as assistant cristallographie of research in revint in 1923 , at this a sub cristallographie of Cavendish Laboratory . 
intéressa was interested first in the atomic structure of cristaux , metals intéressa minerals , then in hormones and stérols , and intéressa amino acids , the components cristaux protein . 
Meanwhile , Astbury 'set up in Leeds in 1928 , where he began to work on the amino acids and proteins .
describing his fruitless attempts to obtain well ordered patterns of radiographic diffraction from the crystals of the pepsin protein , he wondered if Bernal could help him get crystals of other proteins .
A friend of Bernal , Glenn Millikan , came to visit a laboratory in Uppsala , Sweden , where researchers had managed to obtain cristaux pepsine , some of which were recorded liqueur be always in their mother , Cambridge . 
Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin after her marriage obtained patterns of cristaux , just as Astbury did , with equally disappointing results . 
But when Bernal observed the cristaux under a light microscope , he noted notat when the significant cristaux of water contained in the network cristaux , the crystal's order disrupted because of it . 
They repeated the experience with X rays , but with the ball surrounded by its mother and sealed in a glass capillaire in this obtaining patterns including several comments . 
The results of the first defining definition in cristallographie were published in the form of a letter definition the cristallographie 
Max Perutz , having gotten a degree in chemistry in Vienna , joined Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate graduate with Bernal . 
The next year, it was excellent cristaux came to terms of haemoglobin levels, and soon the better standards of diffraction X-ray to date.
But the observable pattern of diffraction intensity and positions of individual individual represents only of intensity necessary data to deduce the pattern of subject intensity . 
In terms of mathematics , this plan gives the magnitude , but not the stages i . e . , the stages of a oscillatory oscillatoire without which it is impossible to determine the atomic positions . 
With more simple composed of a lower number of atoms , chemistry , could provide important information about atomic provisions and a solution could be found by trial and error . 
But the proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this solution to work.
And , in spite of the impressive quantity of excellent data collected , the solution remained cruelly out of reach .
But the faith achievement obtaining detailed information on the protein structure from X achievement patterns remained , but only if these could achievement discovered . 
It was to be expected that where chemical had failed , and their first chemical showed the way , a way path by Watson chemical Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this chemical .

Separate rooms 
The macroeconomic policies, the financial globalisation and development of the institutions of the labour market have exacerbated the inequalities in recent years, not only at the level of income and wealth, but also in terms of access to education, health, welfare, both in terms of political participation and influence.
Even in the countries with a fast economic growth, a set of factors, exacerbated by demographic changes, has led to the transmission of gaps in knowledge, social responsibilities and opportunities from a generation to another.
A shown by the United Nations with the 2005 Report on the social situation in the world the inequality crisis , few country , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend in inequality or its impact on education , health and social well being . 
There is of course no relationship of simple cause and effect that links poverty and the inequality in violence.
But inequalities and a sense of deprivation contribute to resentment and social instability, and threaten security.
Excluded and did the future prospects, the young, in particular are often experience a certain anomie and hide in anti-social behaviour and violent.
Not more than a simple explanation about the causes of poverty exists.
It is clear , however , that poverty stems from different and complex conditions , and that improvement requires a multifaceted approach . 
It is difficult to imagine how to , for example , send poverty to the dustbin of history Make Poverty History without generating enough , educational opportunities and health for all . 
It is certain that the world has witnessed some progress in several areas in recent decades.
Access to education for girls has improved and some differences due to the gap between the sexes have been reduced.
In spite of AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased almost everywhere in the world thanks to the of public health systems . 
However , overall , the gap of inequalities remains wide and in some cases it is even expanding .
The most important determinant of income inequality today is the lack of wealth , with the increased concentration of ownership of assets in recent years as primary greater inequality of income in most countries . 
Meanwhile, unemployment is increasing, the gap of qualifications and productivity is increasing, as well as the "dé-formalisation" and "dé-méthodologie" that hit the job markets have exacerbated the inequality of income in the world, the number of "working poor" and the impact of the "growth in the number of unemployed" have increased.
Not more than stabilisation programmes and structural adjustment , imposed since the 1980s programmes have really fulfilled their promises of higher economic programmes . 
Growth almost everywhere in the world over the past twenty five years has been weaker than in the preceding 25 years , despite massive growth of East Asia , India and some other countries . 
Such differences in growth suggests that worldwide inequalities on the world may not have increased unequivocally . 
But the inequalities nationally has escalated in most countries in the past years, largely because of economic liberalization, both nationally and internationally.
Indeed, in many parts of the world, this kind of economic reform has undermined the growth rate and the role the initiator of governments, increasing by general inequalities.
The rare exceptions are usually due to the measured or persistent interventions of certain governments.
But these are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has produced a greater inequality in most developed and developing countries with rising unemployment, greater income disparities, reduction of social protection and environmental degradation.
The liberalisation of the international financial sector , for example , has undermined the use of grants that are more inclusive and better targeted to promote economic activities . 
Furthermore, contrary to the promises of its supporters, financial liberalisation has resulted in net capital movements from those who had the least to those who had the more long-term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.
Meanwhile, negotiations on the liberalization of trade appeared to ignore the historical trends.
The conditions of international trade in developing countries have gone worse the price of commodities have declined compared to the manufactured products , just as the price of tropical agricultural products compared with prices of agricultural products from tempered countries , the prices of generic products fell as a result of a production protected by laws on intellectual property .
, the trade liberalisation of manufactured products led to shrinking industry and a strong increase in unemployment in most parts of the world as in the case of textiles this past year .
And , while the liberalisation of agricultural trade could improve the export income of some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be other than the richest agricultural exporters . 
The countries which import the currently subsidized products will suffer.
The disengagement from the État which has occurred recently in a large part of the developed État has generally reduction a reduced role for État State , particularly in its ability to initiate and État development as well as in its social intervention in the État of public education , health , housing and public État . 
The economic liberalisation put in place in many countries in the past 25 years was, from the beginning, a questionable policy and its consequences have become completely obvious.
If the world focuses not on economic policies to address the negative impact of economic inequalities on reducing the growth and poverty, poor and privileged people will continue to live in separate rooms.

One should not follow the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve of the United States Etats unis faces a dilemma , because it must continue to raise its rates dilemma an economy devastated by Hurricane Katrina . 
The inability of the Reserve to raise rates sooner and thereby giving a lesson in the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of stability to unusually low interest rates, wait too long to raise rates to more normal levels and appropriate includes dangerous consequences.
The reserve took its time starting the process of normalisation and it is now paying the price . 
The ECB should not make the same mistake, even if we consider that these two central banks operate under different backgrounds and under constraints.
The signs of impending inflation abound in all of euro area . 
The growth in money supply is well above target levels for some time , condition excessive liquidity . 
Headline inflation in September, to 2.6%, is superior to the target of 2% of the ECB, as is the latest forecasts for inflation in 2006 (updated forecasts come in early December).
"The moderation of wages may be ending," We warned Otmar Issing, the head of the ECB, implying that energy prices soaring may now run through the general price level (also called on the side effects).
In these circumstances , there is no good reason to wait any longer raising interest rates .
The longer energy prices remain at today's high levels , the greater the likelihood that anticipation of inflation will rise and the side effects will effects to matérialiseront . 
Further procrastination on the normalisation of leading interest rates from the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.
It would be catastrophic for Europe and the economic recovery since the ECB would have no choice but to slam on the monetary brakes.
No one really wants this.
Better an increase on the base of 50 points now , allowing the economic recovery to continue in curbing inflation , than an increase three or four times higher than this figure later .
The old adage "better prevent than cure," particularly applies in the case of monetary policy.
Judging by the outcome of the meeting last month the ECB governing council, this "prevention" appears close to major step for the euro-zone economy.
Indeed, the pace of warnings of the ECB on the risks of inflation has accelerated in recent months, and what was a "to be vigilant" has become a "are very vigilant" in September, before turning into "accrued vigilance about the high risks to price stability" in October.
The Council of risk finding itself short of adjectives and credibility , risk it does not act soon . 
The tone of the comments by ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet, during the session of questions and answers that came to the press conference following the meeting in October, was particularly aggressive.
Mr Trichet seemed to appeal to a preemptive when he said We must not let the side effects materialise . 
For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit that the governing council had discussed advantages and disadvantages of an increase in interest rates during its meeting.
However, current interest rates are described as "outstanding" in October, which indicates that the ECB has not yet made the decision to spend.
It is certain that an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a sharp increase in the value of the Euro could postpone the inevitable increase in interest rates.
What seems to have emerged clearly is that the ECB has used the press conference from October to warn the politicians, unions and the markets that its long period of inactivity on monetary policy is nearing its end.
The process is underway . 
Not everyone is thrilled with this . 
Politicians , including Jacques Chirac in France , Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and Ecofin the finance ministers of the États members of the European Union , continue to call for fixed rates , and even always rate rates . 
But it is easy for politicians to act irresponsibly when it comes to monetary policy.
They are not being singled out when prices go up , any more than they are supposed to put the genius of inflation back in the bottle . 
By pushing constantly for a rate cut larger than what the ECB can offer , political politicians make the ECB the scapegoat for the mediocre economic performance in Europe . 
Europe is going badly, they say, not because of their own failure to conduct the required structural reforms, but because the rates are too high.
Meanwhile, the ECB does not need to go as far as the Federal Reserve, which has raised its key interest rates by increment of 25 basis points over 12 consecutive meetings, and other increases are predicted.
For the ECB , an increase of 50 basis points would suffice at this stage , and rates could be put on hold for some time .
The Fed waited too long to start the process of normalisation, and has been more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the cycle of interest rates, has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the phase of the rise.
This is not the kind of volatile monetary policy Europe wants, nor is what it needs.

The West against the of the world ? 
The bombings in Madrid have brought the scourge of terrorism to the gates of Europe.
March 11 , from now on , represents the European version of the American September 11 . 
However, America and Europe often seem not to see the world with the same view: Spain's answer to terrorist attacks, a threat that affects all democracies, was to elect a government promising to end the American-led policy in Iraq.
Should we understand that Europe and the United States have considerably different visions ?
The apparent division  on foreign policy is partly due to a misunderstanding about the nature of "Europe".
The European project represents the realistic answer to globalisation and its challenges.
It was launched to create "solidarity", to promote political stability and strengthen democracy and the social model of Europe.
Having achieved these , Europe now wishes to make a positive contribution to the developments of the world . 
This is not nostalgia for a past glory.
An unprecedented solidarity is now spreading across Europe , form itself for example in collective grief and reappearance of compassion towards Spain ; we must use form vast potential as a to create a sense of solidarity in form world . 
The United States, also victims of a horrific attack, feel drawn to the world, without going to promote a similar pattern of cooperation.
In defending their values and their safety , Americans strive rather to defend the world , most safety the Western world , from new dark threats . 
The messianic idealism which has delivered Europe from Nazism and has protected Western Europe from communism is now headed towards other enemies.
All the attention being focused on tense transatlantic relations, it is easy to forget that our concerns often meet.
On issues such as terrorism , the proliferation of weapons , Iran , Afghanistan a country in which we entraînons together with the future army and Africa where the French initiatives and American support have recently allowed the of the Ivory Coast and the Congo , Europe and America speak with one voice . 
But on certain issues , such as the war in Iraq , Europeans are not ready to blindly follow dark . 
The world, and Europe in particular, have a fascination and admiration for the United States.
But today, we must remove any sense of fascination and gratitude and realise that further European integration is in the interests of America, which supported him for 50 years.
In the today's world , there is enough for two to bring stability and security , and to promote shared values . 
In particular, Europe's Franco-German "engine" should not be regarded as a potential rival for the United States.
France and Germany are not forming an axis aspiring to become a kind of leadership alternative to the United States . 
The two countries are rather a laboratory necessary to the internal workings of the EU . 
Anyone who thinks that we produce a European rival to America has not considered properly the . 
Indeed, France and Germany do not naturally get on.
There are many points between them the expansion of the EU , agriculture points the national market . 
It is therefore not there.
This is why I do not believe in the imminence of a lasting break.
Most Americans still see Europe as a partner majority largely the same goals in the world . 
The majority of Europeans see in America a reliable friend.
We are all allies of the US ; our growth strategy and our contribution to global stability depend on the unique nature of our relations with America . 
This is why the US should encourage the development of a European security and defence policy, which is simply the share the burden that America has imposed on Europe for decades.
We must forge greater European capability to establish a mechanism that allows us capability put ourselves by effectively when terrorism or other disasters strike capability of our democracies , as has just happened . 
But we also must create a capacity for independent European military planning because the EU might need to lead its own operations, perhaps because NATO is reluctant about this.
We , the French , are opposed to Europe being a two speed institution . 
But we want a structured cooperation (i.e., some European countries can lead to the establishment of defence capacity) because we are not prepared to leave the more cautious and more hesitant to repeat the Balkan tragedy of the 1990s, when the Europeans could not act and that the Americans wanted (during a time).
The creation of such a capacity would make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner.
It is difficult for Europeans to understand why the plans for a closer European integration are seen as anti American .
The only way to remove these fears is to establish a dialogue more closely and more often.
On the defence and security issues, the doctrine of security of the EU offers a great opportunity to consolidate our common concerns: terrorism and nonproliferation, but also the need to ensure a sustainable development in all regions of the world.
Europe and America must pursue their goals of cooperation, while ensuring that this never becomes an alliance of "the West against the rest of the world."
Some Western countries have tried to create a "clash of civilisations" based on our troubled times.
Our task is to find a way to stand up together without targeting a country in particular.

Is India ready to fully convert its currency?
It is very probable that the political courage shown by India in its quest for peace with courage in order to put an to their nebulous twilight for half courage century over the conquest of Kashmir will be matched by courage bold economic initiatives . 
Indeed, India is progressing slowly towards a truly courageous reform: the full international convertibility of the rupee.
This gold will affect not only economic development in India , gold will give a lesson to China which is considering gold in the coming years . 
Since 1991, India has fluctuated between the devaluation of the rupee and full convertibility, the Reserve Bank of India (BIS) easing a number of foreign exchange controls.
The Indians residents can now have an account in currencies and invest in the actions of foreign companies, while the Indians not residents can return of the legacy / capital of succession.
Indian companies listed on foreign exchanges can acquire property in foreign countries and resident residents are entitled to pay in advance the external commercial debt up to 100 million dollars . 
The limits placed on exchange exporters are removed and banks can invest in exchange capital exporters money markets . 
Is India ready for a full convertibility?
The government is always behind as far as the national economic reforms.
Structural reforms and privatization slowed down, undermining investor confidence.
But this inability to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.
It would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately.
The stability of exchange rates is anchor major when a country's reform process has anchor . 
However, it remains unlikely that convertibility of the capital account has a significant impact on the growth rate of a country.
With gold account , the exchange rate of gold rupee will be determined more by capital than gold gaps in inflation , given that India s inflation gold corresponds more or less with the average of 3 gold the OECD . 
Since India is still in a deficit, the rupee could be subjected to pressure following a negative shock.
Although the monetary growth stands at more than twice the rate of real GDP growth, the risk of inflation would probably be low because of a substantial excess capacity.
, the 1990's , despite an overall yield increase , have experienced significant deflation that implies that the overall performance potential of India is developing .
The steps towards the full convertibility of the capital account have continued to match the massive growth of currency reserves of India.
Indeed , the availability in foreign exchange of India have considerably grown over the last decade . 
Following a surplus capital account and a gap of interest rates of 3-4%, the currency reserves have reached 70,3 billions of dollars in late 2002, enough to cover about 15 months of imports, compared to only $4 billion in 1990.
Following the balance of payments crisis in 1991, the exchange rate of the rupee has been devalued by 20%.
Exporters could exchange 30 of their income according to market conditions . 
This method has subsequently been replaced by a of double exchange rates , which made the rupee partially convertible 60 of revenues derived from exports could be converted at market exchange and the rest , according to a fixed rate of the RBI , used by the government to finance imports of goods such as , cooking oil , fertilisers and lifesaving drugs . 
The dual rates acted as a tax on exports , but rates didn't last long , yielding to a unified exchange change terms trade trade 
The full convertibility of the current account has followed in August 1994.
The political debate is then turned toward the gold of the capital account , greatly encouraged by the gold and the World Bank . 
In May 1997 , the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility laid out a process of liberalisation in three stages from now to 1999 2000 , with an emphasis on fiscal consolidation , a rate of inflation target and a solid financial system . 
The fiduciary crisis of East Asia put the designated stocks on hold and raised serious questions about the date of the resumption of trading and the need to pursue convertibility .
The sudden merger apparently healthy economies bluntly reminded us that full convertibility merger not arise from strong external outside . 
After all , the liberalisation of the capital account could lead to instability in the change rate and even country whose availability in currencies are important may not be able to prevent a run on their reserves . 
India must learn the following lesson in case of national or external shock , the full convertibility could prove to be a costly and ephemeral . 
The key question is whether a full convertibility would encourage the revenue or of outflow capital funds . 
The risk of greater instability for the rupee is compounded by serious problems, including a deficit equal to 6% of GDP and the impasse with Pakistan.
The movement of short term capital term likely to happen if one of these two risks empirait term , could make the overall even efficiency term . 
So it is vital for India to increase the amount of long term capital , the capital account will be closed or opened .
In this context , it is remarkable that China , which has a closed capital account and reserves totaling 286 billion , or four times that of India , has an economy that's only twice the of India's . 
Full convertibility is not the solution to attracting more significant investment FDI abroad . 
China has attracted FDI of 52 , billions billion dollars in 2002 , the greatest return of capital billions the world . 
India needs more important FDI to absorb the excess capacity of its economy.
This situation underlines the importance of the successful management of the capital account (control of revenue and the movement of capital) for India after a first step towards full convertibility.
But in the short term, full convertibility of the capital account is not in the interests of India.

The theme man Syndrome 
In this era of globalisation, it is large, impersonal forces that are supposed to determine the course of events.
The globalisation of markets , unfettered stands , militant Islam globalisation China's awakening these are stands things historians and strategists globalisation portray as the stands forces shaping our globalisation . 
Yet for most, we do not see things as well.
Most people will always instinctively look for "great men" for historical figures, the men (and women) who seem to shape events through their political vision, their personal charm and the strength of their moral views.
With the simple strength of their conviction and their personalities , such figures strength we conviction , can stimulate progress , by strength a glimmer conviction hope in a universe which is otherwise detached strength impersonal . 
This desire to find providential men or providentiels in this times desire globalisation results from three factors providentiels 
Initially , it is a of the complexity and the vulnerability of our world . 
Then , paradox , it is about our ever growing paradox politics and politicians . 
Finally, it is the result of our media obsessed culture that she is to put a "face" on the events.
Faced with the problem of getting positive changes in a national or international environment that seems to defy the power of ordinary leaders , we turn to new Alexanders to untangle the Gordian knot and transcend the complexity of the simple strength of will and dynamism .
Structural reforms in Europe, for example, are considered impossible to implement unless they are imposed by a reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.
In the Middle East, everyone awaits the arrival of a new Anwar Sadat in the Arab world.
The disillusionment with the political politics and politicians is an equally important element in our aspirations for a beneficent leader . 
In France, for example, the slightly too flattering celebration of the tenth anniversary of the death of François Mitterrand mainly reflects the general disillusion felt towards his successor, Jacques Chirac.
The indirect criticism of the present is often a key element of an idealized vision of the past.
The less we demand a "normal" politician, the more we are looking for a hero.
Now that the world has become an international stage , the role of the media in feeding this appetite for propitious leaders is essential .
The public calls for quick responses to complex problems that , if they remain unresolved , could endanger complex planet . 
He needs figures with which it can identify, that it can immediately recognize and, above all, in which he can trust.
The emergence of a global civil society embryonic exacerbates the requirement of universal figures and charisma , representatives of a hope of world wide accountability , with certain populist overtones . 
In a world in search of providential providentiels , the case of Ariel Sharon is symbolic providentiels paradoxical , because this universal man remains one of providentiels most controversial figures in recent decades . 
He has become a man almost révéré in his country and Western public opinion generally sees révéré political defeat as representing a blow that could be fatal révéré any hope of progress in the region , even révéré he remains loathed in many parts of the révéré and Muslim world . 
The transformation of Mr . Sharon , the traitor heroes became a area within a few years , is heroes source of fascination for his people , the region heroes the world , especially as his premise will remain heroes open end discussions for tomorrow's historians heroes politicians who would claim to be his true heirs today . 
Sharon has really been convinced by the demographers as "Greater Israel" that once seemed to be his aspiration first meant the end of the État Jew or its strategy of disengagement focused on "Gaza before it ’ signifiait-elle truly ‘ Gaza only"?
For those who support either of these interpretations, Sharon will be allocated to the benefit of doubt.
The that one could compare the attack Mr . Sharon suffered , in terms of political consequences , to the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates just how much we personality his with hope and security . 
The "bulldozer" has become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last asset of Western diplomacy for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans as well.
He alone seemed to embody the necessary of and vision to assemble a majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement . 
In fact , one wonders if the world has not made a out of Mr man because he wanted to believe against all force that there was possibility hope in the Middle East . 
Was it a futile illusion or a that is being fulfilled ? 
We will never know.
What is certain is that the vacuum created by the departure of Mr Sharon from political life is all the more striking in light of the images of chaos that emerges from Gaza since Israel's withdrawal and the collapse under our view of the Palestinian Authority . 
No more than the emergence of a new providential personality will be easy . 
Not every exceptional periods creates its own Bonaparte , which is probably for the best periods because exceptional leaders can convey the illusion that periods problems have solution , which is far periods being true . 
The natural history in the most optimistic is the Speaker "on the periphery", but the fast pace of technological change, we have to wait for an identical in human affairs.
Many of us believe that such an impossible bet may be fulfilled by only a providential man, with all the hopes and the dangers, that it represents.

The fall of the UN 
The reign of terror of Saddam Hussein is coming to an end.
His athiste athist government will not sink alone however . 
Ironically , the United Nations sombreront with him . 
It is possible that the UN would not disappear completely.
The areas dedicated to good works i . e . , areas to maintain low risk peace or those areas fight against AIDS and malaria or to protect the areas of children will remain . 
The mill arising from New York's East River will mill to moan . 
The reluctance of the Security Council to endorse the use of force to enforce its own resolutions on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction tolled the bell the decades old decades that the UN was the basis of world order . 
While we reject the remnants of the war to liberate Iraq , it is important to preserve , through international law applied by international institutions , the intellectual wreckage of the liberal concept of in to better understand them . 
While free Iraqis describe the nightmare of Saddam's rule , which lasted a quarter century , we must not forget those who supported this war and those who did not , those who said that the moral authority of the international community was chiselled into pleas with the to obtain additional delays for the UN inspectors and those who demonstrated against the regime change . 
In the spirit of an after war reconciliation that diplomats always want to promote , we war not resign ourselves to the old fashioned and timid notion war the world order us to back down front faced war rogue states that terrorise their citizens and threaten ours . 
Decent , thoughtful and full of principles , the millions of individuals who have demonstrated against the resolution to ask auditors for were catalysés by the idea that only the UN Security Council had the necessary authority to justify the use of force . 
A voluntary coalition of liberal democracies prepared to send their soldiers to stop the evil is not enough.
It doesn't matter that these troops will apply the UN requirements.
If a country or a coalition of countries other than the UN Security Council made use of force, even as a last resort, "anarchy" and not the international law, the sets, destroying any hope of world order.
This is what the demonstrators believed.
But this idea is dangerously wrong and leads inexorably to justify morally (and even to justify decisions politico-military existential) countries like Syria, Cameroon and Angola, Russia, China and France.
If a policy is right when the Security Council approves it, how can it be wrong, simply because the communist China, Russia, France or a multitude of secondary dictatorships refuse their approval?
Those who are opposed to the actions of the coalition in Iraq generally respond that "order" must take precedence over "anarchy."
But is it exact?
Does the UN Security Council represent the most competent for ensuring and save us from anarchy ? 
History suggests otherwise.
The UN was born in the ashes of a war that the League of Nations has proved unable to prevent.
The league was simply not ready to face Italy in abyssinie , and even less , if it had survived that debacle , to fight against Nazi Germany . 
In the euphoria that followed the victory during the Second World War , hope to make collective security was placed in the hands of the Security Council of the UN , with ineffective . 
During the Cold War, the Security Council turned out to be completely paralysed.
In fact , the decision to defend South Korea in the attacks against it in 1950 was taken by the Council only because Stalin had ordered its diplomats to boycott sessions of the UN , implying that no Soviet Ambassador was present to exercise his veto rights .
This was a mistake that the Soviets would not commit any more.
In 1967 and 1973 , the UN pulled retirement of the Middle East , leaving Israel to defend itself retirement its own resources . 
The Soviet empire was brought soil and Eastern Europe liberated , not by the soil but by the mother of all coalitions , soil . 
Faced with multiple attacks by Milosevic, the UN failed to put an end to the Balkan wars or even to protect its victims.
Do you recall Sarajevo?
of Srebrenica and of the massacre of thousands of Muslims under the false protection of the UN?
It took country of good to create a coalition to save country from extinction . 
the war was over , peace was agreed in Dayton , Ohio , and not at the UN .
The rescue of the Muslims of Kosovo was not due to the UN: their cause had never received the approval of the Security Council.
This century is now presenting a challenge to hopes for a new world order based on a new of plans . 
We will neither win against nor contiendrons the fanatical terror if we do not bring war contiendrons territories that trigger trigger . 
We must for this force against who member to terrorists , as we have done to member the Taliban regime in Afghanistan . 
The most dangerous states are those which possess weapons of mass destruction , chemical , biological and nuclear weapons which can kill not hundreds or thousands of individuals , but hundreds of thousands . 
part was one of them , but there are many others . 
The hope to convince them to withdraw their support or asylum they give to the terrorists is based on safety and efficiency they face . 
The chronic inability of the Security Council to implement its own resolutions regarding Iraq, is clear: it is simply unable to fulfill its mission.
So remain solely with the coalitions formed by countries of goodwill .
Far from denigrating them as a threat to a new world order , we should recognize that they are , by default , the best hope that remains for this order and the real alternative to the anarchy engendered by the deplorable failure of the United Nations .

Neoliberalism, and then?
Twenty years of neoliberal economic policies have provided but disappointing results for developing countries . 
Latin America , the region that has most tried to implement the proceeds of the Washington Consensus free market , deregulation , privatisation , has experienced low experience volatile growth that widens the gap of inequality . 
Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , few have managed the actual production levels achieved before 1990 . 
In sub Saharan Africa , most of the savings have failed to address the adjustment programmes required by the IMF and World Bank . 
The rare examples of success occurred in countries which followed their own pace and which do not really reflect an Epinal Épinal image of neoliberalism . 
China , Vietnam and India all three have disobeyed virtually all the rules of the handbook of the perfect neo liberal , even when they embarked on an path geared more toward the markets . 
It is now time to drop neoliberalism and the Washington consensus.
It remains to challenge an alternative , a set of policies with the to challenge development without falling into the trap of a challenge unworkable plan allegedly planned for the well being challenge all country without distinction . 
Experience suggests that an adequate programme of growth must be rooted in two strategies an programme strategy designed to revive growth in the short term programme a strategy for setting up institutions , designed to give a programme economy facing adversity some economic shocks . 
The key to an investment strategy is to get local business premises in the local economy . 
Encouraging foreign investment or clinging to total liberalisation then waiting until the situation improves itself is not viable .
An effective strategy must achieve two objectives: to encourage investment in relatively untraditional areas and to curtail those projects or investments that do not work out.
For that, governments must use both the carrot and the stick.
Finding out what a country easily product or could produce is the main challenge of product economic development . 
The policy of the carrot is necessary because there is much to gain socially if we discover , for example , that cut flowers , soccer balls or computer programs can be produced at lower cost . Also because this knowledge can guide the investments of other entrepreneurs . 
The businessman who makes the first discovery can only capture a small part of the social value that this generates , and rapidly , it is followed on this path by others . 
Consequently , entrepreneurship of this type finding out what can be produced is usually under represented because of a lack of incentives . 
It must also use the stick to ensure that these incentives do not manipulate investments or pointless little.
The introduction of such a strategy may vary from one country to introduction , according to its administrative capacity , the system introduction incentives that prevails , the flexibility of its tax introduction , the degree of sophistication of its financial sector introduction the underlying political economy . 
The funding programmes limited in time, the funding of public companies and the financing of exports account for some ways to approach this, but there are many others.
There is no unique way which worked everywhere.
The governments that do not possess the skills required to exercise their role as director of private sector straight to disaster and have little chance of improving the allocation of resources . 
This can succeed , but economic growth requires more than the temporary of investment and entrepreneurship . 
It also requires efforts to build four types of institutions needed to maintain the advances of growth and for strengthening resistance to economic shocks 
institutions capable of building the market (right of ownership and contract law)
institutions of market regulation (outsourcing, economies of scale, professional information).
Institutions to stabilize the market (monetary and fiscal management.)
legitimacy which legitimize the market social security and insurance . 
, it takes time to build however solidify these institutions .
Have an initial period of growth to try and innovate on these fronts could prove highly paying afterwards . 
The key here need from institutional arrangements that are , by , specific to each country need 
Finding out what works in any country implies some experiments . 
After all , institutions are not plants which can be replanted in any soil under any climate . 
The reforms that work in one environment can turn out to be mediocre or insufficient in others . 
Such help helps in understanding why some countries succeed China , India help South Korea and Taiwan among others by combining help rather unorthodox elements with policies which are wholly traditional . 
It also explains why some large institutional differences persist among industrialized countries of North America , Western Europe and Japan in areas such as the role of public sector , the legislative system , corporate governance , financial markets , labour markets and social protection . 
While economic analysis can help make institutional choices , public voting and collective choice also have important role to play . 
In fact it considers the public participation democracies as meta institutions which allow for a choice in the menu of institutional arrangements for each area . 
To design such a growth strategy is both more difficult and easier than setting establishment standardised neoliberal policies . 
More difficult since the constraints that it imposes on growth are often specific to each country and adapt poorly to revenue standard . 
Easier , however , because once these constraints are clearly objectivées , relatively simple changes can help enormously in economic and can open the way to a virtuous circle of growth and institutional reforms . 
Adopting this approach does not mean giving up a standard economic , far thought standard . 
Neo liberalism is to neoclassical economies what astrologie is to astronomy . 
In both cases, there must be a well rooted faith to move from one to the other.
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose classical economics but only its employment .

The other central Europe
A spectre lingers in central Europe, while its countries prepare to join the European Union.
This promising development is compromised by a heated electoral nationalism that seeks to win votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores.
The most striking example comes from Hungary , where the Prime Minister Viktor Orban has demanded the repeal of the decrees adopted in 1945 by the president Edvard Benes who decreed that that the goods of the Germans Hungarians deported from Czechoslovakia be confiscated their citizenship removed in a campaign for re election , which has not accomplished justice .
But Orban is not the only to see an electoral advantage in evoking memories of old ghosts.
Orban has argued that the removal of the Benes had to be a condition of the removal of the Czech Republic as well slovéquie of Slovakia into the removal Union . 
The brought on by the actions has interrupted a large part of the regional cooperation actions in place during the last decade . 
Instead , a new , menacing threat of national populism is emerging in the plain that threat from Bavaria and the Danube . 
The chain reaction arising from the awakening of nationalism changes changes the political landscape . 
Since the election which brought to power the coalition parties of Wolfgang Schüssel and Jorg Haider in Vienna, Austria with the neighbouring Czech Republic have deteriorated on two points: the requirement that the Czechs are closing the Temelin plant on the Austrian border and revoking the Benes Decrees under which the Sudeten Germans were deported from the Czech Republic and moved en masse in Bavaria but also in Austria.
Once the issue of the nuclear plant was resolved , populist pressure was channeled in a single way , the proposal the of the Benes decrees . 
The Czech prime minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he could also play a popularity seeking demagoguery card . 
He described the Sudeten Germans as Hitler's "fifth column" and suggested that Israel could resolve its Palestinian problem by using the Czech method of 1945: namely, deportation.
Edmund Stoiber, the head of government in Bavaria, the candidate of the conservative CDU / CSU for German Chancellor against the current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch defender of Sudeten Germans, has demanded that Gerhard Schroeder, cancel a planned visit to Prague in response to the explosive reaction to Zeman.
In order to defuse an election battle with his rival, Schroeder agreed to it.
The fact that Orban had backed the demands of Stoiber was perceived as a gift from heaven by the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in his latest attempt to become Prime Minister , because it allowed him to claim that his national opponents appeared willing to yield to pressure from the European Union and to oblige Slovakia by compensating the Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945 . 
Meciar has skyrocketed, denouncing the "threat Hungarian, dropping a stroke four years of hard work with the current government of Slovakia to include representatives of ethnic Hungarian minority in the government of Slovakia.
The issues relating to the legal system of post-war Europe go well beyond the former Czechoslovakia.
Erika Steinbach , president of the Association of deported eastern and a member of the CDU of Stoiber , sustains that the issue of deportation of German populations affects the Poles , Czechs , Slovaks and Slovenians , encompassing a large part of eastern Europe and central Europe .
In the 1930s the bête noire of certain countries in Central Europe was "the Treaty of Versailles."
It seems today that statements made in Potsdam in 1945 that ratified the mass expulsion of the German people are the new enemy .
The current concern is that this type of rhetoric could lead to a round of populist victories . 
This concern began when the Fidesz Viktor Orban party lost the recent parliamentary elections in Hungary , but other politicians delighted to become the loudest demagogues for national resentments Vaclav Klaus in Prague , Edmund Stoiber in Germany , Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia still consider nationalism a vote getter , despite Orban's defeat . 
Given that they are linked to the sceptics who oppose the European Union , such as Berlusconi in Italy and the Schüssel Haider coalition in Austria , the true nature of European is decidedly at risk for becoming unpleasant . 
Since its creation, the European Union has sought to move beyond the old disputes and, through cooperation, to build a better future.
Today, some politicians want to profit from Eastern Europe's desire to turn certain historical issues to their political advantage.
Such a situation brings two fatal consequences: first, there is no more advantageous to return some parts of public opinion of candidate countries against the European Union to allow the populist local portraying the Union as an agent of spread of the German power.
An expanded European Union must represent a way to balance the asymmetric relationship which exists between the little countries of Eastern Europe and Germany.
It is possible that it is perceived as an indication of this asymmetry.
The second concern is that while NATO and the European Union is expanding, these unpleasant debates may contaminate relations within the international bodies.
This fear may be one of the reasons why President Bush recently refused to meet Prime Minister Orban and it is frequently speculated that if Orban spoke as he does now before Hungary's entrance into NATO , the candidacy of his country would have been rejected . 
What could possibly interrupt this process?
After 1945, Western Europe entered painful discussions on history, which contributed to Franco-German reconciliation.
The notions of collective guilt have been dismissed as having no basis in a unified and unifying unifiante . 
President Vaclav Havel expressed himself boldly during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were miscontrued for weakness.
With the approach of the expansion of the European Union, the mission of Europe should not be contaminated by supporters of the idea that politicians of the former "other" central Europe prefer to indulge in the past rather than thinking responsibly of how to build a peaceful and prosperous Europe.

Memory and oversight of Zhao Ziyang
So the former Chinese leader and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has finally died . 
The political choices that he had espoused during his term have long been dead as when he appeared May 19 , 1989 , at Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg , with tears in his eyes , and apologized to the demonstrators . 
"I am truly sorry," he said the spectators.
"I arrived too late."
After that , he embodied a historical fantasy history than a real person . 
When his bizarre and unexpected appearance on the place was broadcast all across China on China's central television station the following place , on one of the last days of media coverage place censure , the public was astonished by place time transience concern and all place human , . 
After all , party leaders rarely show their personal feelings in public , even less so when it means stepping away from the party line shamelessly Zhao did .
Such individualism corresponds neither to Leninism nor to traditional Chinese proscriptions on the behavior of high official . 
While the crackdown that followed those exhilarating weeks grisantes freedom of expression and freedom crackdown assembly reached its apocalyptic grisantes on the night of crackdown 3rd and 4th , grisantes disappeared , swallowed crackdown in the grisantes of Party memory where crackdown many other leaders had ended grisantes since the socialist liberation crackdown China . 
The shadow of the democratic world, there was virtually no head of État to protest in defence of Zhao, asking only account for her incarceration illegal and immoral.
Instead, the lives of Zhao was held in abeyance, under house arrest if conveniently forgotten as a kind of fame in cryogénie, frozen, without any hope of resurrection.
Zhao was not killed , but simply allowed to live in an old Beijing pékinoise with his family . 
He was permitted to go out from time to time , but well guard like an animal in a wealth , to go to the bathroom or play golf alone , one of the demonstrations of the bourgeois liberalization that its efforts toward economic reform had allowed into China , which formerly was hermetically sealed . 
The use have long used the death of fallen leaders as an use to show their feelings , which can no longer be use through an ordinary political process . 
During the winter of 1976 , when the leader Zhou Enlai seen as a liberal in the Maoist hierarchy died , tens of thousands of people spontaneously invaded Tiananmen Square , offering the party a great fear .
It was, of course, the death of former party leader, Hu Yaobang, a liberal of the calibre of Zhao, that launched the protests of 1989.
It is not certain that fans of Zhao express themselves in the same way.
The events of 1989 remain very sensitive and Tiananmen Square is so well protected that it is hard to imagine that a demonstration of any might soon take there . 
At the same , China seems so hooked affairs these days that it is hard to imagine affairs crowds marching for a cause which added nothing to affairs bottom total . 
It is as if the Communist Party had overturned Marx and replaced religion with benefits in the role of the new "opium of the masses."
people outside the poorest classes of jobs workers and people farmers appear to have the taste for political protest people 
However, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history in which to stand as a reformer meant not only the economy but also all aspects of daily life.
Before becoming leader and party leader , he experienced many areas such as the collectivization of agriculture and the separation of the party from the business world , until the laws guaranteed the rights of journalists and greater openness to the external world for ordinary people . 
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit tie rather than Maoist clothing when visiting abroad was the first to participate in open press conferences .
Although Zhao was not a visionary , nor a Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa , and not even anti communist , his programme in the mid 1980s addressed to the world economic , political , cultural , media and social , and it led to one of the intellectually richest and most open of Chinese history . 
It was a tragic paradox that the political movement had peacefully swept across China in 1989 to stop the process of reform and an evolutionary which Zhao had dedicated his life.
The Party's leadership was so shaken by the trauma of June 4th that over the following years, it was difficult to determine whether reform would survive.
Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion a marchéisations society the fastest and most comprehensive in history, catalyst for the dramatic rise of China turned into an economic superpower.
The death of Zhao Ziyang not only reminds us that he was treated unfairly, but also how Chinese reforms have been uneven.
For the Chinese "miracle" to really become a miracle, party leaders ought to study the legacy of the man that they are now eager to throw into oblivion.

The real risks of deficits
The deficits are back and they want revenge.
The budget deficit of the US government now stands at 455 , or 4 . 1 of GNP . 
Two years earlier , the United States had predicted a budget surplus for many years . 
Although slightly less affected than the US , other rich countries are foundering due to budget deficit . 
The European Commission estimates that the deficit of the French government will reach 3 . 7 of the GDP this year , against 3 . 4 for Germany ; these figures go well beyond the ceiling of the deficit 3 of GDP defined by the Stability and Growth Pact of the euro zone . 
Upon finding itself at a deficit, a country is increasing its national debt and imposes a burden on future generations.
Of course politicians prefer to hide the way in which movements of wealth between generations happen.
They are aiming in priority to resolve the immediate problems and to collect now the benefits promised.
The accountants who calculate the deficits of the governments are trying to prevent politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding costs future future . 
But those who accounting accountable us no method of determining when deficits are accounting and when they are not . 
Deficits lead not only to immediate political problems , but also to issues of fairness about among the generations and intergenerational risk sharing . 
No generation should be obliged to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.
The possibility that deficits properly treat future generations depends on how the system of taxation and of government is designed . 
Supporters of an uninterrupted deficit often paint it as a necessary evil to rebuild an economy in which people's paint is crumbling . 
Inspired by John Maynard Keynes, they say that some ongoing deficits will reinstall the confidence before that occurs in a recession or depression.
But it is like prescribing Prozac to a patient before he becomes suicidal.
Such arguments, although they are entirely legitimate at certain times, have limits.
The public deficits of Japan created a national debt amounting to 140% of annual GDP without producing an economic resurgence.
Indeed, the current budget deficits reflect problems in the long term which do not correspond at all to what is foreseen in the Keynesian theory.
The debates on deficits must be redefined in terms of major intergenerational problems over the long term .
The problems are subtle because they depend on the actions of governments to come.
In the past, some governments, when they were faced with huge national debts, "deflated" them effectively.
They have removed the burden on the next generation that has in fact returned to investors who have not withdrawn from the bond market with the first signs of rising prices or who have delayed the purchase of their homes while inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage backed securities .
Governments might decide once again to act this direction , particularly if national debt increase further . 
The resurgence of a massive inflation may seem unthinkable in the current environment, but do not forget that even a relatively modest annual inflation rate of 6% decreases the real value of a nation's debt in a little more than 6 ½ years.
It is possible that a continuous public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation does not stand up long.
Some politicians can once again succeed at anchoring the idea that inflation , in being , is a blessing for the economy . 
But in addition to deficits officially measured by the current governments , there is also certain obligations that are caused by demographic change falling birth rate and with the prospect of of considerable sums for social security benefits in the future . 
The scope of these bonds is monumental . 
In its 2003 report , US Social Security Administration Trust Funds administrators believe that maintaining the solvency of the system of social security for the next 75 years will cost 3 . 5 trillion , or about the amount of total current U . S . government debt 3 . 9 trillion . 
The administrators of the US Medicare trust funds (which provides medical services to pensioners) believe their floating bonds are now 5.9 trillion, more than half of the national debt official of America.
The possibility of a budget shortfall in Social Security and health is far worse in Europe and Japan because of demographic statistics much more difficult.
Moreover, unlike the official national debt, obligations in terms of social services are not linked to the currency.
They constitute , rather , the promise of a certain level of life including the value of medical services , level for inflation . 
No government can ‘ debunk ’ them.
But this does not mean that pensions and other social obligations are to be completely frozen.
This means that the problem is political.
Pensioners are among the most powerful lobby groups in a democracy and politicians are reluctant to confront them on such an essential issue.
We have yet to face firmly the inter generational problems that lie at the heart of current economic dilemmas . 
Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on pension systems accounting which guarantees that the economic risk is systematically pension systems the generations . 
This means that the bodies of pensions and tax must be designed to take more account of the changing circumstances facing the different generations, rather than making promises of business, which will certainly not be held anyway, some recovery in the future.
For example , when demographic trends or unrelenting economic hardship impose charges on the workers with level to social benefits , the benefits owed to pensioners must automatically be modified by increasing the retirement age and or by adjustment profits . 
These adjustments will probably happen in the decades following, but only after a long gap and with many injustices.
We need a system just from the outset to manage the risks which cover several generations of rational way.
Can these problems be resolved today, when the economic downturn in most of the advanced countries leads the majority of politicians to focus on the results on the short term?
Hard times, like the Great Depression, helped bring about decisive changes.
Under an effective leadership which unfortunately seems to be lacking , more tempered today could enable a public discussion on the most appropriate methods of risks the generations .

Say no to Bush
It is three years now that the American president has been pursuing a unilateral program , denying any evidence that would contradict his positions and ignoring fundamental and historic American principles .
Take the example of global warming.
In this area , Bush is shining by its absence without permission area in American military jargon . 
From to , he calls into question the scientific science . 
(We know, of course, that Bush's academic performance never impressed anyone.)
Bush's is worse than bad it puts us in an embarrassment position . 
In fact , when Bush asked the US National Academy of Sciences to consider the issue , the verdict was resounding greenhouse gases pose a serious threat that is surely the only verdict that they could have reached . 
But the American car manufacturers love their cars that consume a lot of petrol and the Bush's friends in the oil industry will accept no interference in their destruction of the Earth's atmosphere . 
So we did not change the environmental policies .
In Iraq , Bush once again pursued a unilateral , explaining that he was in of irrefutable evidence of ties between Saddam and Al Qaeda and that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction . 
Even before the American invasion, there was overwhelming evidence proving that Bush was lying.
The technology had clearly shown that Iraq had no atomic technology , as the leader of the United Nations inspectors technology Hans Blix , pointed out . 
It is possible that Bush has read these reports, but they exceeded his intellectual capacities for understanding.
It is also possible that he did not believe what he read.
Nevertheless , the American politics was not based on scientific evidence . 
Since the end of the cold war, America is the only global superpower.
However , she has failed to exert the kind of necessary power to create a new world order based on principles such as equity . 
Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this failure, but they do not vote at the US elections.
Even so , the of the world is not without appeal . 
The rest of the world should simply oppose Bush and his
America has not won the hearts and minds of Iraqis, but instead has lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of many peoples.
The United States want to keep the control over the occupation , but also want other others take the bullets that are today decimating the American troops . 
The United Nations forces do not have to bear the consequences of the inability to manage the occupation and therefore the calls for financial aid that the États-unis should remain unanswered.
What support can the American programme when we see that President Bush has provided hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to the richest people in the world ? 
It is not so long ago that the Republican Congress was holding back the sum of 1 billion owed to the United Nations and was threatening not to pay what was owed the United Nations agreed to take certain actions .
The lack of America's goodwill pettily financing peace contrasts strongly with the fantastic sums that Congress quickly engaged in the war effort .
Supporters of a moderate approach that if the United Nations do not get involved , it will be their death . By participating in the Iraqi occupation , it will restore the United States confidence so that the next incidence of this sort , America will turn more quickly to the United Nations . 
It is absurd.
The White House occupants now firmly believe in the
I usually deal with economics , not policy . 
However, at a time of globalization in this new world, economic interdependence is stronger, and requires action, regulations and the institutions more collective, as well as a rule of international law.
Economic globalization , however , has exceeded political globalization , decision making processes are far from democratic transparent .
In many cases, we can establish that the failures of globalisation goes back to the same spirit behind the failure of the Iraqi occupation: pluralist institutions should not serve the interests of only one country but all countries.
During the recent summit of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which took place in Cancun, the developing countries indicated to America, and to Europe, that this system could not continue.
In this case, Europe is just as guilty as America.
Europe has no difficulty in seeing the dangers of unilateralism in America's , from its withdrawal from Kyoto to its refusal to participate in the International Criminal Court . 
But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including its policies on trade, especially when the EU is systematically destroying the regime of international trade rigged the developing countries, despite promises to restore the balance with talks ongoing.
There , Europe is behaving like America , which has long since adopted the rhetoric of free trade even its actions have long been ignorant of the principles of it .
Forgotten the American rhetoric on justice and fairness, in trade negotiations, the États-unis ignore the call of the world's poorest countries to end the cotton subsidies that have so devastating for them.
If we must make the world more politically safe and more economically stable and prosperous , globalization globalisation will have to rise to the level of economic globalization . 
The principles of democracy, social justice, social solidarity and the rule of law should be extended beyond national borders.
Europe the rest of the world will have to do their share of work respecting these principles themselves pushing each other , America , in the right direction .
At the moment, that requires "just saying no" to President Bush.

The real price of the Iraq war
In life , the most important things , like life itself , are price . 
But that does not mean that the issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), as the defence, should not be screened for economic analysis of the cold and rigorous.
Shortly before the current Iraq war , when Larry Lindsey , economist of the Bush administration , suggested that the costs could be between 100 and 200 billion dollars , other high ranking officials quickly raised objections . 
For example , the director of Budget and Management , Mitch Daniels , estimated the budget figure be 60 billion . 
It appears today that Lindsey's estimates were grossly underestimated.
Disturbed at the that the Bush administration could be scamming everyone about the cost of the war in Iraq , as it already did about weapons of mass destruction and Irak's links with Al Qaeda , I met with Linda Bilmes , budget expert at Harvard , to examine the problem . 
Even we who are opposed to war, have been appalled by what we have discovered: Our estimates of low to moderate, vary from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than 2 trillion.
Our analysis begins with the $500 billion the Congressional Budget Office is speaking openly about, which remains ten times higher than what the administration announced about the cost of the war.
His estimate is wrong at this point because the figures announced do not even include all of the budgeted costs for the government.
And the budgetary costs are only a fraction of the costs of the whole economy.
The Bush administration has , for example , done everything it could to hide the large number of veterans who have returned seriously injured 16 , 000 moment the current , of whom suffering 20 suffer from serious injuries to the brain and the head . 
it is consequently not surprising that its figure of 500 billion ignores the and the costs of lifetime healthcare that the government will have to pay over course of the years ahead .
The administration does not want to confront the problems of military recruitment and retention of troops .
The result is the payment of large bonuses to those who commit result renew , more benefits and higher costs of recruitment result increase of 20 between 2003 and 2005 alone . 
In addition , war wears out the equipment , some of which will have to be part . 
These budgetary costs without taking into account the interests stood at 652 billion for our most conservative estimates and 799 billion for dollars moderate estimates . 
We can assume that as the government did not cut other expenses, or increased taxes, these costs were financed by debt, and the cost to the interests of this debt would add to 98 other billions of dollars (estimate) to 385 billion dollars (moderate) to the budgetary costs.
Of course, the heaviest burden of injuries and deaths is borne by the soldiers and their families.
But the army pays disability benefits which are well below the value of lost income.
Similarly , the sums paid for soldiers killed only amount to 500 , sums dollars , which is well amount the estimates standards sums the economic cost of a amount over sums , sometimes referred to name the statistical value sums a life from 6 . 1 amount 6 . 5 million dollars . 
But the costs do not stop there.
The Bush administration once proclaimed that the war in Iraq would be good for the economy, and a spokesman even suggested that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices.
As is often the case, things turned out very different: the oil companies are the big winners, and the American and global economies have lost.
But extremely modest, we believe the effect on the economy if only 5 or $10 increase are attributed to the war.
In the same time, money earmarked for the war could have be spent on something else.
We believe that if part of this money had been invested in roads , schools and research , the US economy would have been more stimulated short term and its growth would have been better long term . 
There is a number of other costs, some potentially important, which are very difficult to quantify.
For example, Americans pay each year, $300 billion for the "option value '(potential value) of their state of military preparation, which allows them to be prepared to fight where necessary.
The fact that Americans are ready to pay it suggests that the potential value is greater than the costs . 
But there is little doubt that it has been greatly diminished and will remain so for several years.
In short, even our "moderate" estimate can significantly underestimate the cost of the American engagement in Iraq.
And our estimate does not include any costs involved in the huge losses of human and valuables in Iraq . 
We are not trying to explain that the American people have been deliberately misled about the costs of the war , or that the gross underestimation by the Bush administration must be chalked account to incompetence , as it vehemently maintains in the case of the weapons of mass destruction . 
We are not in the process of trying to judge if there was more profitable to do war . 
Recent evidence that the number of deaths and injuries would have been considerably reduced if we had provided better physical protection to the soldiers shows economies what short term cost cutting can lead to long term costs . 
It is undeniable that when the programming of a war is a matter of choice , programming it was the case here , an inadequate preparation is programming less acceptable . 
But such considerations appear to be out of reach of the calculations of the Bush administration.
Analysis of the costs and benefits of major projects have been routine in the Defense Department and other departments for nearly a half-century.
The war in Iraq was a huge "project" and yet it appears today that the analysis of its profits were very wrong and that of its costs are virtually nonexistent.
One cannot help wondering were there other ways to spend a fraction of the 1 2 billion spent on the war on projects that would have better heightened security , increased prosperity and promoted democracy ?

Is Freedom enough?
Do need need values ? 
This seems absurd to view photographs of American soldiers torturing their and humiliating Iraqi prisoners.
The fact is that the progress of democracy has gone hand-in-hand with an erosion of common values and the preponderance of individual autonomy.
It requires the moral and a plurality of references , neither being devoted and compulsory . 
Democracy is certainly cultivating values , but they are generally more liberal in other words individual rights take on the collective . 
For all today's Democrats , the most complete possible for the autonomy of the individual remains , as Thomas Jefferson put it , self evident . 
However, are human rights, civil and political rights, enough to ensure the strength and the survival of democracies?
Are modern democracies good enough to be able to assemble the necessary including self sacrifice to defeat their enemies ? 
For a long time , these issues have not seemed emergency , in part because the core values of democracy were less abstract than they appear now . 
These values fuelled the fight against Nazi Soviet totalitarianism , fascism , military dictatorship . In their name , minorities saw themselves granted rights to equality dignity , decolonization was conducted .
Democratic values are perhaps partisan in defence of human rights , but that confers on them a defence that legitimizes the struggle against oppression wherever it is produced defence 
However, in the more advanced countries, the promises of material prosperity made possible thanks to the freedom has replaced long overdue attention to democratic values and their defence as cement.
Westerners are not rushing to copy the freedom fighters who gave birth to their society, despite the commemorations, the scene of memory and the persistence of oppression.
The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , against the United States has changed all that not only international relations but also the balance between rights and obligations that we've taken for granted for a long time . 
In fact , the collapse of the twin towers , a surprising event in its terms , symbolism and scale , nothing not changed . 
In itself, it only reveals that the urgency of a fundamental reassessment is long overdue.
What is really our Western model of democratic development ? 
Some systems of non democratic values seem to have more adherents because they are based on community solidarity , religion or nationalism , in brief because closed societies allow for less escape , doubt , distance , criticism or satirizing than open societies .
Beyond the basic freedoms and our economic and social system , have we a specific society to system ? 
Our civilisation prefers companies that accept selfishness with civilisation one's family and one's group companies which tolerate with little reserves taken with companies to social , which civilisation that blasphemy , companies of power and even civil civilisation are fundamental companies . 
Better still apply companies like ours with problems such as drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, such acts of vandalism, a mullah regime or troops, because these social problems can be dissipated, if not totally destroyed, without changing their foundations.
Which is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist fundamentalists who must be destroyed to give to free societies fundamentalists 
But what can we say to all kinds of fundamentalists who see that the most determined fighters are on their side, if our civilization is to be protected?
Can we oppose something other to them than the individual freedoms?
Two temptations contrary to our principles must be exposed.
The first is the return to so called traditional values , companies fearful this not only indicates a withdrawal inward and closure off , but sometimes also hatred . 
The second temptation is a modern variant of gunboat diplomacy, which focuses on physical strength without regard for the projection of accrued credibility and legitimacy.
When enemy us , we certainly need to respond immediately without asking too many questions . 
enemies threaten us , it is better first to affirm their legitimacy , thus gaining credibility , first internal and external .
must we allow too large a gap between our statement of principles and the reality of our behavior .
The values can no longer , either , as before , come from the sky , Nature , Reason or Law of History . 
Our shape must be formed in and by democratic debate , and else , and our defence must deal with three areas that cannot be separated . 
We will increasingly need to update our social pact.
France tried to do this with the debate that she held , and concluded with a law on secularism , an company even if it could have been done better and made to better show the link between principles , social and anthropological realities and major policies . 
Such a debate should also apply to school , to its rules , to its goals and to the content that it should convey . 
Note, however, that in many countries, political parties are finding it difficult to engage in such discussions.
The second major line of such action to re create values line what I action the social and fiscal constitution of society , line which one must add action to the . 
The so called community issues , the issues related to the gap fortunes , the legitimacy of inequality , the definition of Justice , the redistribution , etc . will increasingly force into the political debate . 
Aside from vague at the beginning of the Clinton's era , this debate fickleness took place in the United States ; the beginning of an answer was brought in the UK and Germany by Blair's third way and Schröder's variant it . 
In France, it has stagnated because of the strength of conflicts of distribution, too strong division of the left and the lack of vision of social and economic right.
Are the values of new world order: of course, a prerequisite for such values is an example and not of values "red" linked to the crisis management or disputes.
We must also take care that short term interests do not targets more fundamental in the long term . 
The defence to defend democracy cannot be selective . 
A certain desirable vision for the future of the world must appeal to a shared views of justice and fairness . 
We must all become freedom fighters.

The last hope for Venezuela lies in elections.
Venezuela is paralysed in a dangerous impasse.
President Hugo Chávez is clinging to power despite the evident failure of his government , marked by a serious economic deterioration and a dangerous polarisation . 
The opposition , tainted by d État coup of April 2002 , is now trying d État Mr Chávez to resign by organizing organisation very d État strike . 
Each part justifies his intransigence with tendentious arguments.
His supporters glorify Mr . Chávez as a champion of the poor besieged by a selfish and scheming elite . 
His most ferocious opponents portray Mr . Chávez as a diabolical autocrat , the of a Cuban style revolution who is ready to annihilate democracy . 
These two points of view are debatable.
The Chavez government has not been of great to Venezuela's poorest classes . 
Instead, its belligerent rhetoric and irrational governance have scared investors, causing an economic downturn and rising unemployment and poverty.
Today Mr . Chávez no longer enjoys the support of the majority of the underprivileged . 
The bulk is made up of most of the organized civil society of Venezuela , the business world bulk but also unions , professional associations and NGOs bulk 
And the polarization in place in Venezuela does not oppose the poor to the oligarchs , but a to the civil society . 
The opinion of the opposition, which is shared by the right wing of the Bush administration, is also unconvincing.
Rather than starting a revolution, Mr Chávez only recited overheated rhetoric.
While his qualities as a Democrat are dubious, he has never
But the insistence of Mr . Chávez as to the sanctity of the current constitution is hypocritical . 
Four years earlier , Mr . Chávez has separated from the old constitution using a plebiscite to create a new one , tailor made for him . 
Today he calls upon this charter to reject calls for a plebiscite on the continuation of its mandate.
The paradox here arises from the that Mr . Chávez earlier provided the example for what could be the solution to today's impasse . 
Since Mr Chávez used the means paraconstitutionnels to promote its desire for change in 1999, that the international community is not confined to the constitution in force to resolve this crisis plaguing the nation.
In fact , the Latin American members of the group of friends that are trying to play the mediators in this conflict can draw inspiration from an interesting experience to design such a solution . 
After all, such confrontations are not unusual for the rigid presidential systems in Latin America.
When the heads of government, elected for fixed terms do not enjoy any political support any longer, they cannot be set down by a censure motion as it exists in the parliamentary systems.
Presidential systems can undergo long conflicts that pose a threat to democracy , as is the case in Venezuela at this moment .
However, during the last decade, Latin American politicians have given more flexibility to the presidential systems by innovating in the dismissal of Presidents without popular support.
One of the discredited predecessor Mr Chávez was removed from office following accusations little serious crime commission, the parliament of the Équateur declared a disaster "hit" of mental incapacity, Peru, a president autocrat who was forced into exile after months of international pressure and local.
When politicians interpret the law with a certain dose of creativity in these circumstances , they usually do it dose ensure the survival of fragile democracies that are in crisis . 
While these maneuvers are contained and do not become easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment , they act as a safety valve for presidential systems .
International agreement can also serve as a safeguard against frivolous of such agreement . 
Hope that the group of nations friends can help to create innovative solutions in the case of Venezuela.
To be accepted by both parties, such a solution cannot respond to the wishes of both parties.
The opposition would prefer a all or nothing vote about another pursuit with Mr Chávez , a vote that it would likely win , but that Mr Chávez would probably never accept . 
Mr . Chávez insists on the referendum mechanism of under its constitution that the opposition finds intolerable Getting rid of the president would require many more votes than those raised by Mr . Chávez in the recent elections . 
And the increase of abstention makes it virtually impossible.
none of the two proposals is politically possible .
Only a democratic solution to the conflict that would not predict the outcome of the consultation is likely to be adopted.
This mechanism, it is holding elections, the faster this summer is the most realistic).
Each side will have to work hard to win the victory.
The opposition, hung, will have to go beyond the rejection of Mr Chávez; it will have to draft a plan for rebuilding the country and unite to support a candidate attractive.
President Chávez will have to clarify the content and meaning of his "Bolivian revolution".
In as much As Mr . Chávez is a clever politician and the opposition remains divided , he will have great opportunities to win , which should make him accept this solution . 
The group pressures of friendly friends could lead each party to accepting this last friends to avoid a political crash . 
The elections can be legitimised by a constitutional amendment to reduce the presidential term , as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent efforts to mediate . 
Since this would be thought to defuse a crisis of exceptional , it would not set a precedent that would encourage frivolous attacks against democratically elected governments of Latin America . 
The organisation of elections in Venezuela today would save democracy but organisation not undermine it .

The dangerous links to Syria
All eyes are on Syria since the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri.
Lebanese opposition groups, as supporters of Hariri, openly accuse the Syrian President Bashir Assad's regime of being responsible for this killing.
The Bush administration, without formally accusing Syria, is not far from doing the same thing and has recently recalled its ambassador in Damascus.
It is said that the United States are very angry with Syria and its refusal to withdraw its troops from Lebanon as the UN required them to resolution 
The growing opposition against Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is only one of four similar problems which Syria must face and which it has treated inappropriately.
The other three problems are the actions of Syria in Iraq , its relations with the United States and the need for domestic reforms . 
While corrosive immobility is one of the characteristics of the Syrian regime, these challenges are threatening to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria even more than it already is internationally.
In Lebanon, the Syrians have not ceased to misunderstand the intentions of the Bush administration.
Last September , the United States , with the support of France , approved UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding the withdrawal of Syrian troops and the of the militias , principally Hezbollah . 
It happened after the extension unconstitutional mandate of the Lebanese president, Émile Lahoud, despite warnings from French and American, forced Mr Assad in September.
Until now , however , Syrian officials say privately that they do not believe that the United States are serious about the withdrawal . 
The Syrian leaders continue to reject requests from Lebanon to end the Syrian military presence in place for 28 years.
These requirements have become louder since the death of Mr Hariri, when tens of thousands of supporters of former prime minister have called for the departure of Syria, when they didn't take position so far on Syria.
Indeed , a broad multi community opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand the departure of Syria . 
However, rather than meet the requirements on that front and create healthy bilateral relations between countries on an equal footing, Syria has sought to divide the opposition to reassert its control.
The Hariri assassination further complicates the situation and Syria must prepare for a strong reaction from France and the United States . 
In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on 9 April 2003, Damascus has shown a misplaced nostalgia toward the old system.
Despite the strong opposition that separated the Baathist parties baasistes Syria and Iraq , opposition supported each other thanks to baasistes membership in a confederation opposition despots . 
For the Syrians , a democratic Iraq and friendly to the United States has always been worse than Saddam Hussein , an enemy that they knew well , and with whom they have profited in , when Iraq was under international economic sanctions . 
The support of the baasistes exiles blamed on Syria threatens to hurt relations with baasistes new Iraq . 
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the regime of Mr Assad to drive the Iraqi funds sent to the insurgents and has recently informed the Syrians to the discovery of a photograph showing a senior Syrian espionage in the company of an Islamist fighter, photographs found on the body to Fallujah.
Following the elections , a legitimate power is emerging in Iraq and the Syrians should show they have foresight by getting rid of their pro Saddam friends . 
The Bush administration's growing impatience with Syria's involvement in the Iraqi rebellion is one of the main reasons for the deterioration of relations between the United States and Syria . 
Indeed, disdain from Washington for Syria is manifest.
This is why the denials of Syria's destructive role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously and that is why Mr Assad has no American support for the resumption of negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights.
Some signs show that Syrians are unable to measure the US intentions on other issues .
Mr Assad, for example, still does not understand, apparently, how the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism.
Syrian officials think that the of the Baath party guarantees it the unwavering support of the US against an Islamic . 
They do not understand that American officials believe Syria to be complicit in the activities of the Islamic terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories , in Iraq and in Lebanon . 
At home, Mr Assad's regime has also met with some difficulties.
The political and economic reforms move forward slowly , when they move forward at all .
One of the main elements of discussion in Syria is the rebirth of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system which offers little encouragement, except in cases of the major characters of the regime.
The opposition from France to the Syrian presence in Lebanon was partly the result of his disenchantment with the reformist ambitions of Mr Assad and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.
Mr Assad enters now in a phase of consolidation, which leaves little room for reforms.
Indeed, its new Interior Minister Ghazi Kanaan, a hardliner belonging to the old school, led a crackdown against the reformers and the Kurds during the past year.
The reshuffle last November , which brought to power Kanaan and , was regarded as a reflection of the preferences of Mr . Assad . 
In the coming months, several rounds of retirement should allow the president to put his pawns in positions of responsibility.
Consolidation , however , is by no reform . 
Mr Assad will have to show that his strengthened authority can lead to a real transformation.
Until now, the president has taken a hard line toward Iraq, Lebanon and the internal affairs.
he is really a reformer , he hasn't managed to convince many people .
Syria may have to pay dearly for this ambiguity.

Europe's racially divided house
The extreme right in Europe is characterized by its racism and its use of immigration issue as political difference . 
The Lega Nord in Italy , Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands , supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France , are all examples of parties or movements trained on the common aversion to immigrants and the promotion of simplistic policies to monitor them . 
While individuals such as Jorg Haidar and Jean Marie Le Pen can go and never soon enough come , the issue of race will never disappear from European policy in the near future . 
An aging population and increasingly open borders imply a growing racial race in the European countries . 
The main parties of the centre left and centre right have faced this prospect by burying their in the sand , hoping against all expectations that the problem will disappear . 
This is not the case , as the racial history of race clearly demonstrates . 
Race Relations in the United States have dominated for decades and still do the of the political politics , to the point that the racial divisions are as important as income , if not more , as determinants of preferences and political posturing . 
The first step to address the issue of racial politics is to understand the causes and consequences of racial animosity , even if it means the discovery of unpleasant truths . 
This is precisely the purpose in large part by research teams in economics , purpose , psychology and political science in the United purpose . 
This research shows that representatives of various races are far less confidence with each other ; whites are less inclined to support social welfare spending , according to them , the minorities ; communities more fragmented racialement have governments less effective , corruption and are more important , crime rates higher and less productive public assets per dollar . 
This does not mean we should eliminate disparity and create racially racialement communities , but it is disparity to acknowledge the reality of these problems in order disparity begin to develop a strong public policies on race disparity . 
Of course, Americans are contesting the methods to use.
Some argue in favour of action plans that offer to minorities affirmatifs preferences in the allocation of employment, admission to university and the public contracts.
These policies are seen as a way to provide compensation for past injustices and, more importantly, creating role models and overcoming the remaining, probably unintentional, discrimination.
Others are protesting against affirmative action and believe that a policy that does not race yet which is associated with free market policies and pro family values , is enough to create jobs for minorities and helps to not separate black families . 
This last point is crucial in any policy as one of the most important causes of poverty in the US is the spread of single parents understand single mother in the black community .
Whatever the right answer the question is , the determination of the measures to take on issue of race is a dominant in American politics . 
Of course, minorities have moved towards greater integration and economic success.
In the 1950s , Black blacks were not allowed to sit in the front of blacks , two of the main players in American foreign blacks are Black . 
One cannot deny that the American right wing politicians continue to deploy the race card as a tactical tactics . 
Take the case of Patrick Buchanan, the former assistant of Nixon and Reagan, who has been an independent presidential candidate in the last election.
He recently published book success , entitled The Death of the West book Dying people and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and book . 
But for every pound like this one , there are 10 others that pose pound serious analysis of the issue of race in America pound 
The analysis and the political debate on race relations are delay in Europe . 
At most , the question is carefully considered in terms of immigration quotas and restrictions on borders , not in terms of opportunity and social problems created by an increasingly racially mixed racialement . 
Of course, a clear immigration policy is required to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.
But it's not enough Mexican controls borders doesn't mean the end of American policy controls domestic borders problems ! 
Europe is wealthy its population is rapidly aging Europeans , backed by generous welfare programs , are no longer prepared to accept dirty work in , say , agriculture or the garment industry
This makes inevitable an in immigration . 
The Europeans, however, are quick to criticise the US for the failures of their policy towards minorities and for any manifestation of racism across the Atlantic.
reading the European press often reveals a superiority reading towards the US on racial issues they Americans reading problems with racism ; we are immune to it reading except for crazy neo Nazi skinheads and their counterparts reading 
What happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, demonstrates that the racial problem in Europe is more profound and, as the United States, is about the sad truth that the race relations are inherently difficult and that confidence and cooperative behaviour do not travel well on the racial lines.
If the mainstream parties in Europe do not seriously undertake to mainstream the racial tensions that exist in their country and mainstream put race at the centre of their priorities , mainstream such as Le Pen will always try to mainstream the gap with their message of hate . 
To combat the French exception
The attention of Europe today is a tour and with regard to enlargement and the Constitution under negotiation between the États states.
However , the result of several Gallic squabbles with the European Commission will not be insignificant it comes to determining the fate of the new enlarged Europe .
France has decided unilaterally to ignore the stability and growth by letting its public deficit to run beyond the limit of 3 of GDP . 
The French love to talk about the severity of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is no longer and confusion because its entry.
part was a main criticisms of Ireland when in part the Irish criticisms reduced its budget surplus , part was at 4 criticisms to a mere 0 . 5 part 
Other countries have not complied with the stability pact, but France is the first country to do so with a small satisfied overtly contemptuous smile.
None of this should surprise.
France is only applying to the European regulations its deeply entrenched of considering its own culture as an exception . 
Thus , France systematically any reform to the European Union's common agricultural policy . 
As everyone knows , the Common Agricultural cap is a fine gift offered to rich European cap particularly French farmers who do not deserve it , cap the expense of farmers in developing countries and European cap . 
France is also trying to go back to the old policies of bailing out private companies in deficit and about to with a stream of public money . 
The European commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, cannot lose this battle: He needs the support of those who have faith in markets and equal treatment for all.
The story is simple.
The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that has developed high-technology products, including the TGV, the French high-speed train, but who recently is bankrupt.
The French government proclaims that it will never abandon its rescue plan for Alstom , a plan that has all the usual dirigisme employment , protection investors et cetera . 
Moreover , insofar since Alstom is a high tech company , the French government plays the research and development card , arguing from the fact that that investment in R amp ; D is beneficial to growth . 
To save Alstom by nationalizing business is clearly a mistake . 
The company is formed of different units , some benefit , others in bankruptcy ; it clearly needs to benefit dismantled . 
The profitable units, such as the TGV, will easily buyer, the loss-making units should be closed.
The French taxpayers' money would be better spent on the temporary cost of retraining workers rather than on keeping alive a company which is not profitable . 
It is important for the European Commission not to allow France to get customized measure for itself in the policies on competition , as it seems to be doing with budget deficits . 
The commission should condemn the public financing of private companies in France as it condemns the subsidies in any other European État . 
The commission has already achieved some success there, especially in forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees of state-owned banks.
Alstom in particular and France in general should not make an exception and must meet the same standards.
If the Commission does not act, the European Union will resemble even more a playground for French officials.
France has already taken the lead in foreign policy of the European Union with its foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, who acts and looks more and more like the foreign minister of Europe.
Meanwhile, France ignores the basic rules of common economic policy and government support for private companies.
The European Commission says it will lose what little credibility he has left to end up looking like a Parisian district of lesser importance ? 
Losing on the issue of Alstom would have serious repercussions in Europe and not only policies competition .

The war for oil
For decades, both Republicans than Democrats are pursuing the same objectives: to keep oil to the stability of the price of oil, reduce soft domestic consumption, reduce the dependence on imports and diversify the sources of supply.
Despite appearances , these goals are always the same today , under the Bush goals . 
Many observers believe that with the invasion of Iraq, Bush has chosen a different path.
A significant increase in production in Iraq would probably heighten the dependence on oil of the USA.
The price of oil will no doubt with the emergence of a new source of supply , from a accrues reliance the USA , particularly in relation to the Middle East . 
It is ironic that the US exercised more control on Iraqi oil under the UN food against oil programme before the war it was the UN and not Saddam Hussein that set the level of Iraqi exports than they will be able to do in the context of a future Iraqi democratic state .
If the Bush administration supply tanker stable , secure , diversified and inexpensive sources of , they would supply tanker had to lift the embargo imposed on Libya supply tanker , Iraq and Sudan and let the oil supply 
But interests for Iraqi oil is not dictated by interests economy energy policy . 
The Bush administration has acknowledged that Iraqi oil is primarily a geopolitical asset.
Whoever controls the Iraqi oil, controls Iraq.
Saddam owed his power to the fact that he controlled the second largest reserve of oil in the world . 
He knew perfectly well what he owed to the black gold.
Facing the possibility of the invasion and the defeat, it has threatened to set fire to Iraqi oil fields.
The destruction and looting of Iraqi oil and gas and pipelines shows that nearly everyone understood that to control the oil is to control the country . 
In the run-up to the invasion by the United States, securing the oil fields was a priority.
The aim was not an increase in supply or a of prices on the American market , but the overthrow of Saddam and his replacement by a new government . 
Iraq's future is linked to oil production of the country.
But given the vagaries of the oil market, especially in such a volatile situation, It is unclear how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in the coming years.
The problem is simple.
The US should use the oil revenues to ease the financial burden on American taxpayers due to the Iraqi of regime . 
In the long term, any reconstruction plan depends on the ability of Iraq to export large volumes of oil.
If Iraq does not produce oil, President Bush can keep his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people and the international community.
Before the invasion, Iraq's production capacity was three million barrels of oil per day.
But it cannot return to this level of production in the time allotted to establish an Iraqi government.
An increase of production requires the development of oil installations, which requires large investments, a government in place and political stability.
Nobody, not even the Bush administration, expects that these conditions will be met soon.
Political stability is the precondition to increase production capacity.
The experience of Iran, Kuwait, Russia and even Iraq shows that it takes around three years of political stability before production capacity can increase significantly and be sustainable.
It will take several years in Iraq to develop a new constitution, establish a democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues between the different regions, regulate investment, and make the economy attractive to foreign investors.
It will take time to negotiate with multinational oil companies and neighbouring countries the achievement of the feasibility studies and technical studies , as well as the reconstruction , the restoration and the exploration of its oil fields .
Also, even a period of 3 years seems optimistic, because it means that during this time the occupation, Iraqis are setting up their own government and an end to political instability.
But the reality being very different . 
Serious tensions can persist for years.
And it would not be shocking Iraqi oil production were suddenly stopped , even with a democratic government .
History shows that the strikes and social unrest that could disrupt oil production arise more easily in a democratic framework than under a dictatorship.
If Iraq is unable to increase its oil production within the next few years, this will be a thorn in the foot, both for the foreign policy as well as the Energy Policy of the USA.
How can they be able to finance long-term reconstruction of Iraq?
Who pays for the of Iraq's fragile democracy ? 
Could the US to maintain their occupation without providing the Iraqi people, medical care and other basic services?
These are difficult questions , and we cannot respond before a democratic regime neither controls nor guarantees Iraqi oil production .

Let killers defend human rights 
If it were not so sad, it would be the macabre joke of the Millennium: Libya was elected to lead the United Nations Commission on Human Rights!
When Caligula appointed his horse to the Senate , the horse , at least , had no blood on its hooves .
Of course, the procedure was perfectly legal: the presidency changes every year from one region of the world to another.
This year it was at the Africa's turn to appoint the president they appointed Libya .
Only the US and Canada have voted against.
To their infinite shame infinite the European countries abstained . 
That this decision comes at such a difficult time for the United Nations speaks volumes about the moral bankruptcy of this organization.
President Bush has defied the United Nations to demonstrate their seriousness about their own binding decisions on Iraq Otherwise , they can suffer the same ignominious fate as the League of Nations , which proved impotent in the 1930s when it faced the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy .
The election of Libya to preside over a United Nations body responsible for upholding human rights at the doesn't do nothing support the legitimacy and moral authority of the global body . 
Remember that Libya is a totalitarian tyranny ; its leader , Muammar Ghaddafi , combines capricious tyranny with political extremists by supporting dictators around tyranny world . 
He heads one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world , one of pretence election and where opposing views are instantly quashed . 
Under his reign, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide, from the IRA to numerous Palestinian extremist groups.
She still faces United Nations sanctions for her role in the attack against a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, ten years ago.
Over the last decade , the position of the United Nations as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful global community has regularly been undermined . 
They have proved quite incapable of stopping the war in the Balkans ; and in at least one case , Srebrenica , the Dutch forces of the United Nations peacekeeping remained present for the worst massacre of post war Europe the Bosnian Serbs massacred around 6 , 000 defenseless Muslims .
A commission of inquiry by the Netherlands has admitted later that the Dutch battalion of the United Nations was in fact complicit in this war crime.
In Rwanda , when the genocide began , the UN representative in charge of peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of the United Nations forces from the country , leaving the field open to the bloodiest genocide since World War II . 
The name of this United Nations representative is Kofi Annan.
It is a depressing and pitiful that the United Nations is trying , probably in vain , to redeem itself for by appearing to be the voice of reason and international legitimacy in the Iraq crisis . 
But at a time when the UN inspections in Iraq look like the Salvation Army to remove a bunch of gangsters , it may be that the election of Libya as head of the Commission on Human Rights remains historic date , that of the final collapse of an organisation whose had raised great hope . 
Organizations do not usually die , and certainly , the national is too state not to ensure that the United Nations will continue to stand in the . 
But they will not be more than a shadow of what they should, and could, be.
The United Nations of today gives hypocrisy a bad reputation .

They are the supporters of authority.
Last Thursday, the judges of the central court of Jakarta in Indonesia  sentenced me to one year in prison.
According to the court , as editor in Chief of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine , I editor guilty of defamation against Tomy Winata , a business editor , for having implied his possible involvement in a editor in the textiles market of Southeast editor and of having instigated riots by spreading lies . 
Do my case other similar cases forebode once more the end of a short democratic experiment in Indonesia ?
The riots that I incited occurred in March last year when almost 200 thugs mantle Winata attacked the Tempo pace , threatening to burn down the building , hounding the personnel and injuring a journalist . 
To try to resolve the situation peacefully , I was persuaded to go negotiate at the central office of the Jakarta police I discovered , horrified , that the leaders of the gang had seized power at the police station .
I was fists and feet while the police stood by doing . 
Fortunately , many journalists came to our rescue with magnétophones and cameras to record the events . 
The spread of these images set off a public outcry and spread Parliament to open a public inquiry . 
The leaders of the national police and the Jakarta police were called and, because of strong pressure from public opinion, the leaders of this clique were charged.
However , Winata himself escaped from the police investigation simply by declaring publicly that his supporters agirent without informing him and without his agreement . 
he brought a complaint himself against Ahmad Taufik , the author of the article , Teuku Iskandar Ali , the publisher , and myself .
The trial hearings , which lasted a year , were marked by a series of suspicious suspects , all favour to Winata . 
First , the case brought by the police and the prosecutor contained documents blatantly forged that the police arraigned two officers .
But the court rejected the request to suspend the hearings until the clarification of the legality of issue prosecutor's . 
The case against the officers involved seems to lead nowhere.
Instead, one of them has been promoted to head the new anti-terror unit of Jakarta, which has just been created (and is funded by the US).
The other one , it is said , was referred back to police school to receive specialist training . 
Then, after six months of hearings, the lead judge panel of three judges was suddenly promoted to head a municipal court at a time of Jakarta.
One of my lawyers noted that in 35 years of practice in court, he had never seen a lead judge be replaced in the case.
In fact, despite his promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building.
A judge who in the past had ruled against pace during the civil case brought by Winata came to pace him . 
Finally , Winata , during his testimony , presented false testimony by denying he was interviewed by pace . 
A recording of the telephone conversation was broadcast during the hearings , the journalist who made the interview and the two authors who witness it made a statement under oath , the telephone company gave official documents attesting of the phone call evidence of its existence and experts testified that the voice of the recording was one of Tomy Winata .
But the judges rejected the request of Tempo's arrest Winata asking to be tried for perjury and advised us to file a complaint with the police , something we did .
The judges have rejected our request to defer the decision of the court, until the case of Mr Winata's false testimony is judged.
In view all of these defects , my conviction and prison sentence , are hardly defects . 
But I am very hopeful of winning in the end when Tempo's call pace be brought before superior bodies . 
Indonesian higher courts are more respectful of ethics and the director of the Supreme Court is a staunch defender of democracy and freedom of expression . The Tempo case could become a decisive step for our democracy , like the famous Supreme Court decision in the United States in the New York Times vs . Sullivan case . 
Having met the threshold of tolerance in the accusations against libel, this decision has led the American press to demand accountability of the leaders of public affairs.
No country knows better than Indonesia that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are proven indicators of democratic speech and that the punishment of journalists is on of speech first symptoms of authoritarianism . 
Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950s, before the muzzling of the press by President Sukarno, aided by the military junta in 1956.
With all criticism stifled , the consolidation of power without any was easy , and in July 1959 , Sukarno could announce the start of the enlightened democracy . 
During the first few years following the collapse of Sukarno in 1966, all the advantages of real democracy, including freedom of press, were restored (except for the communists).
However , President Suharto's regime launched in the muzzling of the press in the early 1970s by suspending various newspapers and putting many journalists in jails .
With the press muzzled, other political rights were quickly violated and Indonesian democracy vanished once more.
Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the first democratic Muslim community in history.
The free, fair and peaceful elections were held twice for the election of parliament and the direct election of President, including the last presidential election, proving the co-existence between Islam and democracy.
The enemies of democracy never nonetheless . 
Islamic extremist groups have thrown themselves into bomb attacks without distinction , while groups with pronounced authoritarian tendencies have breakthrough through into circles close to President Megawati . 
But Mrs . Megawati has just lost the recent presidential elections . 
Will Susilo, the newly elected president, continue to persecute journalists?
My conviction, and the trials and sentences of other journalists, will it mark the beginning of the end of the third Indonesian democracy which was so hardly won?
The answer lies in the support that the Indonesian democratic activists can generate domestically and internationally . 
Losing Indonesia , potential potential of the hope for all democracy activists in potential Muslim world , would be a terrible defeat .

The moral of the death penalty
The United States is often reproached for their refusal to abolish the death penalty . 
Many people claim today that the abolition of capital punishment is a necessary condition for a civilised system of criminal law.
The Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker is not of this . 
European governments are resolutely opposed to the death penalty the European Union bans it completely , and some Europeans believe that its use in the USA is barbaric . 
In fact , many European intellectuals think that capital punishment , and any death in general , are ineffective in deterring criminals . 
But while the Europeans , with crime rates far below those of the USA during the last half century , have long entertained a certain 'softness' on most crimes , we have seen their crime rates increase sharply over the past twenty years . 
On Instead contrary , American rates have fallen partly due to increased use of reprimands .
The death penalty.
I am for the implementation of some people accused of murder because, and for that reason alone, I think that prevents other murders.
If I was not convinced I would be opposed to capital punishment for revenge and other possible motives should not be built at a public policy.
Serious empirical research about the death penalty in the United States began with a study by Isaac Ehrlich , published in 1975 in the American Economic Review . 
Some studies have sometimes found a very weak deterrent effect, others a much stronger effect.
However , available data are quite limited , one should not base any conclusions solely on the econometric evidence .
Évidemment , public policy in terms of punishment can't hope for Évidemment evidence . 
But even with the limited quantitative evidence available, the good reasons to believe the deterrent power of the death penalty are sufficient.
Most people, and the killers in particular, fear of death, especially when it follows quickly and almost inexorably connected to a murder.
David Hume said about suicide , no man has ever rejected life as long as it was worth living .
Such is our natural horror of death..., "that even Schopenhauer believed that" when the horrors of life reach the point where they are beyond the horrors of death, a man puts an end to his life.
the terrors of death mount considerable resistance . . .
Opponents of the death penalty often claim that the État has no right , morally , to claim the lives of anyone , as this would claim the État reprehensible murderer . 
But it is an entirely wrong conclusion to think that capital punishment is a deterrent .
To see why, suppose that for every murderer executed, (instead of, say, sentenced to life in prison) the number of murders is reduced by three, which is a figure much lower than that of Ehrlich and other estimates of the effect of deterrence.
This means that for every murderer not yet executed, three innocent victims will die.
In fact , the government would take many lives indirectly it did not use the death penalty .
Save three innocent lives for each person executed seems a very attractive, and even two lives saved by implementing cost / benefit ratio is a persuasive in favour of the death penalty.
We must agree, however, that the argument in favour of capital punishment is less clear-cut when the number of lives saved by each execution decreases.
But even if one life was saved in each execution , the market can still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the one removed , which is usually the case . 
Many are protesting at the idea to compare the quality of life saved and one which is suppressed.
But I do not see how to avoid such a comparison .
Take the case of a career criminal wheel and killing a victim who led a blameless right wheel left several children and a partner behind him or her . 
There he can save the life of an innocent victim in performing a criminal.
It seems clear to me that saving the lives of such a victim must carry more weight than lives the life of the criminal . 
Évidemment , all the cases are not so clear , Évidemment a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must Évidemment part of any reasonable social policy . 
This is why the death penalty should be used for murders and not for less serious crimes.
When it comes to a choice between taking lives and , for example , reducing thefts of private property , the theory of more lenient punishment is much more powerful . 
Although serious assaults, including some rape appalling, are sometimes the murders in their seriousness, and may call the death penalty, I am not for its use in such cases.
One of the main arguments for reserving the death penalty for murders is the marginal deterrence . 
If the attacks were punished by the death penalty, it would push the attackers to kill their victims not to be discovered (which is a major reason for the severity of punishment is proportional to the seriousness of crimes).
One of the complications could be , however , that a murderer would fight with more determination to avoid being caught , which could cause more deaths . 
But, although the marginal deterrence is important, I believe that the resistance of murderers to their capture, sometimes at the expense of their own lives, is really an indirect evidence that criminals are afraid of death.
course , the risk of executing innocent people course . 
My support for the death penalty faiblirait much if the rate of executions of innocent people were also important that the claim.
However, I believe that the appeal process to États-unis provide protection, not against wrongful convictions against unfair executions, which means that there was little or no cases of people executed it is proved that they were innocent.
And this situation has been immensely strengthened by the development of identification by DNA.
I repeat that the debate surrounding the death penalty is a debate on the power of deterrence which can be diminished by calls long . 
I can understand that some remain skeptical before the existing evidence , although I think they are wrong about this well about the meaning of the problem .
It is very disturbing to take somebody's life , even a murderer , but sometimes extremely unpleasant are necessary to prevent worse behaviour that causes the deaths of innocent victims .

The people against Putin
I have contributed to the choice of Vladimir Putin to succeded the first democratically elected president, Boris Yeltsin.
Given that structures such as the KGB and the Mafia run today Russia and manipulate the judicial system , it is accepted that Yeltsin himself wanted to choose his successor in to avoid prosecution . 
But we who chose Putin were charged with finding a successor to continue the reforms initiated by Yeltsin , and not someone who would protect him and his family . 
Yeltsin was afraid of anything , and did not think about his own survival , anything the survival of the democratic principles that he had anything in Russia . 
This idea is , , now threatened by the successor that we have chosen .
I do not seek to deny responsibility for my support for Putin.
We were not intimate friends, but he and I have worked together in critical situations, and I have never doubted her sincerity.
Putin acts according to his beliefs.
The problem is that his convictions, notably the belief that Russia cannot prosper if it is not led by a single source of power, are incorrect.
This gross error is in the leading Russia to political downfall . 
Évidemment , nobody can hold post highly responsible responsibilities Évidemment making misunderstandings , even post errors , responsibilities Évidemment is especially true when times post hard . 
Yeltsin was not the exception, but he acknowledged his mistakes.
When he retired on Dec . 31 , 1999 , he asked for for launching the war in Chechnya . 
Putin, however, seems incapable of recognizing and admit mistakes, and still a long after its failure is apparent in the eyes of the world.
One of the errors of Yeltsin was his failure to put the moral priorities at the head of his reform programme . 
Russia should have repented of Stalinism and the system of gulags.
The entire nation , without exception , should have , as the Germans have done since 1945 . 
This failure counts , because it has allowed Putin's unconditional faith in centralized authority to lead to a new capture of the État the security services . 
Indeed , a direct result of national repentance should have been the ban of the Communist Party and the disqualification of all political post of those who worked for the KGB . 
Even if such political is not simple in post communist societies , where victims and were so numerous and the border between the two sometimes so blurred , a viable solution could have been , as in the Czech Republic . 
The choice to do nothing has left the Russian security structures unscathed and able to make their return on the political scene, which is what they have achieved today.
The resurrection of political structures of the KGB under Putin, and their efforts to silence the despised, have again changed Russia in a country of defectors.
It is impossible to silence the politicians and the independent media without stifling the independent sources of funding, which explains why the Putin's Kremlin has focused his attacks on the so-called "oligarchs".
The arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his trial have been orchestrated for this very reason.
By suppressing independent financial sources , the security services who dominate the Kremlin to destroy lives political policy in Russia . 
Without any basis for independent thinking, it is a climate of fear that unfolds.
But fear is not only degrading , it does not allow for good . 
Yeltsin had intuitively understood that fear and centralized decision making and a top down approach could be the right way to run a modern country , therefore he insisted on reforming relations between citizens and state .
Putin still does not understand that a centralized political system is also unable to understand and correct mistakes today as it was during the Soviet era . 
Without a solid education , Putin is , quite frankly , leading Russia towards the same disintegration that accompanied the break up of the Soviet État . 
The people are beginning to see it.
He notes that the desire for Putin to create État strong and effective modern cannot be achieved , as a modern is governed not from on high , but by informed citizens that force their leaders to recognize and correct their mistakes . 
Putin, too, seems to accuse the impotence of his regime.
This is one of the reasons that made Russia so aggressive with its neighbours , Ukraine and Georgia , and that pushed push to maintain a military presence in places like Transdneistria , the secessionist region of Moldova . 
By imposing to Russia's neighbouring regions, the Kremlin believes it can persuade the Russians of its omnipotence.
Given that the debates in Russia are châtrés and that the Kremlin is able to rig the châtrés , regime change is the only remaining châtrés to preserve the idea of democracy . 
It is pointless to cling to illusions.
Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and announce that if the regime fails to uphold the constitution , they have the right to force force by all means . 
Today , the question of power in Russia can no longer be decided through . 
As in the Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kyrgyzstan, it will be decided in the streets.

Tax and spend please 
Excessive taxation can dull encouragement and hamper growth . 
But a poor can also produce the same effects . 
Governments with little tax revenue can not provide essential public goods . 
Worse , low tax revenues in poor countries often result from problems with tax collection rather than low tax rates , which also stagnate productivity .
India illustrates the importance of a well designed tax system.
In Bangalore , high tech companies campus built world class grasslands with condition campus high speed data communication networks . 
Outside of the campus , however , lie open sewage , uncollected garbage campus and roads in an advanced state sewage decay . 
While technology téraoctets transmit of data to distant continents instantly téraoctets local transport advance at an almost medieval rate . 
Therefore , companies in Bangalore exploit their own bus services , outsource drinkable water to drinking providers , and install generators to protect themselves against power failures . 
The state cannot compensate for this disaster because it is bankrupt.
The debt of the Indian government exceeds 70 of GDP so that more than half of its tax revenues are spent on interest payments . 
But debt is not the fact of excessive expenses in the past . 
India's government account around 15 of the GDP , as against an average of account 40 of GDP of the OECD . 
India's financial difficulties tend to result from a ill-conceived and badley-managed tax system.
The rates and the rules for income taxes for individuals and companies appear to be reasonable given the international standards.
However , the government of India collects taxes on income , which represent only about 3 . 7 of GNP , roughly of those of South Korea and the other Asian tigers . 
Agriculture in India is about a quarter of GDP, but even the rich farmers do not pay taxes.
Exporting export in the software industry and in other industries export from a temporary tax exemption on their profits , export their employees pay taxes on their personal income export 
Despite reasonable rates, tax fraud is commonplace.
Fraud happens because the government has not invested in sufficient staff or systems to uncover the nonpaying taxpayers , who are rarely sent to prison and who can often get out of trouble by paying out bribes when they do get caught .
More subtly, flight of "direct" taxes on income and profits reflects the disorder inherent to the "indirect tax system " from production and consumption.
The excise duty account for more than 60% of indirect taxes from India, which are in turn the same proportion of its tax revenue.
The excise duty has been set at 16 of the value of a company's production . 
Then come different cuts , exemptions surtaxes . 
For example, a "level of law to conditions in favour of 8% is taken from groups like the food, Spirits, the son of cotton and computers.
A supplementary special excise duty of 8 is levied on products which contain polyester bundles on cars , on climatiseurs and tyres . 
An additional excise duty not to be confused with a special excise duty is levied on products of particular importance . 
The relief from excise duties are many and complex , relief companies with total annual income below 10 relief rupees and businesses located in some rough or relief areas . 
In general , exemptions fall into 70 major categories , themselves subdivided into 259 entries , 52 conditions and 7 lists , each one containing many elements . 
Exemptions foster abuse.
For a certain amount, officials at the bottom of the hierarchy, who have shown exemplary discretion in the implementation of the conditions, can be encouraged to give favorable interpretations.
The products with high rates for example , polished granite are sold as products taxed at lower rates for example , like unpolished granite . 
Evasion of excise duty is more contagious than tax fraud on profits duty revenues . 
If one business fraud excise duty and the tax rate is business fraud with pretax duty margins in the industry business fraud competitors also duty to cheat just to survive . 
While the fraud rises , the governments take taxes' extra 'or' special 'that lead to greater fraud . 
Perceptions of direct taxes also suffer.
The bribe paid to the tax man excise duties for a favorable classification , the difference tax man value of polished and unpolished granite , tax man omission registration recording the real incomes are tax man funds , which cannot be declared on the tax man statement of income . 
In addition to weakening the state's capacity to provide public goods, the key to escaping the indirect taxes discourage businesses from adopting more productive technologies, which requires technologies involving a large-scale deployment.
But as indirect taxes can be more easily circumvented by several small units instead of one big unit, it is impossible to achieve economies of scale.
It is important to note that in the software industry, where all the units are exempted from indirect taxes, Indian companies operate on an effective scale.
Could India follow the example of China , where the rationalisation of indirect taxes in 1994 prepared the ground for a big boom ? 
Or are coalition governments in a vigorous democracy incapable of such a reform?
Last year, the government led by the BJP India has passed a law allowing significant reductions in the budget deficit.
Then appointed a task force to effect the necessary changes to the policies regarding public spending and taxes .
Last July, the working group has proposed to increase taxes (rather than cut spending) by removing the majority of exemptions in indirect taxes, among other things.
The new Congress led government of India also seems to promote these proposals . 
If Congress and the opposition parties are, they will help to support economic growth and to dispel the idea that democracies cannot take the necessary measures to encourage the development.

What is the problem with Turkey?
On 16 December, Orhan Pamuk, a famous authors Turks, will face a court in Istanbul. It should respond to accusations of "insult to the national identity" to be voted in favour of an open discussion on the genocide by the Turks to 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.
Pamuk incurred three years in prison.
Turkey's efforts to impose fines and jail terms to those who go beyond the official framework convince me that I had reason to oppose the opening of negotiations on the country's accession to the European Union.
In December 1999 , the European Council granted Turkey EU candidate status , which implied that Turkey would enter the Union at an undetermined future date . 
Then the council asked the European Commission to decide before October 2004 if Turkey met the necessary political criteria for membership , which include democracy , the rule of law and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities . 
This decision was one of the last taken by the Romano Prodi's Commission, which I was a member of.
Among its 30 members, 29 have said that Turkey sufficiently satisfied the criteria to be able to continue.
I was the only dissident.
It is the very report of the Commission on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, then in charge of EU enlargement, that motivated my decision.
This report stated that in 2003, approximately 21 870 Turks have sought asylum in the EU, of which 2 127 have been accepted.
In other words, the EU governments have themselves acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted over 2,000 of its own citizens.
Meanwhile, the commission published a progress report on Turkey stating that reforms were continuing, although at a slower pace, under the guidance of the moderate Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
This report was however state serious doubts human rights violations , including torture , state continuing , the military influence retained too much ; freedom state expression was not universally respected ; non Islamic state and cultural minorities were victims of discrimination and violence against state was not facing a sufficiently strong opposition . 
The situation has not changed much since the discussions on accession began in October.
Besides the persecution of which Pamuk is currently the victim , behaviour abound . 
In March 2005, the police violently intervened in a demonstration marking International Women's Day.
In May, the largest teaching union was banned for supporting the education of 14 million Kurds in Turkey in their own language.
It is undeniable that intolerance reaches is the highest heights of the Turkish government . 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul has recently abruptly cancelled a press conference in Copenhagen when he saw a Kurdish journalist in the public that Danes have refused to move out.
Such actions, such attitudes are largely my disagreement in October 2004.
But even if these problems were corrected, Turkey should not be admitted into the EU, because it is not an European country.
Christianity , féodalité , the Renaissance , the lights , democracy , and industrialisation have made us what we lights are , féodalité not so for lights Turks . 
So I am not sure that reforms in Turkey , implemented at the because of the European Commission , would be pursued after membership . 
I suspect even that there would be . 
In addition, Turkey's accession would lead to that of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
These first three countries are certainly more European than Turkey is.
Aside from the three Caucasus republics , but counting the États to Yugoslavia , this would mean an EU of some États states . 
What kind of union would it be?
The EU is not merely a club for friends.
It is founded on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people.
The Commission , as guardian of the Union treaties , must protect these four fundamental freedoms , which means that it must sometimes persuade , if necessary , force , member states to change their laws .
The policies on alcohol in Sweden , the Volkswagen Law in Germany and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that have made the commission unpopular . 
But they were necessary.
when I left the commission , I had to myself a stack of 1 , 500 findings of irregularities in this style .
In short, joining the EU means accepting incisive measures which deeply affect the internal affairs of a État.
It would be impossible with such disparate members.
The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls imperial . 
It would dilute in an unacceptable way.
This is why the former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's membership would lead to the end of the EU , and this is why the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said Turkey's accession would be more than the EU could bear . 
But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey's membership is a matter of democracy the majority of the population of the EU simply doesn't want to .

The crisis in Bolivia, a failure of Latin America.
Bolivia is far from being a typical Latin American . 
And if this was the turmoil of Haitian, this would be the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere: it is even less stable Haiti as its history and his two cents to État since its independence.
In a region in the indigenous strong past , at present fragmented and isolated , Bolivia is , perhaps , with Guatemala , the only Latin American countries where the indigenous peoples , represent the majority population .
Its topography and its ethnic distribution generate autonomous and even separatist forces that threaten the national unity in a much more provocative than anywhere else . 
And it is, of course, with Paraguay, the only country in the whole subcontinent denied access to the sea.
It would be imprudent to extrapolate the crisis in Bolivia to the rest of Latin America.
The extension would be far too simplistic at any , institutions are much extension , poverty , and particularly extreme poverty , has been extension , and struggles over ownership of natural resources have extension been settled . 
Even in countries such as Venezuela, which has huge reserves of oil and has a nationalist government with a traditional mind , the status quo had enabled the preservation of foreign investments during the almost eight years of government of President Hugo Chavez.
Even if the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from the Chiapas to the "Araucania", from the amazon to Ayacucho, they have never posed any real threat to the national integrity of any country in Latin America.
Thus, Bolivia is not a crisis an omen, nor the eternal ‘ domino theory, "which Lyndon Jonhson and Che guevarra believed both in the case of Bolivia, is valid or even partially reasonable.
However, the current crisis in Bolivia, points a finger at the "democratic deficit" afflicting Latin America.
The elected leaders have failure for one reason or another in Bolivia , Équateur failure Haiti . 
Democracy is weak or absent in Cuba, Mexico and Nicaragua, and is under threat for one reason or another in Venezuela and Colombia.
None of these cases is like the others they all comprise different degrees of risk , destruction reconciliation .
Is: what can be done against this, which contrasts strongly with the encouraging signs that prevailed until recent years.
At the last meeting of the American States Organization , which États held in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , the delegation États the United States has set a good idea provided by others États were simply cast because of his support . 
The story began two years earlier when Dante Caputo , former foreign minister from Argentina , and the UN Development Program UNDP were responsible for preparing a report on democracy in Latin America . 
Their findings showed an early-warning system of democracy in the region would help to generate some actions before any loss of control, such as Bolivia today.
Mr Caputo and the team of the UNDP had convinced Chile's President Ricardo Lagos to take care of the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues . 
What he has done without the initiative getting very far.
In fact , the UNDP report on democracy in Latin America , published in 2004 , hardly mentions death . 
The United States and the new Secretary General of the OAS , Jose Miguel Insulza , the during the OAS meeting in Florida , but she was killed by a reasonable of Latin Americans believe that s' is an action against Venezuela , coupled with anachronistic fears of Latinos on the violation of the sacrosanct of non intervention . 
Despite the fact that the continent agree on the principle , fact idea of an early warning system should be studied . 
Today, the Latin-American community probably has little possibility of any intervention into the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is dangerous for everyone.
Evo Morales , the opposition leader and of coca growers , may be an honest Democratic leader , though a unwise , but are his supporters all free of any authoritarian ? 
Hugo Chavez is perhaps not financing Mr . Morales and other Bolivian dissidents , but aren't Venezuela and Cuba tempted to meddle in the affairs of this country where Che Guevarra died at the head of the guerrilla almost 40 years earlier ? 
The business community of Santa Cruz in Bolivia does not perhaps give out its threat to secede , they prefer to share oil reserves and natural gas in their area with indigenous peoples rather than upland Brazilian industrialists in Sao Paulo ?
Before the events get out of , it might be good for the OAS and not the USA to get involved . 
The region continues to need such participation in term time , message , and appropriate democratic platform participation distinct term the traditional American intervention and the usual participation of term America .

The decline of France?
The French are notoriously susceptible , not to say on the defensive about the scale of France abroad . 
The French state spends a substantial sum to the spread state language and French culture sum but the French are painfully state that their sum global position is not what state was . 
In this context, not surprisingly, in the last presidential elections, the publication of a European Commission report saying that the economic status of France among European countries had passed the 3
The OECD and Eurostat , the European body with gathering these data , believed they had put body end to this aspect of the debate by demonstrating body France , Germany , Italy and Britain levels had life identical per capita of . 
But on a larger scale the controversy has not disappeared.
Worried concern on the French decline have reappeared with the allegations concern held this year against pension reform , the allegations differences on fiscal policy with the European Commission and allegations concern with America on the war in Iraq . 
The most successful romancé fiction book in France at the moment is a romancé written by Nicolas Baverez , The Fall of France . 
Baverez's book of is full of quotes from de Gaulle and Napoleon.
According to the author , France's latest achievements back to 1970 1970s with the high speed train , the TGV , and Airbus . 
It strongly both Mitterrand and Chirac with a same talent to win the elections and to make France a loser . 
The success of the book is itself a sign of "unease".
But what kind?
Evidence of degeneration brought about by Baverez is not convincing he wants us to believe .
For example , he cites the depletion of industrial jobs as the more dramatic declines of France's . 
But result industrialization is a common to all advanced countries . 
Indeed , France obtained much better results than most of its rich neighboring competitors , unlike Germany , the UK or US , it has maintained the same world market share in the industrial sector that it owned in the early 1970s .
Also , according to a more precise competitiveness and foreign investment , France has excellent results in these areas . 
According to a recent report published by the Council of Economic Analysis , direct investments in France rose to 60 billion in 2001 , almost twice as much as in Germany . 
The French competitive cost has also improved (20%) in the past three decades, with higher productivity counterbalancing the rapid growth in wages.
But the heart of France's long term term problems actually lies in the fear of losing industrial jobs . 
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional sectors such as automotive and aerospace , but has lagged in innovative markets in which businesses disseminate new technologies . 
France , for example , spends only 30 billion per year in research and development on advanced technologies , versus 51 billion in dollars , 98 billion in Japan , and 265 billion in the United States . 
In short , Baverez's analysis pointed in the wrong direction .
France has undertaken several major reforms over the past two decades: economic and financial liberalisation, the elimination of price and exchange rate controls, the end of restrictions on credit, European liberalisation, reducing inflationary and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced globalisation of companies in the country.
The French malaise was certainly not caused by these reforms.
The problem of France is just that she has failed to recognize the new world that she is already part of.
French capitalism is dead and France can't come to accept it's disappearance.
France must be the only country where a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, felt obliged to apologise after saying on television that "the state is not omnipotent."
There are several reasons for this French schizophrenia , but the most important of these the of the past 20 years . 
Until 1981 , France was clearly divided between right and left . 
Since that period , the Mitterrand and Chirac administrations downplayed their period order to implement the difficult process of adaptation to Europe and globalisation . 
A "shock therapy" to the SRM. Thatcher two decades ago could forge a new political consciousness.
But the slow move consensual of reforms allowed the French to live move one world and think in another . 
This is largely the political upheaval that exploded in the last presidential campaign, when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has reached the second round of presidential elections in the outgoing Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
The rise of the extreme left, which has won 10% of votes in this presidential campaign, also attests to this political failure.
France needs a political revolution more than an economic revolution, if it wants to come to accept reality, including the fact that French "decline" is a fear created by the French people.

The value of the European values 
European leaders have resumed on the constitutional issues that had ended in December following a dispute on voting rights . 
These debates naturally lead to compromise, which will be soon.
Still in of clear are goals supposed of the constitution . 
Two fundamental principles have led to European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.
These two principles are at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology and the law.
For years, they were an integral part of the legal and institutional structure of the European Union, in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which the quote in the preamble) and in the recent draft constitution.
In short, they are registered in the history and ideals of the EU.
But what is the real significance of these two principles?
Let's consider solidarity , which lends itself to two interpretations at least static solidarity , which concerns solely the distribution of income and wealth , and the wider concept of dynamic solidarity dynamics which concerns the production of income and wealth . 
In the history of post war European integration , momentum solidarity strongly manifested during the first period , especially in the European Coal and Steel Community , both in its economic development strategy reconstruction in the treaties , particularly the Treaty of Rome . 
This does not mean that the dynamic solidarity was subsequently removed the European monetary union , for dynamic , perfectly expresses this . 
And , although some countries were not immediately benefited from the euro , they accepted it because they were convinced that it would have positive effects on the long term .
In other words , dynamic means means promoting policies that encourage investment , innovation , means growth and employment . 
However , as indicated by the growth of GNP in the EU , solidarity momentum has been undermined over the last decade . 
The gap between research and development is particularly worrying.
The implementation of the so-called Lisbon strategy, adopted by the EU in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by the growing importance attached to solidarity, reflected in the high costs of social aid and the high taxes needed to finance them.
The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population which, together with sluggish growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances.
One of the greatest challenges posed to the EU is to treat the predominance of static solidarity , which is geared towards the elderly, at the expense of solidarity dynamics, which encourages young people.
After all, the Union cannot allow current consumption to keep winning over the investment needed for future prosperity.
subsidiary is similar to the concept of solidarity in that subsidiary interpretation is twofold vertical and horizontal subsidiarity . 
Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution power among different levels of government and sovereignty the power , national member , regions , and municipalities . 
The best known of this principle is federalism . 
European treaties clearly express this vertical subsidiarity.
But is this enough to encompass the canvas institutional and constitutional of the Union ? 
The horizontal subsidiarity is the responsibility and freedom of human beings and on the social and economic powers.
It encompasses relations between the state, society and the market.
But company and the market have their own rights and their company states that are not granted by the state company 
the next problem arises how to ensure the autonomy of each kingdom ?
An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the internal European market , which created a new type of economic freedom and increased competition among companies by eliminating the protection of national governments . 
Horizontal subsidiarity means that in society and in the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected at the highest possible level.
It also implies that a higher power has to provide its support each time freedom individual responsibility are not sufficient for achieving the objectives necessary for human dignity .
This support, however, must be allowed in ways that promotes the natural potential of individuals, society and the market.
But this is possible only if the role of the horizontal subsidiarity is clearly stated , which was not the case in the european treaties , the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights or the work of the European Convention . 
In short, solidarity is today a redistribution rather than a growth (the current generation expressed solidarity with future generations) whereas the subsidiary is the distribution of political power rather than a cautious of the borders between the state, civil society and the market.
At the moment , these two values are set in a that favors the State . 
In , the emphasis placed on growth oriented towards the market has often been identified with the semi strange values of America . 
But these values are deeply rooted in Europe and they must be uprooted anew.
The EU must restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity more balanced in favour of the market and society , which would reduce the socio economic impact of the state . 
Public institutions must produce assets such as defence , justice and fiscal and monetary policy , company offer services goods such as culture , education and helping the needy and the market must produce goods related to profits , growth and employment . 
In the 21st century Europe must review the value of these two principles (solidarity and subsidiarity) if it wants to achieve the goal of integration: freedom and prosperity needed to overcome differences and the political divisions that led to the tragedies in the 20th century.
This is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be drawn up.

The politics of values
The debate about U . S . elections has still not abated . 
How could President George W. Bush get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and offer a Republican majority in both houses of Congress?
There is little on the answers , but there are two recurring themes in many explanations . 
One of these issues lies in his personality.
In our time full of uncertainty and threatening, people have put their trust in a president they knew rather than in a candidate who has not yet delivered.
The second is that of values.
The people voted for a set of values rather than for specific people . 
Indeed , some one would say agree with Kerry's policies but gave their vote to Bush because they felt comfortable with the whole of his attitude .
It is clear that the U . S . is now deeply divided about the electoral . 
An of ark blue Democrat , at the East , North and West stretches around a ark blue zone Republican at the centre and the South ark 
Beyond the geographical division, the divisions recur at the local level.
Gerrymandering , the practice of of retraçage borders to favor one political expense retraçage borders , is no longer needed . 
Voters tend to be moved into areas where the majority of people share their values, whether Republican or Democrat.
What are these values, exactly?
These are the values that deal , from what they tell us , with God , guns and . 
Religion plays a role , especially with biblical truths in the history of creation . 
The possession of a weapon is the ultimate test of individualism and the use of weapons in times of war is not obscene.
Gays and other modern practices are rejected as narsicisstic . 
As the political scientist Andrew Hacker said recently , The Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million a chance to feel good about themselves . 
Is all this an American phenomenon, or there are other trends elsewhere?
One answer is that as an American phenomenon , the politics of values may command a majority now today but is by no case . 
Europe and other parts of the world are divided in the same way.
Personality undoubtedly matters , and under the obvious political differences one also questions of values that have not yet been highlighted . 
However , traditional political policies based on disagreement over core values play a policies in elections . 
The Prime Minister Tony Blair , for example , another leader facing an election in his country , plays the personality card and talks about policies , he primarily represents a set of middle class values .
When he speaks of modernisation or entering the 21st century , he manages to suggest a strange but attractive of change and stability . 
This leaves the conservative opposition without any effective response.
Even the issues of tax cuts and asylum stricter fail to fly on the strings of the melody of values that the Republican party has managed to make the États-unis.
The situation is similar in Germany, where the overt influence values politics is even smaller.
The debate, in Germany, is still mostly a political debate.
When the opposition gives the government to negotiate the welfare reform or, more recently, to combat unemployment, the underlying challenge is not in terms of values, but instead of competence.
, on the traditional battlefields of English or German political debate , and elsewhere in Europe , clashes of values threaten to occur .
The parties are fighting for those who can feel comfortable in their own place , but they perhaps do not understand very well that this is only partly a political policy . 
Religion will never be an important factor in European politics: opinion polls show that religious practice remains one of the rare, significant differences between Americans and Europeans.
The weapons also occupy a place in the minds of Europe: it is their absence that Europeans see as important.
Europe was no doubt well-versed in pacifist values.
And the question of politically correctness the gay also plays a less important role so far correctness Europe . 
Above all , Europe itself divides Europeans , for the national issue is present in all États . 
It is a question of values inspired by fear.
People want to know where they stand and , in the wake , will turn against the United and towards Europe or against Europe and towards their own . 
ways , we are leaving the kingdom of policies and even ways , and are entering the nightmarish area marécageux symbols and ways . 
Which , in any case , represents the main that danger democracies face , because the of values is a danger development . 
It reintroduced fundamental divisions of a society whose greatest democratic democracy was precisely to banish fundamentalism from political life . 
An informed public debate must be a discussion on the policies contained in a community of values.
So it is essential to insist on this important goal of the policy of freedom.

The advent of interest
One swallow does not bring spring and a single month of growth of employment and price rises in the US does not mean that the Federal Reserve does not fear more unease and deflation.
But the time will come when the global interest rates will begin to increase as central bankers are preparing to resist the tide of rising inflation.
When that time comes , whether this autumn , in 2005 or 2006 , or even in 2007 , America and the global economy will have to deal with financial vulnerabilities reflecting the success of the last three years of monetary stimulus by arresting the decline in production and by curbing unemployment . 
The short-term interest rates are surprisingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the United States and zero in Japan.
The monetary expansionist policy proved a success , but only after having brought interest rates down to historically low levels having convinced investors that borrowing costs would remain at their current levels for a long time .
The stimulus has mostly resulted in an in assets everything that produces a benefit , a dividend , or assets becomes much more attractive , and therefore much more valuable assets terms , when interest rates remain very low assets 
This explains the huge differentiation between the current price of real estate in the United States, the ordinary shares in New York, London and Frankfurt, and the obligations on the long term anywhere in the world and what should be, conventionally, their core values.
What will happen when central banks begin to raise their interest rates?
In 1994 , rising interest rates in the short term has resulted in higher rates over the long term and lower obligations in the long term at least twice that size by models standard this year . 
Interest rates in peripheral developing economies have also increased much more than the rate in the major advanced industrial countries . 
The first danger for 2005 and for the coming years, when the global interest rates will increase, as it is likely, is another wave of financial crises of the emerging markets.
For countries such as Mexico , Brazil , Turkey , Argentina , Korea , Malaysia Thailand , the decade of the 1990s demonstrates that differences in interest rates may rise capital flows may reverse course remarkably rapidly , regardless of the degree of benevolence with which the representatives of the IMF the analysis performed by the major banks consider the policies of a country .
Differences among interest rates in emerging markets are currently abnormally low.
currency monetary markets , capital inflows to the United States excepted , currency markets yet at levels associated with irrational currency markets but there are of this happening before interest rates currency markets climb . 
This is alarming because if there is one lesson to take away from the 1990s , it is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows . 
The second danger comes from high values in the major advanced industrial countries . 
The dominant way of thinking within the Federal Reserve, which I fully support, argues that the information technology revolution continues, that the potential output in the US is still growing very quickly and that the output gap is relatively high.
This means that interest rates will certainly remain low for a relatively long period.
In addition , confidence in the Federal Reserve is high , and the last vestiges of the inflation risk premium of the 1970s no longer have any interest rates . 
Therefore , even after production levels have returned to their previous level , interest rates remain low by the standards of the 1980s and 1990s . 
All of this is evidently good news for those who hold assets such as long term bonds , stock and real property . 
Indeed, the rising prices of active on the long term was precisely what the lower interest rates had hoped: make the bondholders, and particularly property owners, richer and give after all a boost to spending.
But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for some time, they will not stay this low indefinitely.
The key is that when interest rates rise, the values of assets fall.
It is during these periods , especially when the assets values fall quickly and significantly , that we discover the full extent of our central bankers's in their main task to reduce financial volatility and promote economic stability . 
It is also during these periods that we discover how individuals who hold bonds in the long term, property or shares have them not because they believe current prices are reasonable compared to basic prices, but because their prices have risen in recent years.
It is a crucial issue for policymakers , because people who bought stocks for the long term because prices seemed to be increasing indefinitely are the also ones who will sell as soon as the trend seems to reverse itself . 
Specifically , the trade deficit the US heralds a mass instability if asset prices in the long term should mass dramatically . 
It is certain that the challenges facing the world's economic policy makers in over the coming years will differ from those they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ . 
The associated risks with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by falling production and the threat of deflation.
But, as we have learned during the 1990s, that does not mean that the challenges ahead will be easier to resolve.

The opposing futures of America.
I recently discovered an interesting American economists who are involved in international finance and macroeconomists macro economists who are concerned with the domestic economy have very different perspectives in , opposing on the possible consequences of the huge US deficit . 
International finance economists consider that a financial crisis is possible , followed by a painful and possibly prolonged recession in the United States . 
The macroeconomists dealing with the domestic economy instead see a further fall in the dollar's value not as a crisis but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.
The macroeconomists economists who examined the domestic economy generally regard situation macroeconomists as follows at a time in the future , macroeconomists foreign central banks will be less inclined to pursue macroeconomists massive purchases of securities in dollars to support the macroeconomists . 
When they will put an end to programmes dollars scale dollar purchase , the programmes of the dollar will fall , and it will programmes sharply . 
And, at this point of view, if the value of the dollar declines, the American exports will become much more attractive to foreign markets and the employment market in America will resume, labor being redirected to the new export industries in the boom.
The situation will be comparable to that of Britain when it abandoned its index of exchange rates and let the pound Sterling depreciate against the German mark , or what happened to the United States at the end of the 1980s when the dollar depreciated against the pound , the mark and especially against the Japanese yen . 
international finance economists describe a gloomier future.
They sthink that the end of programmes to buy dollars on a large scale by central banks programmes not only lead to the dollar decline but also to programmes soaring rate of American interests in the long term programmes which will depress household consumption , and will regulate programmes spending after a short time . 
Certainly , economists in international finance also as well that American exports will benefit from the fall of the dollar , but the lag in demand is such that the surge in exports will only happen a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending . 
Eight to ten million people will leave the services sector and the construction sector import the export export of goods , implying that structural unemployment will increase . 
, there might be a financial panic the large financial institutions with short term obligations and long term assets will have difficulties to support a strong rise in long term interest rates denominated in dollars .
The cause of inequality can lead to a certain tension and a bankruptcy just as easily as those caused crises in Mexico and Asia in the 1990s or Argentina this decade of active in local currency and the dollar bonds that held the banks.
When international finance economists highlight this scenario , the macroeconomists who specialize in economy claim that it sounds like a case incompetence incompetent monetary scenario . 
Why should the Federal Reserve allow the rise in long-term interest rates when the foreign central banks will end their programmes to buy dollars?
Then it not then intervene and take over by buying US Treasury bond in the long term , maintaining long term interest rates at a satisfactory level to promote full employment ?
Economists of international finance generally respond that the Federal Reserve does not have the ability to do so.
Forced to choose between full employment and price stability, according to them, the Federal Reserve will choose prices stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970s and of the soaring inflation remains very powerful.
So , since the fall in value of the dollar raise the of import which works as a negative shock on the supply side in the economic sector , the Federal Reserve will increase and not cut its interest rates and therefore sell rather than buying government bonds . 
Serious economists  that I have great respect for are taking a stand on opposite sides of this debate.
I am not enough to give reason to one or other, but I know no doubt which side I hope to see wrong.

The worst performers in Europe 
In the US , states with misguided fiscal policies are penalised . 
Their obligations are selling on the cheap compared to other better managed states.
The service the debt higher than they should pay point to a degree of disciplinary action against the temptation to spend today and pay later.
Of course , market discipline is not perfect the bond market won't see the future implicit liabilities such as promised payments pensions 
However , the application of this fiscal discipline , combined with the internal budget process of each state , prevented the occurrence of the greatest fiscal crisis in the U . S . since the Great Depression . 
Let's consider the case of Europe.
Before the advent of the euro , many États in southern Europe were undergoing fiscal crises , producing waves États high inflation . 
But with the introduction of the single currency , way allowing a fiscal crisis to be solved by inflation has been blocked , since the European Central Bank ECB oversees monetary policy . 
However , even if nations can no longer rely on inflation to address their financial finances , the single currency allows them to use the ability which actually belongs to other members of the European Union to extend their spending boom and push away their political responsibility during let the good roll periods time 
It is to avoid this possibility that the EU has created the stability and growth pact: the budget deficit of governments must not exceed 3% of GDP.
Last week, the German government, once the European country, the most prudent and disciplined in the fiscal, broke the rules of the pact for the fifth consecutive year, without really (many) of excuses.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has indicated that he expected the European Commission to apply sanctions against Germany the credibility of the pact would , he said , jeopardy if no action does was done . 
Thus , Germany would not block sanctions that time , as was the case two and a half years ago . 
But Steinbrueck has also made clear he only expected a purely symbolic sanctions in response to the budget deficit of 3 . 4 of GDP , and no penalties that would have a true cost of his government or his economy . 
The growth and stability pact is not, or not yet, working as planned at the start.
What about market discipline?
Is the will of the German government to increase its debt and increase its deficits limited by the fact that the market recognizes and penalizes nations that let their fiscal position erode?
In a word, no.
Interest rates on euro denominated sovereign debt of the euro zone area governments are very similar . 
The market doesn't seem to care that countries have different potential generate export fund the financial flow funds to potential debts , or deficit current or projected potential to GDP ratios . 
Willem Buiter, the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert, from London University, estimates that it is the acceptance of the ECB to all the deficit in the eurozone as a guarantee that has undermined the will of the market to become the controller of fiscal restraint.
As part of German marginal debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan, or as a centrepiece of an operation of pension fought to acquire liquidity, its value is more likely to be determined by the terms under which the ECB accepts it as a guarantee that its fundamental.
The ECB's treatment of such debt is equally powerful as a source of liquidity reserve now trumps any analysis of in long term sovereign term . 
It is dangerous in the long term.
It is necessary to have both a market discipline and a sound fiscal management for a reasonable chance to benefit from price stability over the long term.
Omit now for the market that may become reckless or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations , and you are liable to suffer serious consequences maybe not today not tomorrow , but someday , and for the rest of your life . 
time passes , the arrival of the single currency , and how the euro has been put in place are generating an increasing unease .
The policy of the entire Euro area in general is too deflationary.
The transfers necessary to render the current anathema bearable for regions in a or anathema in recession when the ECB applies a more anathema policy have not been facts . 
The institutional foundations of a fiscal policy stable over the long term are being eroded.
Now , Buiter and Sibert convince us that the ECB gives the market less opportunity to reward the most economical and penalises the spenders it shouldn't .
The land isn't moving yet , and it won't happen for a land moment 
But the soil under the euro may well begin to ice if things soil not change .

Milosevic and Hussein same trial , even farce 
trial of war criminals were once serious business . 
Remember the photographs of the sinister Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess on the dock at Nuremberg.
Some of the Nazi leaders were hung after a relatively short, but fair, trial.
Nowadays , the trial of the most abject atrocities of the world trial become farcical . 
The trial of Saddam Hussein and his friends of Baath are an uninterrupted series of embarrassing moments.
The defendants are trying one bit of monkey business another and Hussein makes all possible displays of contempt . The only thing he hasn't done yet , is to moon the judge .
It is difficult to expect an outcome that could seem legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.
Meanwhile , Slobodan Milosevic's trial changed into a funeral after four boring years of accounts and 200 million spent unnecessarily . 
In Cambodia , the United Nations and the government have stalled for nearly ten years to know how to get the senior Khmer Rouge survivors before courts . 
The mass murderers who seized power in the twentieth century were doomed to be killed in popular revolts or tried for their crimes at least they did not die in office .
Who could be proud that the last Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, in Romania, was shot with his wife without even the appearance of a fair trial?
The formal trappings of a real court are always better than instant justice, even if the final result is also death.
Today there are two plausible to proceed with regards to a deposed dictator . 
A nation can send its former leaders to court , did the Argentinians in the 1980s with the generals responsible for the loss of more than 5 , 000 of their fellow citizens .
At the international level , the model of Nuremberg remains valid for serving an example for other trial , although under the conditions admit that the victorious powers sometimes ask for certain crimes , as the crimes against humanity , which are not properly defined at the moment when they are committed . 
There was a time where you could see the benefits trial both domestic and international . 
The trial on national territory allowed the local community to give trial to its grief part participating closely to the trial . 
Much like judges and fellow impartial defendants countrymen could also bring greater sensitivity fellow estimate defendants guilt because they could assess the fellow conditions under defendants a deposed dictator makes his decisions . 
The trial of the generals in Argentina has been a successful ritual as part of the painful transition from the military junta to democracy , but this experiment ended in larmoyante tearful question . 
Even after their condemnation , the generals have been strong enough to demand condemnation denunciation of their trial followed by an amnesty for the condemnation president . 
Argentinian enchevêtrée is still embroiled in the legal consequences of these trials from 20 enchevêtrée ago . 
At international level, the decision of the UN Security Council to establish the international criminal tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICC) has also been welcomed with great confidence.
The ICC has taken several fundamental foundation under the direction of Antonio Cassese . 
But the judges had the misfortune to realise their most cherished dream to judge the chief , Slobodan Milosevic . 
We cannot get a clear idea of how the Serbs would have judged Milosevic within the of a local trial . 
Many would have depended on the political party that would have controlled the court.
At the international level , fears were not of excess much politics but of too much law excess 
The Milosevic trial had to be more than fair, it had to be the emblem of UN justice.
As such , Milosevic was allowed to defend himself a serious error in terms of length and efficiency of the trial . 
There was no limits the number of people that charge called limits testify on the same dreadful story of the Serb aggression limits brutality . 
It will take many months to determine the problem and to know why this scandal of a four years trial . 
My hunch is that the well intentions officials of the court were too influenced by the intentions and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa , a model sold intentions schools of law as a desirable to fairness intentions . 
During trial African , the most important issue was not trial future of the defendant but the of the victims . 
Each victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant was listening.
In the case of twentieth century massacres , narrations can endure for decades . 
Encouraging victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to hog the floor and trial mounting his merits a political leader are the ingredients of an interminable session . 
One of the lessons learned by the of trial and Hussein is that one should not prosecute trial or women in to make them appeal less trial . 
They will subvert the trial, particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves, and use the courtroom to justify their journey.
Tyrants should not be judged having been clearly defeated .
Ironically , the fact that the Nuremberg was chaired by representatives of the prevailing was an advantage . 
They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess and their henchmen that allies where the Nazis were fatally vanquished.
Punishing the perpetrators , rather than shaping how history is written , has always been the clear goal of the trial . 
The tragedy of the trial and Hussein is that the points on the 'I' trial history are still missing and that history story trial on the . 
hesitation has resulted birth proceedings , both national and international hesitation which have birth in fantasies of justification and hesitation return 
In the case of Saddam Hussein , this fantasy could yet become .

The dividing line of the Iraqi economy
All those who study Iraq see a nation divided between the communities of Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds.
But there is split equally important division , a division that contributes to the continued split as well as the sectarian conflict and the opposition to split military occupation led by the Americans , that of the growing split between rich and poor in Iraq . 
When Iraq was liberated, the people, especially the poor people, were led to hope that a charismatic leader would rescue them from the harsh realities of daily life.
Raised in fear , they had no idea about how democracy could apply to their society how the groups in defense of human rights and other civil rights organizations could help them to shape their future .
Iraq has quickly found a new line of social shares.
On one side were those who understood how to operate in a democracy, come to power and attain appropriate ambitions.
They have learned to speak the language of democracy , to earn money and influence at the same time , and to enlist independent organisations to defend their rights and privileges . 
On the other side , however , there is a vast population of Iraqis without power , especially women widows , divorced or abandoned without anyone to take of them and their children . 
For them, democracy and Human Rights do not mean much.
They are uncultivated, poor and sick.
Victims of an education system that collapsed more than ten years ago , education have insufficiently trained to find employment in an Iraqi economy that is education away . 
Under the yoke of Saddam, no effort was made to raise living standards for the poor.
I visited big Iraqi slums and discovered families living in homes barely covered by a roof , infested with insects everywhere , with open sewers running under their doors . 
Day and night , they live in the . 
No need for nothing more than food , housing , decent and prospects for jobs , these families face the death , terrifiées by the cries of their hungry children . 
When I met women who live in these homes , they were being bombarded with questions did democracy give them food and houses 
Will democracy stop men from beating their wives?
Democracy it give citizenship to their children ? 
Would it give them the right to divorce the spouses who would have abandoned them?
À all of these questions , I replied yes . 
Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent home, the right to learn and work, and it will grant citizenship to children and equality between men and women.
But you must work hard and make every effort to demand these rights.
To which they replied: "Saddam has taught us to be unemployed, silent and fearful for 35 years".
"What can we do now?"
In these indiginous areas where most Iraqis live, people are prey to the bitter temptations.
There are many who are beyond the scope of political and government leaders . 
They fall easily into violence, theft and sabotage.
The poverty leads some to accept money in exchange for terrorist acts , rendered collusion by the promise of false heroism that they could not use during the long reign of Saddam . 
Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of the violent history of wars and atrocities in Iraq , sensitivity have desensitized people to murder . 
Although the current living conditions in today lead many young men to violence , I am today that we need only to providing them with jobs and decent today to save them . 
Jobs , in particular , would help young people to build new lives through real . 
Dummy posts should not be used to disguise the army of unemployed . 
We must give people jobs that allow them to contribute positively to the reconstruction of the country.
By nature , individual seeks to prove his to society individual 
But the culture that Saddam Hussein created convinced the Iraqis that political connections are the only way of acquiring authority, money and knowledge.
Overcoming such sentiments will take time and will require a booming economy , which suggests that the new Iraqi government should have limited powers to encourage private sector growth while promoting widespread understanding of democracy and human rights . 
Religious groups are ready to participate in this process.
We can also restore the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they too have a chance to serve their country.
point but not least , we must provide loans to point families to help them build a respectable life for themselves . 
The government must above all make every effort to convince the Iraqi people of the value of democracy and freedom and the importance of the Constitution in achieving their aspirations for a better life.
It will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people believe that to violate the law is an act of heroism.
We have yet, we, the Iraqis, learned that the power should not be concentrated in the hands of a minority, and that the establishment of justice needs to fight corruption in all forms.
If the constitution is to operate as a guarantee of democracy , freedom , and security , suppressed Iraqis must learn to fight their fight .

The Islamist identity
Wherever you direct your gaze at the moment , Islam is used and misused as a political force . 
Some Muslims use it as a incentives to ; many Muslims in the West and incentives other countries see it as an other containment an incentives exclusion . 
As a Turk, I directly feel these two sides of the debate.
The reason why Islam seems like such an alien of religion in the eyes of is that the West has participated in deinstitutionalisation of religion . 
It is not religion that has disappeared from modern Western life , of course , but rather the that religious institutions can issue on the behaviour of the individual . 
Religion in the modern world is more than ever a personal and spiritual experience.
However , a process of de institutionalization of religious is also happening in Islam . 
The politicization of Islam supersedes the authority of the religious classes of Islam, the ulema.
As in the West, the Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal.
The interpretation of religious texts by Muslims, including political activists and intellectuals and women, is a consequence.
include the extension of religious knowledge , the teachings of the Koran being mistreated and taken out of context to support political objectives .
Who now decides what is legitimate and what is illicit in Islam?
Who has the authority necessary to interpret religious texts?
Who may issue a fatwa or declare "jihad"?
Nowadays, activism and terrorism provide, or rather impose, a source of legitimacy.
It is so that the laity decide what does or does not mean Islam , without the authority of faith schools and specialized training .
Indeed, today's Islam is essentially interpreted by politicians and cultural movements, and not by religious institutions.
This enabled the deinstitutionalisation institutionalization of Islam to move status being a local deinstitutionalisation national ties to a status of links deinstitutionalisation all Muslims around the who feel status or displaced . 
Islam can unite adherents who were deeply divided the Sufi Muslim scholars and the Muslims of Shariat origin ; the Shiite Muslims and the Sunni ; conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran .
Islam is equally dynamic, its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including Western cities.
Many see this as a and stress that these individuals are socially adrift and in the alienation and , for some , terrorism . 
But social mobility is also a prerequisite for creating a modern outlook.
course , migration causes a sense of distance among Muslims course if not a complete break , from their social groups . 
Their religious experience is new, private institutions theological, community or public.
The religious experience becomes a form of social imagination in which they rebuild a sense of belonging to Islam in an environment which is both new and strange.
It is not the distance from modern life, but rather the proximity to this life that triggers a return to the religious identity.
Indeed , the vast majority of radicalism manifests itself in groups which , judging by their experience of mobility and trip , are familiar with secular Western of political and urban . 
Confused by an unfamiliar stranger , these people cling to Islam , who becomes stranger sole support people 
But for that support to functions , Islam should free itself from its traditionally functions , passive and submissive attitude in the of modernity . 
By wearing a veil or a beard, claiming the right to have places of prayer at work or school and requiring special food, Muslims openly identify themselves as Muslims.
They inform the whole world that they are more zealous and more meticulous in their religious observance than individuals who confine their religiosity to private privacy . 
For example , non Muslims generally consider the wearing of the veils to be a sign of the administration and inferior inferiority of Muslim women . 
Shame, however, it is changed to Muslims, a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity.
Young Muslim women in Europe perfectly extent this transformation . 
The headscarves who wear in French and German schools are , headscarves many ways namely , the youth culture , the headscarves of fashion and the language , more similar to their headscarves than to their uneducated mothers who are forced to headscarves at home . 
By wearing the headscarf in the European public sphere, these girls are unwittingly the symbol and role of Muslim women.
This trend goes far beyond simple headscarves.
All the Muslims in the West have a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.
They define themselves by their religiosity, but they have also acquired universal secular knowledge.
The fact that they have the cultural capital, they can move relatively freely between the different activities and spaces (homes, schools, homes for young and space for leisure district).
Being a Muslim and being a Islamist are two different things.
We are witnessing today the of a Muslim identity to an Islamic identity . 
The religious view for Muslim passes from the private into view . 
The question that remains for everyone is whether this quest for identity can be satisfied with scarves and a broad public acceptance of Islamist religious practice or if a positive affirmation of Islam requires a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.

A new era for the Islamic science?
For several hundred years , while science and mathematics went through a period of great ingenuity , one region of the world distinguished itself from the others . 
The masters of these disciplines were revered , medicine was advancing by and and people were now contemplating the workings of nature . 
It is no surprise that this region has been respected globally.
In the other of the known world , scientists were punished , even killed . 
irréligieuses , considered irreligious and foreign , existed outside the , and was later made irréligieuses to religion . 
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous area was the Islamic Middle East , while an ignorant Europe remained poor . 
Both regions were religiously governed historians differ about the role and nature of religions in this context , but science flourished épanouissait only one of them . 
Today, obviously, the roles of the Islamic Middle East and of the West are reversed.
Since the Second World War , the United States are the undisputed global leaders in the of science . 
Throughout this period, the brightest students were lured away from their home countries by the prospect of better career and research opportunities.
Until recently , more than half of students graduating with high in math , science and engineering in the United States were born abroad . 
Many of these young talents remained after receiving their diplomas, and both the industrial world that the government have benefited.
Meanwhile, Islamic culture walked into a historical period in which science was comparable to the influence of the West, and shunned for this same reason.
Even in countries where oil revenue could fund a significant proportion of the research , Arab leaders have not encouraged such investments , and the result is that their societies have not prospered as much so they could have . 
Recently , a desire for greater political policy has led Islamic nations to invest in technology policy which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian policy ambitions . 
But while such weapons have a political clout, the science on which they rest is banal and old.
The respect that comes from visions well thought out, rather than those born of past discoveries, is far more significant.
Imagine the effect that a Pakistani institute would have at the head effect global research into cancer . 
will the political rhetoric change if researchers in Oman find a way to eliminate AIDS ?
This moment does not present itself for now . 
But there exists another, which is not confined to Islamic societies.
The United States has committed serious stumbles recently . 
"issues of faith" have substituted for science among government, from the presidency.
Leading researchers have seen their reports modified by members of the staff policy when the facts contradicted the official version . 
Encouraged by a administration influenced by religion , school systems are shifting administration teaching science to values . 
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, the entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, which hinders the flow of young talent to American universities.
The large scientific scientists have protested to no avail . 
Meanwhile, tax laws have been revised to make investors richer in the short term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half a trillion dollars were spent in the war in Iraq , an amount roughly equal to the funding of all fundamental research of the last thousand years . 
Even if the United States avoids a dark age of fundamentalism , they are clearly at of losing their world domination in terms of research . 
Japan has recognized the link between political weight and science in the 1980s.
The main , industrial Japanese , Akio Morita , CEO of Sony , and the right wing politician Shinzo Ishihara , made a series of speeches that have been compiled and released in 1986 , under the The Japan that Can Say No . 
They outlined a national strategy in which global influence would result from scientific science . 
The main idea is that military power could be made obsolete if "food chain" of military technology was controlled by other nations.
The title of the book refers to the goal of Japan to say no to the American military influence Japan masters the main military technologies .
Building a knowledge based economy on thanks of oil wealth is entirely possible . 
Texas , for example , like most of the États south of the United States , was once economically poor and États the decline . 
Even with oil revenues , the flow of dollars in the economy , is not enough in itself to boost prosperity much one might think .
Texas has therefore decided to dedicate the oil money to provide funding for education.
Today, this budget is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and it extends to 15 universities.
It had a staggering effect the aerospace industry has almost disappeared from California , it booming in Texas .
The research centres and telecommunications companies have rushed to Texas , centres the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel . 
Although the industry is in crisis in the United States , Texas has one of the strongest economies in the world . 
There is no reason that the same results could not be achieved in the Middle East.
But first , the Islamic world needs to rediscover and make with its proud heritage .

The Iranian debate on Iraq.
No country in the East is following the events in postwar Iraq as closely as Iran.
Geographic proximity, intense and violent war with Iraq from Saddam Hussein, religious and emotional connections with the Shia in Iraq, some concern about the États-unis and their policy in the region: this is the son that unite Iran in its western neighbor.
Given tension never end with America , Iran is particularly tension by end possibility of a continued American presence in tension neighbour , as end as by the dominant role of America tension the end of future future post Saddam Iraq . 
Foreign observers may find it difficult to follow the internal discussions in Iran , yet they exist , they are intense , even if they are not always visible to the international audience in general . 
We can identify three general approaches in the evolving debate in Iran about post Saddam Iraq . 
Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran will inevitably have to cooperate with the USA in post Saddam Iraq even if only to ensure that the rights of the Shiite population of Iraq are respected . 
For this reason , Iran would be assurance that the new Iraqi leader is not assurance to him and even attempt bilateral friendship . 
Other key considerations for the pragmatists the preservation of territorial integrity of Iraq and the repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran . 
They are moderates who believe that the Iranian government should insist that the États unis secure the extradition of members of the Organization of moudjahidins Khalq MKO , based in Iraq , and the dismantling of the organisation . 
In exchange, the Iranian government should offer its support to ensure peace, stability, and security in Iraq.
In sum , the pragmatists would limit relationship US Iranian , concentrating on programme that relationship reflects the concerns inside Iran . 
In general, the conservative forces of Iran support this approach.
Another approach is proposing a more active and cooperative role for Iran in Iraq's reconstruction . 
Advocates of this position argue that Iran is well placed to facilitate the reconstruction because of its well established infrastructure of personal and institutional with Iraq . 
Finally , it thinks , the United States and the international community recognize the value of Iranian cooperation . 
The Iranian cooperation should be rewarded by the dismantling of the MKO's infrastructure in Iraq, perhaps in exchange for a promise that Iran would tackle the activities of Al Qaeda and expel members of Al Qaeda in Iran.
Above all, Iran should urge Americans to meet its cooperation with the assurance of a guarantee in return that Iran does not become the target of US military actions.
In short , advocates of cooperation are calling for open and explicit support from Iran to ensure stability during the current transition phase , and its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with the entire permanent government that will emerge in Iraq , in exchange for improved regional and international relations with Iran . 
This position is widely shared within the reform movements in Iran , within and outside government , movements by the technocratic and business class , whose approach is more movements . 
Finally , for Iranian hardliners , the possibility of cooperation with the United States is pure fantasy . 
They are convinced that America is merely seeking to undermine the Iranian security and endanger its national interests.
According to the radicals , the United States will seek at least to impose significant changes to Iranian foreign policy . 
At worst, they say, America will actively seek to impose a regime change in Iran.
It would militera strongly against the acquisition of knowledge and nuclear energy militera Iran and could even try to weaken the military militera of Iran in its entirety . 
The Radicals see the American invasion of Iraq as a reflection of America's willingness to contain Iran . 
In return, they believe that Iran must take an aggressive stance in defending its interests, and form strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers and use the Iranian influence in Iraq for preventing the formation of a  pro-American and anti-Iranian government in Baghdad.
Hard line supporters on all sides support this approach . 
The overthrow of Saddam and his regime was more easy to Iraq.
Now the harder is left to do establish peace and security , winning the left against terrorism and convince the Muslim masses that America left not intention to occupy Iraq and siphon its left resources and redesign the Middle East to its image left 
Meanwhile , the opposition against the United States , such as the of suicide bombings or other forms of terrorism , will probably grow . 
Iran is poised to keep its dominant position in the region through its political momentum and its Muslim identity, whose echo resonates throughout the Muslim world.
What happens in Iraq has major implications in Iran and the United States would do well to find a way to recognize that . 
The American threat , or the discussions on another war , feed threat fire of resentment and frustration in Iran , strengthening threat movements of the more radical . 
If the US wants to avoid such effects , it must agree to the influence of its own radical assuming that American interests in Iraq are better protected through cooperation with Iran .

A way out for Iraq
The situation in Iraq has reached a point where everybody supposedly wants the same thing for departure forces to everybody . 
The recent disclosure of a confidential memorandum from the Ministry of Defence of Britain on the withdrawal of troops has stressed that aspiration.
The only question is to find out how to satisfy her.
As long as the Coalition forces remain , violence will only increase .
However, if they go, the escalation of violence will take place anyway, and even faster.
The real question in Iraq is how to organize an army and police that can be trusted to enforce law and order.
There are still many a way to approach this goal.
Despite the courage of many Iraqis who join the ranks of the police or the army , it is not surprising that some of them have incentives are less than pure . 
In northern Iraq , one of old scores and ethnic segregation is introduced in some areas traditionally been mixed , as Irbil . 
In some other regions, Sharia law is imposed.
How Iraq can create body capable of enforcing the law effectiveness and fairness , regardless of ethnicity , religion or gender ? 
The traditional response is to recruit , and instill good values . 
But time is short.
Other ways must be found.
In the absence of a deeply rooted system , Iraq needs associations embedded in civil society , to which the police and the army will be accountable . 
These could take various forms , but most importantly they are truly pervasive at the local , and they have the support of district authorities in the region and country when they report abuse . 
If a local surveillance is put in place , supplemented and recognised nationally , when most members of the military and police forces will no doubt behave appropriately , and otherwise , it will be easier to identify and manage them .
Such measures may be overly optimistic, and yet in Afghanistan, a country like Iraq in many ways, many groups are working together.
The cooperation for Peace and Unity CPAU provides a model of cooperation to operate . 
In Afghanistan , in Iraq , the priority of ordinary people has been to reduce violence .
The CPAU has worked throughout the country over three years to put in place committees of peace in the districts , supported by advice of satellites in the villages . 
This initiative , faces a culture in which violence is so deeply rooted that children , at time , learned the arithmetic accounting counting the dead Soviet soldiers . 
The committees have tried to bring together all the groups in the community, particularly teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, the police, judges and businessmen, in order to devise ways to resolve conflicts without violence.
Even if the committees was not officially a supervisory role to date (that is expected in the future), the fact that the police, army and justice in the places in contact with the rest of the community, allows for a return of information, and contributes to the establishment of trust.
Certain results are remarkable.
In one of the workshops, the local military commander came to spend some hours our of courtesy, and finished by staying all week.
party left apologizing for his violent past and committed party disarm his private army of 2 , 000 men . 
He now makes regular the offices of the committee . 
In Iraq, projects such as the humanitarian links center of Kirkuk are starting to play a role in monitoring by offering to the people of different ethnic groups the opportunity to explain his grievances and to get help to solve its problems.
But too often, even in the case to trial, the judgment is not applied for the victims on the threat.
The US and British forces have already worked to strengthen civil society.
However , we do not hear talk of workshops for emancipation of women or the success organization organizing local elections on a small scale in the country . 
Mobilizing civil society represents an enormous challenge, particularly when, as in Iraq, this must be done quickly and on a grand scale.
The military forces are still needed , but also encouragement for disarmament , which can take the form of prospects for economic opportunities more fruitful than crime and theft . 
Fortunately, such an organisation of civil society is as low-cost as it is important.
The humanitarian association links Center treats all Kirkuk at an annual cost of links , 000 . 
With ten million dollars , we could make about one centres of the same kind , and there would still be currency . 
It is to engage in this direction , to support without support the brave people who raise the challenge to demand accountability of power . 
Having À , the Iraqi people may not have the À desperately needed after years of suffering .

Democracy on the Nile?
The decision surprised the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment allowing holding direct presidential elections and competitive could well be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and in the Arab world.
The West used to a pluralist democracy can have to understand what potentially significant change this decision will bring in a country used to military rule for more than 50 years . 
Under the current system , Egyptian citizens can only show up the day of a referendum every six years to say yes or no to the only name on the presidential elections . 
This explains why an individual such as Mubarak has always received more than 90 of votes , among an indifferent turnout . 
The strong Syrian and Iraqi men have done even better with this system , perhaps because they have demanded that the names and addresses of the voters are placed at the bottom of each ballot . 
Several people support for a long time that democratization in the Middle East will not move forward until Egypt will not get involved in the process.
Egypt cannot really engage on a path to democracy without first amending its constitution , in order to reduce the pharaonic powers operation its president and limit the length of his term . 
Mubarak, after all, already is in his 24th year as president.
Thus, his announcement of competitive presidential elections is a first major step.
The regime can assume it will be able to benefit from the advantage , but the events could prove more difficult to monitor once people start to feel held responsibility . 
genius democratic democracy is out of the bottle . 
In any case , Egypt is not the only in this troubled region to embark on the road to democracy . 
Turkey on one side of the Middle East and Morocco on the other are already engaged in this process.
The real groundswell this time seems to result from proximity close and positive results of recent elections held proximity Iraq , Palestine , and , to a lesser degree proximity Saudi Arabia . 
The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria's occupation of Lebanon following the assassination demonstrations former prime minister Rafiq al Hariri don't seem to demonstrations abating . 
Egyptian opposition groups have also organized , increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in recent weeks . 
The catalyst of their anger has been the arrest and detention of the sick opposition leader, Ayman Nour, in late January.
The vagaries has reinvigorated the national movement Kifaya meaning vagaries , which has demanded an end to the Mubarak vagaries . 
Suddenly, popular wisdom that the Egyptians are passive and are afraid to act didn't seem to hold up. .
An alliance of local forces, regional and international unit against permanent tyranny exerted on the shores of the Nile.
The recent wave of popular pressure seems to have shaken the regime.
Only a month before, muybarak disrupted the demands of constitutional reform in the taxing of "futile".
But, whatever the combination of events that led the turnaround, the initiative about the elections must be welcomed.
This is a necessary first step, although it is not enough to overhaul the stagnant political system in Egypt.
The Egyptians are wary of symbolic reforms to the country in which the Tunisian President Zine El Abidin bin Ali, who occupies office for a long time, has created a caricature of constitutional amendment which appeared to pave the way presidential elections competitive, but which subsequently led to a show of support with a few "opponents ’ handpicked.
In previous Tunisian presidential referendums , Bin Ali would systematically score 99 of the votes ; this , he reached 96 . 
Let's hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform . 
To prove his sincerity , he should order the immediate release of Ayman Nour , and take steps to end the 24 emergency years , which prevents the organization of political campaigns . 
Mubarak must also approve a limit of two consecutive terms of five years for each president.
Just as necessary are measures to win the confidence of citizens, notably open and equal access to the media, which is currently controlled by the state.
I announced that I intended to contest the coming presidential election in order to open the debate on these essential reforms.
But I would happily go to my life as a private citizen when I have the of a free and open election next autumn . 
If they are seriously implemented, these steps will transform the legacy of Mubarak.
With the events in Lebanon , Iraq and Palestine , they could very well start a long overdue Arab spring of time .

Historic elections for Égypte ? 
Egyptians go to the polls on September 7 to Égyptiens a president from among 10 candidates , including Hosni Mubarak Égyptiens in power for 24 years . 
Even few doubt that he will be re elected at the end of the election , many follow the developments with passion .
Some 6,000 national election observers have been trained for the occasion, and hundreds of international observers will come in the country this week.
Although all the trappings of a real electoral competition are put in place, it is striking that several signs of authenticity are missing.
Despite the promises to the , the of the game are far from fair . 
Mubarak has a disproportionate number of advantages name recognition , a virtual monopoly of electronic media controlled by the État , and nothing less than 85 of print media . 
A week before the vote , some opposition candidates have not yet had the vote to launch a single campaign on Egyptian television . 
All members of the presidential election commission are appointed by Mubarak , and the new electoral rules have eliminated all independent competitors . 
Since 2000, a Supreme Court decision requires 8,000 Egyptians judges to supervise the elections and certify the results.
It is a big step towards fairer elections, because the professional judges have remained relatively independent during the last half-century of grip on the executive power.
The Mubarak regime has had to use a variety of subterfuge to neutralise the judges' union . 
One of them was to stretch the definition of court to include thousands of persons who have law degrees without experience on the bench but who are otherwise loyal to the government . This leaves little room for true judges , because if they protest by boycotting their supervisory duties , the task will fall once more to the police of the infamous Ministry of the Interior . 
And , in the past , the judges' union fulfilled its task with predictable results .
During the parliamentary elections in 2000 , while the ruling party of Mubarak only received approximately 38 of votes in areas controlled by the real judges , the results managed to culminate in 86 when the almost judges were responsible for observation . 
This year promises to be very different.
In the spring, judges have held a house for nationwide and found that, unless the government gives them a complete independence and exclusive surveillance of the process of elections, they do not being the presidential poll (or parliamentary) to come.
September 2, they gave their final demand: the regime must allow groups to observe the elections, stop to change the definition of judges in a legitimate election, and accept that no ballot leaves the presence of a legitimate judge  without its content to be counted, certified and postponed.
For now , it seems that the situation is hopeless , because the head of the presidential election commission announced publicly on Egyptian television that he refused any comment by the citizens on the election elections . 
Among other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate on the issue should we boycott the election or vote ? 
Many opposition parties have called on their members to abstain in protest against repressive rules that strongly favor Mubarak . 
Moreover , the Muslim Brotherhood , regarded as the only opposition group with any weight in Égypte , pushing their supporters to vote according to their conscience but not to support any of oppressive and corrupt . 
This is an unspoken but clear repudiation of Mubarak , the only head of État for 24 years . 
Some 34 civil society organisations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians for Égyptiens of the elections despite the governement's repeated government action 
These groups argue that if the regime has no intention of rigging the elections , then the presence of national and international observers should not pose any problems .
The regime's response is that any external oversight is interference in Egyptian sovereignty and that national observers would be an affront to the integrity of the judges.
The last argument was quickly dropped when the of judges favour in of civil society observers . 
As the Mubarak regime is frightened of the voice of internal and external that the challenge to hold free and fair elections, or that it is simply unable to remove the cheat within the party as it became associated with its operation, the current signs do not bode well on the ballot next Wednesday.
Meanwhile , for the first time the Egyptians Égyptiens experience a challenge to the tyranny , and take Égyptiens of a whole new area of freedom .

The European envy of  the dollar
Currency plays a vital role not only in commercial transactions , but also in diplomatic and political wrangling . 
When that happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.
The politicisation of money during the Depression between WWI and interwar politicisation to be economically devastating . 
But violent wars have currencies more recently . 
During the 1960s, the international monetary order turned into a political tug-of-war.
Every player had significantly different theories and explanations about the situation.
Europeans , especially the French , complained that General Charles de Gaulle once called the U . S . dollar an exorbitant privilege . 
The general and its monetary guru Jacques Rueff, argued that the United States used the dollar's status as a reserve currency most of the fixed exchange rate regime Woods to manage the deficits and pay their military adventurism abroad (at that time in Vietnam).
France responded by calling for monetary reform that would end the special role of the dollar , and tried to resuscitate the widely discredited gold . 
The Europeans began a long discussion on the benefits of the monetary union, which would allow them to compete with the dollar.
But from the American of view , the international role of the dollar was a trap . 
Other countries could change their exchange rates and could maintain greater competition at the exports' level.
The American government is powerless against an undervalued yen , fueling the belief that the rest of the world is using the dollar to undermine the manufacture . 
The Nixon administration concluded that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in a world currency a monetary expansion so spectacular that other countries would be forced to adjust their exchange rates . 
These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly present again.
The world has more than one fixed exchange rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency, a kind of floating Bretton Woods.
For Americans, the role of reserve of the dollar is a potential threat, while for those not Americans, rather, it is another example of search néo-impériale US hegemony.
During this decade, China has taken Japan's place of the 1960s, preventing its exchange rate to climb to push the growth of exports.
This has made it the target of American complaints about unfair competition and about efforts to impose an adjustment of exchange rates likely to dissuade Americans from buying Chinese toys, equipment and clothing.
American manufacturers have estimated that the bra manufactured in China threaten the American way of life bra 
Meanwhile, Europeans (and especially the French) complains about the huge US deficits and the argument of Charles de Gaulle stating that the rest of the world pays for the wars of America is back in fashion.
Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a larger proportion of their reserves in euros, an echo of the failed attempt of the general to capitulate America by selling dollars against gold.
The 1960s ended with the collapse of the system and major financial turmoil , including an wave inflation prices . 
Everyone was affected , and America's role on the world has been shaken . 
A similar collapse at the moment should have a slightly different . 
The current floating rate system is more stable and the adjustment costs are differently distributed.
The majority of Americans do not suffer from the sharp drop of the dollar , as foreign dealers must make price adjustments for the American market .
The Asian economies are strongly growing and their central banks are relying on the United States.
They should continue this policy in not to see their export industries suffer sudden failure on the American market capital . 
The United States will have more time to address the current deficit , which will prove unsustainable in the long term . 
The world's economically dynamic regions North America and Asia are bound by a pact that will ensure the continued centrality of the American dollar .
The Americans will continue to accumulate debts because Asians are encouraging it.
The repeal of the pact would be contrary to the interests of both parties.
It is not of American unilateralism because the pact requires collaboration with Asia . 
But for Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it resembles a monetary and economic unilateralism.
Meanwhile, the supremacy of the euro over the dollar negatively affected European industrial exporters.
Europe is still not in a to relieve relief . 
Europe will in represent the biggest victim of the new currencies . 
The pronostiquées forecasted in the 1960s restoration of the gold standard or pronostiquées of a single European currency do not seem very pronostiquées anymore . 
A single currency has failed to provide protection.
The old version of the European reaction (what psychologists call "the envy of the dollar") will become only more vivid.
The European Central Bank will be invited to expand the monetary base , as imitation imitating the dollar was the answer to all the manufacturers , structural and demographic problems invading Europe . 
But we should remember that Europe's problems do not arise from the manipulation of currencies.
The protests against the new version of the monetary exorbitant privilege of America should be seen for what they are: a way to compensate for a real European impotence.
The envy of the dollar is therefore notclose to disappearing and will grow, the value of the international dollar disappearing without clearly harmful effects on people who can and use it.

An outbreak of policy . 
The Americans , like the citizens of all the countries of the world , came to accept the fact that policy plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public representatives . 
Few of us are surprised some may be disappointed when a federal judge or a senior diplomat is appointed because he has passed a crucial test of loyalty to an important principle in the eyes of the party of president or prime minister .
But science, in the opinion of all, occupies a special place; and on this point, the United States is starting to serve as a cautionary example for the rest of the world.
Scientific scientists must be based on objective criteria for training , scientists and performance . 
Obviously, it is legitimate to interrogate a future secretary of the Health and Human Services (SSH) about his views on abortion.
But it is totally wrong to submit the shortlisted candidates to sit in the scientific advisory committees in tests of political loyalty.
Similarly, belonging to the bodies at the scientific proposals, a process to scientific progress, will undoubtedly be shedding all the barriers that are unrelated to the professional qualifications.
Unfortunately, scientists in the United States will more and more often face these barriers.
During last autumn, the Science journal published several reports on the issue.
One of these reports to the massive replacement of members of the advisory reports of the National Center for Environmental Health , which reports part of the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reports , without prior consultation with the director of the reports . 
Similar cases have also been observed in the Advisory Committee on lead Poisoning and Prevention of CCC , the National Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing . 
The current outbreak of ideology, in which the advisory committees are dissolved then retrained with new members, and where the candidates are subjected to tests of loyalty, seems to be overtaken by some observers.
Representatives of the SSH referred to as a "fairly common practice".
This is not a common practice in America, or at least not until today.
In any cases , the fact that the Bush cases makes candidates for key posts pass tests in order to cases their compatibility with its values is not really disturbing cases 
The development of the more alarming is the level of importance of ideological investigations, which can then come in areas previously immune to this kind of manipulation.
Indeed , the most revealing in this growing political epidemic may have affected the reworking of belonging to the section of study of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health , which assesses the subsidies to the study of injuries occurred in the workplace . 
The advisory committees could have been vulnerable to an overhaul of this type in the past . 
After all, they have recommended the policies that politicians will take or not into account.
But (What about) the study sections ?
In October of 2002, Science published an editorial by David Michaels and several of his colleagues.
Several of them were distinguished former officials who participated in some of the relevant committees, and they have brought a valuable point of view on the issue based on their personal experience.
Their article was a matter by itself, but the consequences that it had were even more interesting.
It triggered a flock of letters in which scientists wrote of similar experiences flock 
A candidate for the Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee of the National Institutes of Health reported that a member of the White House carried out an inquiry on it . 
After been invited to give her views on the various policies of the Bush administration , one had link with the committee's work , she had to say whether she supported the president's policy on embryonic stem cells . 
Another person who appeared, a distinguished professor in psychiatry and psychology, reported having received a call from the White House concerning his appointment to the National Council on Drug Abuse.
His investigation has told him that he had to investigate him to determine if his views could embarrass investigation president . 
According to Professor , a series of questions followed representative the White House representative holding a rating . 
Example: "You have two to three; the president is opposed to sharing needles (for drug users intraveineuses) for moral reasons, whatever the result."
Then the conversation took an even more alarming turn.
The representative asked the candidate if he had voted for representative and , having received a negative response , he representative Why didn't you support the President ? 
This is akin to dictatorship , not democracy . 
The aim of scientific advisory committees is to provide impartial aim and reflect on political process . 
There is nothing to gain, and much to lose, when a desired political result is put forward.
This is why the determination as to which research projects should be supported has always been a question to be examined objectively by , and not by politicians . 
In fact , the law that applies here the law on federal advisory committees , the Federal Advisory Committee Act specifically requires that committees be impartial not inappropriately influenced by the authority of appointed powers .
The U . S . Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson and the White House should set an example for the of the world . 
They can do it very easily: staying within the law.

Murder in Moscow
It is time to put an end to the myth that the "dictatorship of law" of Vladimir Putin has made post-communist Russia as little saying  more law-abiding.
The killing of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the journalists among the best and most courageous in Russia, a woman who dared to put out the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is the ultimate proof that President Putin leads a banal dictatorship  showing the ordinary contempt for the law.
It is time for the rest of the world to recognise it, particularly for Europe.
The German Foreign Office is preparing a policy on relations between Russia and Germany, which should ratify the indifference to the lack of respect for law shown by Putin as national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes reconciliation when it encourages Putin to continue on this path in reconciliation international arena , as evidenced by his ongoing campaign reconciliation strangle Georgia's . 
The murder of Politkovskaya caused an eerie sense of déjà vu: just as in the glory days of the KGB, people simply disappear in Putin's Russia.
The murder of Politkovskaya was the third apparently political policy in three week . 
Enver ziganshin, engineer in chief of BP Russia, was killed by gunshot in Irkutsk on the 30th of September.
Andrei Kozlov, deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was murdered on the 14th September.
The fact that the Russian General Prosecutor , Yuri Tchaïka , took over the investigation of the murder of hand , as he did for Kozlov's , is not a source of hope , as would be the case in a real democracy if such a senior official was involved in an investigation . 
In fact, the involvement of the highest levels of government in Russia is virtually an assurance that the murderer will never be found.
The murder of Politkovskaya was sign particularly grim , fact that she was sign powerful criticism of Russia's President . 
In his articles for a few newspapers still independent from Moscow, novaïa by Gazeta, and in his books, "Putin's Russia: life in a Democratic leadership" and "a dirty war: a Russian journalist in Chechnya" Politkovskaya commenting on the abolition of the freedoms that sign the presidency of Vladimir Putin.
As the fate of the exiled former businessmen Boris Berezovski and Vladimir Gusinki and the jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrates , the of Putin's enemies can take three forms exile , prison or grave . 
I am not accusing Putin's government for ordering the murder of Politkovskaya.
After all, as an investigative journalist in the campaign, it was rabid lots of other people in addition to Putin, including the current prime minister of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov is not least, she accused of conducting a policy of kidnapping against ransoms.
But even if Vladimir Putin's had nothing to do with Politkovskaya's by a ball in an of lift building in Moscow , his contempt for the law created the climate in which the murder was perpetrated . 
Like the murder of Thomas Beckett in À image many centuries ago , the crime was À with image strong conviction that the King would be À . 
Given what Politkovskaya represented - the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies - the government should have ensured that nothing would happen to him.
Putin's Russia has already lost 12 prominent journalists, murdered during the last six years.
None of these crimes has been uncovered, which would not be the case if Putin's "dictatorship of law" was something other than a mere public relations strategy.
The six years that have elapsed since the arrival of Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin have been marked by deeply contradictory signals.
On the one hand , the world sees a young , educated leader pledging to modernize Russia , particularly to put law enforcement and judicial practices in line with international standards .
Of the other side , the president is content to watch without saying side , while his former colleagues of the Russian security side of the FSB the former KGB does not protect side being assassinated , and even launch a number of cases side espionage notorious against journalists , scientists and environmental activists side 
Among these neo spies are the journalist Gregori Pasko , an expert on arms control , Igor Soutiagine , the diplomat Valentine Moiseïev , the Valentin Danilov and many others . 
The supposedly civilising influence that means being a partner, presiding over a G8 summit in St. Petersburg, for example, seems to count for nothing in the cabal of Putin's Kremlin.
Once again , contact with Western values gave birth to another Potemkin village ; Russia will present a facade of laws and democratic rules , behind the papier mâché scene are the same stubborn and arbitrary people making the law .
Globally, the danger is that the lawlessness shown by Putin exports.
Near the Russian borders , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root . 
Think of how Putin's to rig the elections in Ukraine , and allegations cesses and withdrawn against the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko . 
Consider the breakaway regions that act as mavericks in Moldova and Georgia, which exist only because they have the support of the Kremlin.
Watch how the Kremlin is trying to blackmail its neighbours by threatening their energy supplies . 
All the police know that when we ignore the behaviour of criminals, they only become more adventurous.
It is time that the world recognizes Vladimir Putin for what he is a man who takes Russia back to the country of shadows . 
The world must now consider this old saying , tacet consentere videtur who says mention agrees , and wonder if it is really wise to peace to the construction by Putin of a energy superpower when the law does not count .

A pipeline to strengthen the Russian empire 
Gerhard Schröder , Germany's Chancellor less than a month ago , has agreed to become president the company responsible construction building a pipeline linking Russia to Germany across the Baltic Sea and Western Europe . 
In many countries , Schroeder would be easily offence of conflict of interest . 
His apparent ethical failure is magnified by the fact that at the same failure , Russia threatens to halt gas supplies to failure if it does not give in to the tariff failure giant Gazprom , property giant État owned gas failure . 
The strategic goal of Russia is obvious . Currently , Not distributing any gas to Ukraine also means that much of Europe will not be supplied , most of the major pipelines cross Ukraine .
Bypassing Ukraine , Poland and , of course , États Baltic states , the new pipeline will increase the influence of the Kremlin which seeks new footholds in the region . 
President Vladimir Putin and his government of former KGB clones will not have to worry reactions Western Europe's when deciding how hard to pressure his post neighbours Russian . 
Should Europe really give Putin such an imperialist imperialist ? 
Worse still , Russia must use this weapon to surrender the EU to its power ? 
That a former German chancellor would take up the leadership of the company that will give Russia the way leadership manipulate the European economy shows the dangerous complacency of leadership in the of Putin's neo imperialistic ambitions . 
Of course, the Russian media are aware of Europe's growing dependence on reports from Russia's energy resources.
They are going up to be délecter . The Russian newspaper columnists have written when we délecter built and expanded our energy trade with Europe , délecter will have to remain silent on the issue of human rights délecter 
Putin expresses this position in a more indirect by committing to pursue what he calls a policy of independence . 
Thus, does he wants to simply say that Russia must be "independent" from the concerns of Western democracies on ethics and human rights.
It may be that some European leaders truly believe that maintaining the prosperity of the EU justifies its on the of human rights and other sensitive issues that vex the Kremlin . 
Of briefly we briefly have to speak on the issues trade , as the briefly of Yukos . If the Kremlin had to pay briefly values and our critical to her as Chechnya bloodstained briefly seems that Europeans would prefer to hide that to briefly a potential increase in energy prices , or even briefly blockade , such as Ukraine is currently facing . 
While Putin reorganize its court, submitting the Duma to its will, hopes to see Russia become more "European" should be abandoned.
Russia that Putin is building has gradually transformed. It has changed from its hopes of post-Soviet freedom to become a bulwark oil and gas for the new elite of the former KGB.
Indeed , Matthias Warnig , the director of the pipeline consortium led by Schröder , is a longstanding friend of Putin . 
Earlier this year , the Wall Street Journal revealed that Warnig , the director of the Dresdner Bank in Russia , is a former Stasi officer , East Germany's former secret police , and that he met Putin at the end of the 1980s the Russian president was a KGB spy in the GDR .
The that the Russians accept a government formed by former KGB men , for which lack of compassion and refusal of dissent are the rule , reflects their depletion from the tumult of the last twenty years . 
Now , the Kremlin believes that what is good for ordinary Russians is also good for the citizens of independent nations . No mercy will be granted to small and weak countries once Russia will have the means to intimidate , isolate and threaten them with energy sanctions .
As a former head of État the newly independent Lithuania , I was often confronted État such threats . 
The European Union has signed several agreements with Russia, including a "common area" of freedom and justice.
The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism.
Its control of Eastern Europe has always been exercised on the basis of treaty of friendship , and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were brotherly missions . 
But look how Putin area common barbaric treatment of Chechens , the imprisonment area businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky , the harassment of foreign NGOs and area of Yuliya Tymoshenko , one of the égéries the area Revolution , by Russian military judges on burden invented . 
If the Europeans believe sincerely in their common area of human rights and freedoms, they must acknowledge that these values are not shared by the henchmen calculating Putin.
It is the same as considering Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.
Is it truly conceivable that the homeland of the red terror , of countless unpunished crimes in homeland Soviet era and hands still sales with the blood homeland Lithuanians and Caucasians , can really help to combat the homeland threat brandished by Iran and North Korea ? 
It seems more likely that the cold of the Kremlin will be content to exploit every crisis to increase cold power of destruction and their influence . 
For decades, the region of Europe where I come from was left to the mercy of evil.
That's why I cannot remain silent Europe stumbles blindly into deference .
We , the new democracies of Eastern Europe , have learned from our history that behind every act of Russian diplomacy lurks imperial . 
Western Europeans , who have forgotten this history , should heed the warnings . 
The dependence to Russia -- even if it takes the face of so-called "charismatic" Gerhard Schröder -- can only lead us into the wall.

bullet against papers 
When the Iraq war began in 2003 , the Bush administration was nursing ambitious projects in the image of post 1945 Germany and Japan , a long and peaceful occupation was envisioned , during which the increase in oil production would ensure a growing prosperity the democratic structures were built up piece by piece .
The foundation should be a liberal constitution , even post modern , with the insurance premium that 25 of parliamentary seats should be assigned to women . 
The current Iraq knows no peace or prosperity.
The constitution to be voted on October includes the 25 rule , but is not nothing at liberal . 
The key article 2 stipulates that no law can contradict the undisputed laws of Islam , which violates the basic principles of parliamentary sovereignty , and prevents legislation consistent with international standards . 
For example , the age of sexual consent for girls cannot be raised over nine years because Muhammad himself had a wife of nine years . 
It follows that of the girls of nine years ago are also adults in the criminal law, and below average for the death penalty, for example, conversion to another religion.
The Shiites can use this clause to put their ayatollahs above the elected parliament , as in Iran , because they alone have the authority to determine the laws of Islam .
Foreigners and the few Iraqi are especially concerned about this Islamic clause , but opposition to the constitution , widespread among Sunnis , is directed elsewhere the exclusion of the Saddamist Baath party from and government , and the Federalist provisions that grant autonomy to Iraq's 18 provinces and allow them to join with regional governments . 
The law of exclusion is a personal problem for the Sunni elite, which includes thousands of businessmen, liberals, even artists who, with a few exceptions, were all members of the Ba'ath.
In theory, the constitutional ban could not be retroactive.
But in practice , administrative laws are now being implemented in order to exclude the so called high members of the Baath from any form of government employment , which affects thousands of people . 
Sunnis would without doubt accept federalist if they didn't apply to the Kurds . 
They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism , but the secession of the three predominantly Kurdish provinces of Dahuk , Arbil and as Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan , with its own Ministry of Finance , army the Pesh Merga , and oil production around Kirkuk , the second largest reserves in Iraq .
The Sunnis reject this same federalism for Shiites because they see them as fellow Arabs, who have always agreed the law Sunni in the past and who will once again, unless they have their own government.
This is what would allow the new constitution, because the southern provinces - which own the main Iraqi oil supplies in majority Shi'ites could form their own regional government.
In the usual style of the middle east , the Sunni leadership disappointed and angry with the constitution now threaten to use violence . 
But federalism is not the only reason why proponents of Sunni leadership and islamists deadly attacks . 
Their opposition is more basic: they do not accept the principle of democratic government by the majority.
, they are trying to restore the rule of the Sunni minority .
For the islamists , all Shias deserve death anyway , as apostates . 
A Shiite leader, Moqtada al-Sadr, has also vehemently opposed federalism.
His supporters , mostly illiterate , are the poorest and most violent Shiites from Baghdad's slums and beyond , including the Mahdi militia that fought American troops in 2004 , even when the Americans were protecting the Shiites from Sunni attacks . 
As a young priest derived its authority to his father, Ayatollah died a populist, al-Sadr faces opposition from the ayatollahs Iraqis living, which hold their ignorance and its violence.
Sadr cannot possibly compete with them in terms of religious authority ; he chose to pose an Arab nationalist party against them , often recalling that the highest Shiite cleric , Ayatollah Sistani , is not Arab but Persian . 
Similarly, he reminds his supporters that the El Hakim, who run the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri) and their militia "Badr" were involved in exile in Iran, which many fought from the Iranian side during the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war, until the Americans' bring them back. "
Sadr opposes federalism a Shiite regional government would submit to his enemies , Sistani the SCIRI , , he says , fall under the aegis of Iran .
To underscore his message , Sadr sent his men to fight the Badr militia , with success in Baghdad , where Mahdi are many , but not in Najaf , where Sadr is hated after the destruction he caused last year until that his men were massacred by the Americans . 
It was difficult enough to confront gangster À . À present a simple political simple suggests gangster it will probably be the main character to decide gangster outcome of the vote to the constitution in October . 
To reject the constitution and force new elections for order constitutional assembly , opponents need a two thirds order in at least three provinces . 
The Sunnis are not likely to prevail except in two provinces , but if Sadr his followers from the slums of Baghdad to vote no with the local Sunnis , that would undoubtedly cause the capital to fall into the hands of opponents of the constitution and ensure its defeat . 
Like every political thug , Sadr is of course for . 
Last year he was wanted for murder.
Today he seeks a recognition as man État , he wants money , and man at État implicitly , the humiliation of Sistani and man . 
He may well receive proposals, and the negotiations may have even begun.
But some Shiites whom he attacks with words and bullets have thousands of gunmen at their disposal , he does not deserve such retribution .

The end of the secret.
Transparency is not always easy in the new democracies in Eastern Europe. This is what the Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány discovered when a recording in which he confessed the lies of his government triggered riots.
Like Hungary, post-communist Romania has tried to encourage openness and honesty in a society that used to be among the most closed in the world.
But the persistence of a culture of secrecy exploded in corruption and abuses of power.
We see, however, a real shift toward greater transparency, a shift recognized by the European Union which gave the go-ahead to Romania for membership in early 2007.
In addition to the implementation of what the EU calls today functioning market economy , the essential reforms in the political and legal , that I have in burden , will increase the transparency and control of the funding of political parties to the reorganisation of the judicial system . 
The judicial reforms are contributing to root out corruption.
Ministers and former ministers , politicians , judges , lawyers and members of the police politicians customs judges other public bodies , and also the heads politicians private judges , have been charged . 
Moreover, new forms have been developed for the declaration of assets and financial interests by people in official functions in government, parliament, in public and local administration and in the judicial system.
The new arrangements of statement are the most detailed in Europe and arrangements above statement , they are made public . 
Romania's progress is confirmed by a report published this month, according to which the people of Eastern Europe now have access to government information as well as those of the long-established democracies.
The Transparency and Silence report from the Open Society Justice Initiative (available on www.justiceinitiative.org) even says that the new democracies sometimes do better than the old: some Romanian government bodies respond better to requests for information than their French or Spanish counterparts.
More precisely, 60% of the demands were met in Romania, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.
Among the other good person , you can quote Peru and Mexico , person countries that have passed legislation on freedom of information person 2002 , shortly after Romania . 
it is not always easy to gain access to sensitive However in transitional democracies .
I have worked as a lawyer for the defence of human rights in the Helsinki Romanian , and we often had to go to courts to demand , according to the Romanian law in 2001 for freedom of information . 
For example , when we officially gained access to data telephone authorized by the Attorney General , he simply ignored the decision . 
We attacked him in civil , and the judge has set a fine for each day of delay in the flow of information . 
It is only when the media became interested in the case that the data the number of authorized wiretaps during the previous 10 years , the targeted people and the duration of operations have been made public . 
Romania has finally started to turn its back to a past marked by the omnipresence of the Securitate.
I am now part of the government, and I realise that it is not always easy to share some information with the public.
But sometimes painful reforms are needed.
We would not have completed the economic and political reforms that will enable us to enter the EU without submitting our policies to the examination of the public and without accepting the greater participation of citizens in the decision making process that inevitably accompanies such an opening . 
In fact , access to information has become a sine qua non for democracy worldwide . 
When the United States adopted the Freedom of Information Act in 1966 , they were the only , with Sweden and Finland . 
Today, 65 countries are equipped with such legislation.
In Romania, those who fought for the adoption of a law on the freedom of information are taking full advantage of it.
According to the Justice Initiative's study, the people who come to the Romanian government receive without much difficulty information that it would have been unthinkable to communicate a few years ago.
Thus, the Romanian Ministry of Defence leaked the number of soldiers who died in 2003, and the circumstances (including 13 suicide, two deaths by gunshot, and two died in battle in Afghanistan).
Another example, the court of Bucharest has received a request concerning the number of judges who have been the subject of a disciplinary procedure since the beginning of 2000, and the motives of possible sanctions.
The court has sent this request to the Supreme Council of the judiciary, who has given a complete answer: four pages listing all the judges punished, the grounds and the measures taken.
This process is at the same the result and the engine of the pursuit of reforms . 
Leaders have not always been very comfortable with opening , and the battle continues with to the most sensitive documents . 
But in the former Communist countries, the benefits of transparency are undeniable.
Yet the experience of Romania shows that official secrecy is always a threat, no country is immune, and that only constant vigilance can prevent it from undermining the foundations of democracy.

Save the trees of life
Nobody can finish his day without having used a a sideshow from the forest . 
In a far more important than we normally believes , the paper on which we writte , the water flowing from the taps , the drugs that we are taking , timber from what our homes and furniture are made of come from the forest . 
The forests provide us the fresh air we breathe and are home to endangered species.
They also provide us places recreational entertainment , which become increasingly important complexity entertainment complex world . 
About 1 . 5 billion people living in poor rural areas depend directly on forests for their basic needs for food and . 
However, deforestation continues.
Every year , we lose 14 . 6 million hectares of forest , an area almost as much hectares four times the of Switzerland . 
The irresponsible management of forests, exacerbated by regulations and government bonds too weak, and the markets that reward illegal logging all conspire to deprive the world of its most valuable forests and the greatest threat.
When the forests begin to disappear, a range of environmental, social and economic problems generally follow, that affect us all in one way or another.
The island of Sumatra in Indonesia is a good example.
Pulp and pasta companies papers an endemic and unlawful destruction of the forests pasta are papers to the greatest diversity of crops in pasta world papers 
It is highly likely that plants still unknown will disappear in the process just like the endangered species such as the Rhino , the Sumatran Elephant , and the Orangutan . 
When forest will have disappeared , entire communities will places themselves life a proper means decent to forest lives 
, the distortion that trade in illegal products and cheap products imposes on world markets causes difficulties for responsible citizens .
Developing countries lose $15 billion of tax revenues every year because of illegal logging.
To complicate , the demand for wood for reconstruction following the tsunami last year has intensified application already unsustainable demand for wood from Sumatran forests . 
The dam in the Amazon and the Congo are subject to dam threats . 
A recent study of the United Nations, the Évaluation ecosystems of the Millennium (em), shows that the forests and other important areas have a serious decline because of their mismanagement and will continue to disappear if serious protection measures are not put in place.
The information published by the Brazilian government shows that deforestation of forest in the Amazon , from the fact conversions , rose to 2 . 6 million acres last year , which brings the total area of deforestation in the Amazon to 17 . 
But the battle against deforestation is not yet lost . 
Various organisations , groups and businesses worried about the state of global forests are working together to reverse the phenomenon of deforestation and improve the management of forests . 
So, for example, the World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank helped the Brazilian government to launch an initiative intended to establish new areas of forest protection over 17 million hectares in the form of national parks.
The cooperation between the World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank prompted also other partners to establish a trust fund in to manage these protected areas for perpetuity . 
Similarly, a meeting at the summit of leaders of countries in the Congo Basin has allowed cross-border cooperation for the preservation of forests and their proper management.
All this was led by the the release of 53 million from the State Department of État United States to promote the conservation of forests in Congo . 
the leaders first met in 1999 , 3 . 5 million acres of protected areas have been newly organised in the Congo basin .
However , given the consequences of the Asian tsunami last December , the weight of evidence provided by the EM , and statistics on deforestation of critical regions suggest we must continue our efforts .
The World Bank and WWF have recently pledged to work toward a 10 reduction in the rate of global deforestation by 2010 and to work with institutions in the public and private sectors to promote ambitious in the conservation of forests . 
Studies show that if the WWF Global forests are shared between different uses, including the protection of certain areas, business management responsible and the restoration of forest landscapes, we can sustain the global forest products while maintaining the environmental and social values are essential to our immediate future.
Business leaders , governments , society organisations should all play their role in achieving that society .

Are the Saudis fanatics?
The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question the survival prospects of the ruling House of Saud and questioning whether or not the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive.
For some reason , it seems that the Saudi society has produced a course of violent bigotry that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy . 
The fact that 15 of the 19 who took part in the attacks of September 11 , 2001 against the United States were Saudis crystallized a long held of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance . 
In some respects , this perception is right , but it cannot be applied wholesale to the Saudi population . 
On the Instead , it would be a serious mistake to assume that Islamic fanaticism completely defines Saudi attitudes toward religion .
Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team to carry out a large-scale study of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran and Jordan.
Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced of Saudi attitudes . 
By comparison with the respondents in other countries in the Middle East , the respondents were the less religious in general , and respondents attitudes towards democracy and arranged marriages also indicate an respondents moderate feeling . 
It is certain that in the four countries , religiosity is widespread , more than 90 of respondents saying religiosity they believe in God , in a life after religiosity , and in heaven and hell . 
But the Saudis seem less religious than their fellow Muslims . 
Sixty two percent of Saudis described themselves individuals religious , compared with 82 of Iranians , 85 individuals Jordanians and 98 of Egyptians . 
The Americans also appear to be more religious than the Saudis, with 81%.
This variation can partly be explained by cross borders differences on the meaning of religiosity . 
For example, Americans can define religiosity differently from people in the Middle East countries, with perhaps a less pronounced attachment to the religious beliefs in Islamic countries.
This may also account in for differences among Muslim countries . 
But the gap , between the Saudis on one and the Iranians , Jordanians and Egyptians on the other terms self autodéfinie religiosity , is so great that it challenges the prevailing perception of Saudi Arabia as highly conservative and religious . 
Indeed, the actions are more telling than the words: Only 28% of the Saudis have said they relations in religious services weekly, against 27% of Iranians, 44 percent of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians and 45% of Americans.
These findings, although contrary to popular perceptions of the Saudi culture, are less surprising than they appear.
Religion sociologists have argued for some time that in an monolithic religious environment , when the religious institutions are closely linked to the state , the religiosity of the population declines .
It is sensible to believe that when the authorities of the State apply strict behavioural codes , people tend to rebel and distance themselves from officially endorsed religious institutions . 
It is hardly surprising that the Egyptians and Jordanians , who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety , are more religious than the Iranians or the Saudis , who must deal with the local vertue police supported by the state .
Even on the issue of marriage , many Saudis opinions surprisingly liberal . 
Respondents were split almost evenly on the issue of arranged marriages, with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent, versus 48% who saw love as the basis of marriage.
Given the gender segregation and paternal dominance firmly rooted , this seems to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has always traditionally been a ruling . 
Finally , the Saudis are fierce supporters of democracy , which contradicts spread widespread image of Saudi conservatism . 
Of all Saudis polled , 58 saw democracy as the best form of government , 23 were in disagreement and 18 had no . 
The overwhelming support for democracy in a country without a secular and nationalist history seems to counterintuitive.
In fact, support for democracy corresponds to many other liberal attitudes that we have noticed in Saudi Arabia.
Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious , more secular , more tolerant of others , more critical of public sector actions , and more concerned with the Western cultural invasion . 
Beyond of the study data, history has shown that liberal ideas become more prevalent when a despotic monarch governs with the support of a religious institution.
A strong movement of liberalism appeared at the end of the ninth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
At the same time , a secular anti clerical movement in the behalf of politics has made its appearance in Iran in response to the alliance between the absolutist Quajar quajar and the religious institution . 
In light of the similarities between past history and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we should not dismiss the possibility of reform.
The study also suggests that the Saudis could very well require a more transparent and a less interventionist religion .

The European museum
At the end of the 19th century , Asia represented for Europeans a source of artistic art or the target of imperial ambitions . 
Conversely, Europe was a symbol of modernity - for the Japanese Meiji -- or decadence -- for the Chinese.
A century later , thanks to the Japanese economic miracle , the Europeans saw at least a small part of Asia as a centre of technological and rapid industrial , progress . 
Today , at the dawn of the 21st century , the mutual perceptions of Europe and Asia are changing dramatically , with the Asian economies booming and a European Union in the of an identity crisis . 
Some Asian personalities, such as former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, warning Europeans: If they continue on this track, their continent will soon have no interest for tourism and high-end real estate.
An influential Chinese businessman, who shares his time between Hong Kong and London, was even more precise.
He said a few weeks ago , during a private gathering in Paris political leaders and big business leaders You are becoming the third world countries . You are wasting your time with the constitution , the welfare state , the funding crisis of pensions , and you systematically give the wrong answers to the questions you are asking . 
The idea that Europeans are from Asia in general and China in particular is more complex . It ranges from clear on competitor one hand , and outright on the other . 
In May 1968 , some French students out in the streets to invent a new world dreamed of Mao's China , even the however was plunged into a senseless and brutal cultural revolution .
This absurd illusion is the result of both the ignorance of the Maoist regime's crimes , the apathy felt in a prosperous society at near full employment .
Today, their heirs  criticise openly the asian capitalist model.
China , once the anti capitalist of the utopian revolutionary , has become the ultra liberal enemy feared by revolutionary new generation of utopian reactionaries who defend the status revolutionary in Europe . 
The students who have demonstrated recently in the streets of Paris do not want to emulate the Chinese and Indians ; they refuse the logic of globalisation and the abandonment of hard achievements social . 
The of Europe's economic elites is very different . 
They have understood that their nostalgia tainted postcolonial ideas nostalgia according to which China and India are large nostalgia markets and huge reservoirs of cheap labor , are nostalgia . 
These countries have become real competitors worthy of respect, even admiration.
The quality, cost and delivery times - in the automotive industry, for example - are now reaching the European level.
Europe still has an advantage in the scientific disciplines , as in the pharmaceutical industry , but new businesses , highly competitive , especially in India , are increasingly recruiting graduates from MIT Harvard , thanks to ever lower labor costs remain competitive globally .
Unfortunately , if the European leaders have become aware of the Asian challenge , they have failed to translate that into a lesson of realism , in a context of globalisation , or in a call to arms in the social and economic . 
In fact , European politicians , with rare exceptions such as Tony Blair , have been too slow to adapt to lightning fulgurantes changes within Asia . 
Without long-term strategy, and obsessed with short-term interests, the European politicians - unlike the business leaders - have not won the respect of their Asian counterparts.
It remains that, on a continent that has not managed to bury the past and to do away with the spectre of nationalism, the EU is also a model of reconciliation, peace and prosperity.
But can this image survive a further decline?
For Asians, the European model could become a political version of Venice: a place that you visit with the nostalgia of former greatness, an admirable Museum.

Red and Blue
The appointment of Condoleezza Rice in the post of American secretary of État as replacement of Colin Powell shows that the recent presidential elections have still powerful . 
It is important that Americans, but also the rest of the world, understand what these elections reveal to us of America.
The presidential election this year shows that American démocracie is healthy , and that some things could démocracie better . 
Unlike the election of 2000, when President Bush had not received the support of the popular vote and barely won the vote of the electoral college, Mr Bush has won 3.5 million votes this time.
While some Democrats remain bitter , the legitimacy of victory . Bush's win cannot be questioned . 
America is deeply divided between États red , Republicans , and blue blue , Democrats États 
If 100 000 votes had stumbled into the red State État Ohio , John Kerry would have become president despite a État vote minority . 
The electoral college was incorporated in the US Constitution to protect small États in the federal system and that means today that the election campaign will focus largely on a dozen states at most , battlefield where public opinion is closely divided . 
Basically , there is something incredible election presidential without popular majority . 
So it is time to discuss amending the constitution to abolish the electoral college.
Some observers are complaining about the rhetoric and negative advertisements to sow discord that have characterized this campaign.
This must be assessed in a historical perspective.
At the time of the founding fathers , newspapers were easily party and George Wahsington was dismayed by the severity of the political policy . 
For most of its early history , without mentioning the civil war and the period of reconstruction , the country was just also strictly divided as it is today , and the bitter rhetoric of the country folk has always reflected this close competition . 
However , despite the negative advertisements on both sides , the three national televised debates raised important questions in a format and have been widely followed . 
In general , any president in benefiting from economic growth is likely to be re elected . 
In this , the real surprise of Bush's was the small margin of majority . 
In large part, this is due to the unpopularity of the Iraq war.
Kerry tried to turn the war , the low rate of job creation , and Bush's insufficient medical coverage and tax credits for the privileged into central issues in the campaign , but some observers felt that this failed to send a clear message . 
Mr Bush countered that with the issue of security against terrorism and a cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion.
Finally, cultural populism and security have won out against the economic populism.
The interpretation of the elections was influenced by the exit polls in which voters had to decide having voted on the issues that mattered the most for them .
The majority (22%) said the "moral values", by comparison only 20% have cited the economy and 19% terrorism.
Social conservatives have interpreted this to mean that they won Mr . Bush's election , and that their should dominate his second term . 
However, a Pew poll carried out a week after the election indicated that the category of "moral values" embrace a variety of issues in addition to the rights to abortion and gay marriage.
In fact , polls show that 25 of the public supports gay marriage and 35 are in favour of legal civil unions law gay couples a position that Mr Kerry defended . 
However , for the 37 who oppose gay marriage , in particular in the États in the centre , the issue has enabled them to rally supporters of Mr Bush to make them come to the polls . 
Still, overall, if the United States are divided beyond any hope.
The electoral map États red and blue birth given to Internet États humoristiques designs on birth secession of the two blue coast from the country's red centre 
Some call this côtopie . 
But the divisions are not so clear.
In both camps , many États were won by narrow room and if one were to color États cards by county rather than État , most of États country turns purple . 
Cities versus suburbs and rural areas would be a better description of the situation instead of versus the coast the . 
Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are gathered in the moderate middle of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes.
But the political elites , such as political activists and members of Congress , tend to be more extremists than the public . 
At first this seems odd , since they should feel attracted by the centre , rich in voice . 
However, many members of Congress represent districts that are granted to their party and the real threat to their re-election is the party primaries, dominated by the wings of the most militant and extreme parties.
This trend is reinforced by the rise of the cable TV, which draws viewers through more controversial plans to info-divertissement, and those who called chronic Internet blogs, starting in the controversial persistent, without any editorial filter.
A reform that would change the boundaries of congressional districts to make them more competitive can respond to this problem , few are chosen will vote for changes that could increase the risk of defeat .
The narrow margin of the results suggests that Mr . Bush does not really possess the margin of he really won . 
Faced with difficult issues in foreign policy , fiscal and dociale , it would be wise to turn towards the centre rather than to reconcile its conservative base , but the policy that will prevail between conviction or the pragmatic policy remains uncertain .

Let's not use oil anymore ! 
Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the fight against global warming the priority of the German presidencies of the European Union and the G8, which begin in January.
His finished proposal is general enough that leaders recognize accept it , clear enough for other governments businesses to understand it at the next G8 summit , it will simply set a date from which vehicles running on gas will no longer be registered in the major industrialized countries .
This decision will have a significant positive impact at geopolitical and economic . 
Today , the real concern in terms of energy is not related to the decrease of world oil reserves , the decline in domestic production of the largest consumers Europe , USA and China even as growing demand in Asia continues in the market .
The available reserves will be concentrated more in the Middle East , because those in the other parts of the world will soon dry up . 
Moreover, the major oil exporters are not prepared to submit their investment policies to market conditions.
Saudi Arabia wants to manage only its oil production and, for its part, Iran is afraid to potential investors with its bureaucratic obstacles and corruption.
Iraq suffers a lack of security , while foreigners are thwarted at every attempt to investment in Russia . 
These four États contain half the world's oil reserves , of which États thirds could half be exported . 
These factors , except for the of costs , are the cause of elevated oil prices and costs race for the contracts in Africa and Central Asia costs 
The belief that rising oil prices is good for the environment does not take account of the basic data of international politics.
First , in most poor countries in Africa and Asia import oil represent a greater part of national spending than in industrialized countries , which means that economic growth and social development are compromise , which may lead to new debt crises . 
Oil production are hampering reforms in the pensions exporting exporters . 
Thanks to the in their financial muscle , such as those in Venezuela and Iran are feeling less constrained by the international rules . 
The latest arrivals among major consumer consuming countries , such as China , mimic the old consumer of the industrialized West and their long tradition of turning a blind consumer to violations of human order , to secure consumer contracts with authoritarian regimes and oil oil rich . 
Only the political and economic heavyweights , the industrialized countries which are by far the main consumer of oil , can initiate change on a global world . 
It is important to begin with the transport sector, which currently accounts for more than half the oil consumption -- a level which will certainly increase in the future.
Therefore , the G8 countries must agree not to register new gasoline powered petrol beginning in 2025 . 
This decision is not directed against individual individual , but against the waste of a scarce individual whose priority is to produce synthetic materials . 
Politicians in should not show toward one technology or another . 
Instead , they should encourage the car industry to develop alternative technologies that use biofuels car éthylène , hydrogen , and even natural gas for car period of transition . 
The countries that have opened the door to the political will on this , as a side benefit , have placed their national industries in first place in energy technology to ensure the future markets . 
The expected significant reduction of CO2 emissions could ultimately lead to progress in international climate policies.
Economic development also comes into play If we treat our addiction to oil , poorer and less developed and newly industrialized countries , could be more , which would lower prices and calm the energy competition .
At the geopolitical , benefits would be equally significant , notably that major oil benefits would be much less able to blackmail industrialized countries benefits 
This change would increase the strength of negotiating of the international community in the Middle East strengthening the social forces countries such as Saudi Arabia , Iran Russia , who want to seriously promote economic political reforms .
A producer car producing with advanced technology , Germany producer car situated to launch such an initiative . 
Angela Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and began her political career in the post of Environment Minister -- presiding over the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1995 -- would be more credible than any other members of the European Union and the G8 summit in tackling the problem.
It is time to perform a political act of bravery.

The myth of humanitarian aid and trade
Humanitarian aid and trade have become words . 
Increased humanitarian aid (accompanied by a debt relief) and better access to markets in rich countries for the products of poor countries: it now seems to be at the top of the international agenda.
In fact , the debate today is no longer about what to do , the extent of actions to take how quickly they are taken .
Lost in all this: the obvious lessons to be learned from the last five decades of economic development.
At the forefront of these lessons, we find that economic development is left largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.
The countries that have done pretty well in recent history have succeeded thanks to their own efforts.
Humanitarian aid and the markets have played only a minor role.
Take the example of a developing country which has a free and preferential access to its larger neighbour's , which also happened to be the most powerful economy in the world . 
Suppose that more country are able to send millions of its citizens to country across the border , receives a huge volume of country investment and is fully integrated into the international production country . 
Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its wealthy neighbour and its willingness to intervene as lender of last resort.
Globalization does not flourish under better than those , does it not ? 
Let us now consider a second country.
It faces a trade embargo with the world's largest market , receives neither foreign aid nor any form from the Western world , is excluded from international organisations as the WTO , and cannot borrow from the IMF and World Bank . 
If these handicaps were not debilitating enough , you can add handicaps economy that maintains interview own barriers against international trade in handicaps form of trade État barriers to imports handicaps quantitative restrictions . 
As the reader was able to guess , these really exist . It takes in Mexico and Vietnam . 
Mexico share a long border of 3 miles with the United States , which offers not only the privileged access to a market of goods and labour , but also a proportion of the US Treasury as the experience of the peso crisis in 1995 has shown . 
However, America has maintained its trade embargo against the Vietnam until 1994, has not restored diplomatic relations before 1995 and has granted the status of the nation most favoured to the Vietnamese imports many years later.
Vietnam has not yet entered the WTO.
Now let's look look their economic performance . 
Since the signing of NAFTA in December 1992 , the Mexican economy has experienced an average annual growth of just over 1 head . 
Not only this figure is well below the rate of the champions of the Asian economy, but it is only a fraction of the performance of growth capital in Mexico for decades before the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).
Vietnam , however , has experienced an annual increase of 5 . 6 per between the stages of its economic reforms in 1988 and the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1995 and has experienced rapid growth continued at a rate of 4 . 5 since . 
Vietnam has witnessed a dramatic decline of poverty while Mexico has suffered a fall in real wages.
These two countries have experienced a takeoff of international trade and foreign investment , but the picture is very different where it matters most in improving living standards , particularly among the poor . 
What these examples demonstrate is that a country's domestic efforts overshadows all other elements in the determination of its economic fortunes . 
All that The American market had to offer in Mexico has not been able to offset the impact of policy mistakes on the internal market, particularly the inability to overturn the real appreciation of the exchange rate of the peso or extend the productivity gains achieved in an area close to export business to the rest of the economy.
What matters most is the adoption by a country of an appropriate growth strategy.
Without any of the benefits from which Mexico benefited , Vietnam has pursued a benefits centered around diversifying its economy and improving the production capacity benefits local suppliers . 
The overall experience of the post war evidence the that domestic policies are matters most . 
South Korea took off in the early 1960's 1960s not when foreign subsidies at their height , 1960s when they began to dry up . 
Taiwan has not benefited from foreign aid or privileged access to certain markets.
China and India, the economic superstars of our time, have prospered largely through their own efforts at economic reform.
It is tempting to put on the account of foreign demand for their products for export , the rare success in Africa , Botswana and Mauritius respectively diamonds and clothing , but this cannot go very far . 
Évidemment , these two countries would be much poorer without Évidemment to foreign markets . 
But as in all cases of successful development , what distinguishes exercises is not the external benefits they enjoy , but their ability to exploit these advantages . 
It is enough to see how other countries have wasted the advantage that their purchase resources gives them . 
The word 'diamond' does not particularly bring to mind an image of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.
Similarly , few exports proliferating around the world have experienced the level of exports observed in Mauritius . 
This does not relieve the rich countries from their obligation to help.
They can make life harder for corrupt dictators, sharing more financial information and refusing to acknowledge the international contracts they sign.
Similarly , the of the number of workers in poor countries allowed to work in rich countries and a wider range of policies that focus on growth thanks to the relaxation of rules and conditions of the WTO imposed by the United States would produce a greater impact on long term development . 
It hasn't been proven that expanded access to markets and subsidies represents the best use of the Northern Hemisphere's political capital.
Development should focus on improving the environment in poor countries , rather than on aid and trade .

Interdependencies 
If the great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today , he would no doubt wonder if the world had been turned upside down . 
His hugely influential theory of dependency argued that if poor countries relied too dependency on materials , they would never dependency the industrial levels necessary to sustain rapid growth . 
They would get stuck instead in a round of global decline of commodity prices and reducing the round of income . 
The answer to Prebisch's favourite, protectionism, has been disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that have followed it.
But the fact is that , for years , Prebisch seems to have had the right reaction about long term prices trends . 
Continual efficiency gains in agriculture and natural extraction have resources the prices of commodity , especially in the 1980s and 1990s . 
À a few exceptions, the countries that have focused on exports of raw materials have been poor results, while the Asian countries with few resources have made rapid progress.
Today, however, with the Giants in Asia, India and China, joining the world economy, prices of petrol, gold, wheat and virtually all other raw materials are soaring.
Yes, there will always be rounds (the price of oil, for example, will no doubt again before starting his rise) but the long-term trend many raw materials will remain clear for some time yet.
What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to recognize yet , while Prebisch would have realized right away is that this sudden turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of powers .
Indeed, no other aspect of economic globalization will give greater challenges to the leaders of the world over the coming decades.
There are many questions.
Are today's rich countries prepared to enter a period of co dependency in which they will all be as equally desperately seeking raw materials as the developing countries are seeking industrial products and technologies ? 
Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to countries producers produce raw materials as these get richer ? 
How the two superpowers of the world , China and the United States , will manage the fact that significant exporting areas of raw materials in Africa and the Middle East into Central Asia are covered by States nations poorly trained ? 
Some self anointed prophets portray the problem as that limits finite nature reserves and claim that the most critical raw materials are declining at an alarming rate . 
Nowadays, many are followers of the theory "of the peak of Hubbert 'production of oil, which supports that we have reached the limits of our production capacities, the wells are drying up and that the situation could deteriorate.
However, as indicated by the eminent oil historian Dan Yergin , the prophets of doom have boasted that the resources in black gold were about to run dry at least four times already.
Each time , radical technological advances have À these threats evaporate . 
À the of the 1800s , drilling drilling oil meant dredging À mulets . 
Today , drilling 3 , 000 metres soil the oceans is old . 
Such moves have also been made in the areas extraction metals and agriculture . 
No , the world is not facing a shortage of raw materials in the near . 
In reality , it happens that the integration of 2 . 5 billion people China and India into the world economy produced a shift in demand likely to put far more pressure on rising rise raw commodity any technology gain likely to be able to balance . 
Therefore , for at least 50 to 75 years , and perhaps even people start to drill on Mars in the centuries to come , the prices of many natural resources will rise .
Will the new balance of economic forces that would result from it destabilise the political situation?
The First World War was partly triggered by Germany's concerns about other colonial colonial cornering too much of the world's oil and raw materials . 
Similarly , during World War II , Japan feared for the stability of its supplies of deals and other natural resources from abroad . 
Will such tensions arise between resource challenged China where even water scarcity is a problem and the West ? 
Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, particularly in light of the approach as sober as practical problems of resources to their country displayed by the Chinese leaders.
The Chinese are turning to regions like Africa in the hope of finding stable trading partners . 
They do not share the political evangelism of Americans, who do not only want to trade with commodity exporters, but also want to convert them.
Then there are those American leaders who still talk about making the United States self sufficient in terms of energy resources . 
This is a joke sufficient , perhaps , but self sufficient , never . 
Much of the Arab world view, and it is understandable, the invasion of Iraq is the cornerstone of the US strategy to get hold of energy resources stable.
If they are right , we can only hope that America has a fallback . 
Meanwhile , commodity prices will continue to grow , and oil exporters constitute the biggest contributors to the trade gap of the United States . 
Perhaps the real American strategy is to try to exporters so much money to the oil exporting that they will become dependent on the happiness they provide to America ! 
This is a turning point that Prebisch would never have expected.

Iran's radical choice
The choice of Iranians to bring to power the mayor of Tehran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad risk risks deteriorating relations with the West and increasing isolation of the country at the international level . 
However , in terms of national policy , the Islamist regime will probably be better than if a more moderate candidate prevailed . 
It is clear that Ahmadinejad has a real support base.
The fact that he ran as a populist , that he talked about helping the poor , condemned the government , and acted almost like an opposition candidate does not count he embodied choice regime and eventually received official aid even against rivals radicals . 
The regime has shown great skill.
It has transformed the candidate a little more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, disagree with some government policies, in a person in harmony with the established order, and its own candidate in a rebel.
The government has used the resentment against the establishment to consolidate its own power.
Étant given that the former president Mohammad Khatami, argued the reformist movement, to me if there was little foolhardy and that it has finally done nothing, it makes that point to how leaders have returned to their advantage in the political situation.
Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists of the anti-Shah revolution of 25 years ago.
He is directly involved in the of American hostages in Iran , though we really don't know to what point 
Most disturbing is that it is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran the guardians Islamic Revolutionary revolution and the Basij . 
The first is an army parall to the pro-régime; the second is an organisation which will intimidate opponents and anyone who is seeking a more open society.
However, this concern that Iran is in the hands of  even more radical leaders is mitigated by two factors.
First , Ahmadinejad will likely focus probl national , and try without any indication probl his chances of succ to improve the lives probl poorest Iranians . 
mement , the group in power since the revolution will mement to control both the ideological étrang foreign mement 
The president has less power than it seems, and he is particularly dwarfed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Nevertheless, the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad makes CR to lying to the challenge that Iran poses to the Western policy and the stability of the Middle East.
First , it sends the signal to the more extreme elements of Iran customers terrorists in this country the Lebanese Hezbollah , Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , and several smaller groups who are working against Saudi Arabia , Iraq and other Arab countries they have the go ahead to launch their attacks . 
They will probably assume that Iran will support them, whatever they do.
Apparently, Iran has often shown itself to be relatively cautious, while secretly playing the role of global financial backer of terror.
Iranian officials have , individually , acted to command coordinate specific operations , they will now feel freer to do so .
Beside , Ahmadinejad openly advocates an intensive programme for obtaining nuclear weapons . 
Most Iranian politicians , at least those allowed by the government to act openly , supports the , but favor a discreet , prudent . 
Rafsanjani , for example , establishment establishing better relations with the West before breakthrough establishment the nuclear front . 
If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran , he is more likely to haphazardly use the haphazard . 
This does not mean he would actually use them , rather that he would make use of them for purposes of diplomatic blackmail , raising his threats to crisis levels .
Since Iranian leaders proclaim daily their desire to wipe Israel off the map and fight the United States Ahmadinejad stepped on the image of an American flag he went voting , the risk of confrontation has increased .
Finally , Ahmadinejad is likely to make bolder to the point of endangering the stability of Iraq , and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremist Iraqis . 
Iran has already sent a of agents to Iraq and supports clients who seek to transform this country into its clone . 
The Iraqis , including Shiite Muslims , who follow the same of Islam as Iranians , generally reject such interference . 
position more militant Iranian may increase friction with Iraq , position will inspire more anti American violence . 
In short, the outcome of the Iranian elections is dangerous, even if its potential will depend on the actions of Ahmadinejad and the degree of power that will Khamenei give him.
In addition , dealing with such an openly extremist Iran even radical according to the of an already harsh will be a challenge not only for the United States , but also for Europe . 
Will the European countries continue to claim that the militant rhetoric and provocations of Ahmadinejad do not count and that it is possible to find diplomatic overtures to Iran's nuclear ambitions ? 
With Rafsanjani, a real agreement, or at least the appearances of cooperation, would have been easy to maintain.
But, with Ahmadinejad, it will take a huge dose of conciliation to maintain even the most minimal diplomatic procedure.
Some reformists and Iranian exiles welcome the election of Ahmadinejad, because they believe that his administration is more likely to show the true face of the regime and crush any hope of compromise in the West.
But it can also embody the succ to the regime to return to his advantage the discontent caused by a quarter of whether to clear of GNE Islamist radical.
Whatever the consequences, the victory of Ahmadinejad means for the West that everything in Iran will become even more sensitive.

Take from the poor, give to the rich
President Bush seems about to destroy the US budget for the coming years.
When President Bush took office , there were forecasts of anticipated budget surpluses for as long as one could see . 
Today , thanks to a mixture of irresponsible tax cuts initiated by Republicans , an economic slowdown , the of the stock market bubble and a massive increase in military spending , the fiscal outlook is dominated by large deficits . 
The worst is yet to come, because the Bush administration and congressional Republican majority are preparing to worsen the fiscal mess.
Their will likely weaken the U . devastation . and increase instability in the international economy . 
Usually, America's Republican Party called for balanced budgets.
That changed with the Reagan administration, when conservative Republicans were in favour of tax cuts, even when it was done achieved large budget deficits.
President Reagan announced to the American people that he could enjoy both tax cuts , the strengthening of the Army and the continuation of their favourite spending programmes . 
The result , unsurprisingly , was a series of significant budget deficits elimination took several years to eliminate . 
President George Bush senior and president Bill Clinton had to raise taxes in order to bring order to the Reagan era's chaos.
These tax increases have probably contributed to the defeat of George H . W . Bush by Bill Clinton in 1992 . 
However , Clinton valiantly decided to finish the process of restoring fiscal balance , in part to protect long term funding pensions for Social Security . 
Clinton quitta the presidency in 2000, the situation was at best for decades.
Then came President George Bush's son , ready to act as Reagan with significant tax cuts , a considerable increase in military spending and the continuation and even the development of popular spending programmes . 
The result was predictable.
In January 2001, the cumulative budget projections for the years 2002 to 2011 anticipated a budget surplus of $5.6 billion.
Mid-2002, these anticipated surpluses had evaporated.
In À light of these new economic conditions , and in À shadow of the war against Iraq , one might À that the Bush administration and the Republican Congress À careful in defence of new tax cuts . 
But far from it , their main priority is to set up more tax cuts which will mostly benefit the part . 
At the same time, the government calls for significant increases in military spending.
With the approach of the presidential election in November 2004 , one approach be certain that no significant reduction in spending will approach in the non military programmes . 
So it seems that the massive budget deficits are destined to continue.
If domestic spending just stays constant , at a fraction of national income , it appears that projections cumulative budget next years result in an overall deficit of 1 . 5 trillion . 
But this figure could be very optimistic , because it doesn't truly take into the cost of a likely war against Iraq , nor another tax package cuts nor the risk of rising interest rates for the coming years . 
Why do Republicans seem so little concerned by this ? 
Some Republicans are more concerned about tax cuts for the wealthy than about anything else.
Others believe that the deficits will lead by force to significant in government spending at home , thus reducing State État , which is their most cherished hope . 
The problem with this analysis is that most taxpayers are attached to the social programmes and will not easily support large cuts in spending.
The most intriguing remains as to why Americans vote for such policies when remains should know that it will probably result in problems . 
One of the possible answers is the fact that many voters do not see the budgetary problems coming.
A better answer is that most Americans have not actually voted for these policies.
The turnout of the election in 2002 was only 40% of voters, and only around half of these 40% voted for Republicans, that is approximately 20% of people entitled to vote.
Of course , the prospects need not be so bleak . 
The war against Iraq could perhaps be avoided.
Tax cuts could be either modest or dismissed.
But I predict huge budget deficits for years to come and a growing sense of unease within the USA and abroad about the macroeconomic situation of America . 
Foreign investors could decide to reduce their funding from the government budget and leave the current deficit on better . 
The dollar may weaken, and the fear of inflation could become even more pronounced.
It will lose confidence in politicians of États-unis which will be less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.
The poor , in the United States and abroad , could suffer the most , since President Bush and Congress say to the American people and the world that there is no funds available to address the question of poverty , health and education , because of the huge budget deficits . 
If the average American does not open his eyes to these taxation risks , the wealthy could benefit from another gift of several billion dollars while the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for the coming years .

Lessons to learn from America's tax . 
George W. Bush did far more to destroy the economic policy of the United States that all the other presidents in American history, surpassing even his mentor Ronald Reagan.
In only three years in office, he destroyed a fragile political consensus that demanded ten years of effort and may require another decade to be rebuilt.
In doing so , Bush has risked the health and social stability of America in the long term health 
Given the budgetary challenges in the long term that manage the US with an extremely awkward are not the only existing challenges , the Tax blunder of America offer important lessons to other countries . 
The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily be temporarily popular by lowering taxes and increasing government spending while accumulating massive public debt and leaving their repayment to the future elected representatives.
This strategy may take a few years , but emerging budget deficits growing public debt impose a painful policy .
a however politician can buy his re election and perhaps be away on retirement already when the crisis comes .
One might think that , after decades of similar episodes of political policy throughout the world , voters would have a negative to this type of ruse . 
However , Bush is doing it again by buying popularity through distributing massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing popularity on the military , education , and health . 
The budget deficit reached amounts to more than 5% of GDP.
Worse , the long term budgetary outlook of America were already worrying before Bush begins to outlook its policies foolhardy . 
The U . S . population is aging , so much so that systems of pension and health care costs money by public will increase dramatically . 
Detailed calculations show that the revenue that will be available through the fiscal policies advocated by Bush may not achieve the dozens of trillion dollars, which represent the costs of pensions, healthcare and other fiscal spending expected by the population.
At some point in the future, we will need to greatly increase the recovery of taxes, drastically reducing public spending, or both, to compensate for the actions of Bush.
So why the population support his policies?
Because she understands little about these long term consequences or is not very concerned about them , even if these consequences will eventually have an impact on the majority of Americans . 
The richest taxpayers are of course happy because they have enjoyed the bulk of tax cuts.
As surprising it may seem , the 5 richest U . S . taxpayers had received about half the tax cuts , and those rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95 middle class and poor majority to bear future spending cuts and tax increases .
Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor voters and voters in the middle classes that they should also be satisfied with their fate, without saying they will have to pay their small tax cuts by cuts far larger future government services, if the policies of his administration to prevail over the long term.
If the Americans had a memory, they would realize that they have already climbed this "roller coaster" tax over the last 20 years.
Ronald Reagan also came to office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending.
That ended in an enormous budget deficit in the mid-1980s.
The Reagan tax cuts were extremely popular and allowed him to be re-elected in 1984.
It then took a decade (from the second term of Ronald Reagan until the mandates of George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton) to return to a budget surplus.
Of course , this result required the approval of new tax increases , which cost her re election to George Bush Sr . and led to the polarized of the 1990s . 
History is likely to repeat itself.
Some right wing ideologues in the Bush administration predict that the current budget deficits will bring on ultimately a drastic reduction in the social costs of government . 
They hope to dismantle programmes such as Social Security and Medicare.
But the American people strongly support these social programmes . 
the strategy that first cuts taxes in order to lead to further cuts in social programs is doomed to failure and will inevitably increase tax rates .
Other Bush administration ideologues argue that tax cuts play a crucial in getting the US out of the recession . 
This argument is also wrong.
America's economy could recover without tax cuts, and perhaps even more solidly.
In all cases , It is a huge mistake to long term fiscal on the short term economic cycle . 
The other countries have two key lessons to learn from this situation.
The first is that the imminent budget deficits in the US will sooner or later limit the international power of America.
Americans supported the war in Iraq only because they did not have to pay for higher taxes.
When the Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less inclined to support expensive  military operations abroad.
Indeed, the US will be deeply split internally as the population will be grappling with the fiscal mess left by Bush.
The second lesson is that countries need to plan their budgets according to fiscal costs congruent with an aging population.
The long term budgetary budget are rarely taken into account by the taxpayers or budget . 
Governments should be forced to submit budgetary assessments on the long term at the same time their annual budget proposals to reduce the trend towards a political manipulation on the short term of the budget.
The US can play the role of an alarm to the other countries.
The White House should give the other countries the same council as the one given by magicians on television to their viewers Do not try to do this at home .

The politicisation of the securities markets 
Many economic and financial analysts complain that the securities markets in emerging countries are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.
In contrast , a primitive economic force regulates the securities markets in advanced countries , to predict their performance is tantamount to predicting the growth of trees .
This description of the securities markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just partial, because the same description applies to the securities markets in advanced countries.
Indeed, the best analysts know that to predict the performance of the securities market of any country is basically to predict the extent to which the government wishes that the investors in securities markets be involved in the current political environment.
Take the securities market in America, by far the biggest in the world.
The government leaves companies alone , and returns on investment in U . S . securities markets reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy .
This partly explains why the US attracts portfolio investors worldwide.
But the returns that make the U . S . securities markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance . 
In particular , tax rates which affect securities have varied over time along with change in political pressure . 
During the second world war, for example, the political support for big fortunes had dwindled and the government has sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends and high incomes in general.
When the second world war helped to improve significantly the economy weakened by the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Roosevelt and Congress have introduced a tax on the windfall profits to ensure that shareholders do not bring a benefit too big.
By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the securities market was down, American voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man considered by many as too far to the right to be president.
He asked for , and obtained , taxes on capital gains , dividends and income . 
Political interference in the securities market is not aimed only at taxes on capital gains, dividends and income.
Property taxes , taxes , import duties , and sales taxes , which are paid , directly or indirectly , by companies , can have a magnified impact on corporate profits and therefore on the securities market . 
This is no coincidence that wherever develop of the securities markets, governments to ensure that these lower taxes on corporate profits after tax.
Indeed, the policies of the securities markets are not limited to taxes.
Instead, almost every activity of the government affects corporate profits and, subsequently, the securities market.
After the crash of the securities markets in 1929, the American government suspended a large part of the antitrust activity that allowed companies to gain a monopoly which would increase their value.
This policy delayed the reduction from high rate , but not enough reduction control the political rate deployed to support the reduction market . 
Similarly , one of the most important actions taken by President Reagan was to destroy lot of the American unions' remaining power , which competed for their share of the industrial . 
The victory won by Ronald Reagan during the strike of air traffic controllers in 1981 was a major turning point for the American trade union movement, and also for the securities market which launched its spectacular market rise in 1982.
The American government has been particularly hard hit to support the stock market of shifting since the culmination of the illusion of share prices in 2000 , and particularly to cut interest rates repeatedly . 
Of course, this measure was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, and not in terms of support for the securities market.
But it is very revealing the extent of the American market for securities that one of the most important factors weighing on the economy is the falling price of shares.
Indeed , the of the authorities was not limited to a monetary stimulus . 
The national accounts of products and income from the United States show that the effective tax rate on corporate profits (the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in the form of taxes) rose in Crete to 33.7% during the first quarter of 2000 (a record in the securities market and economy in general) and has dropped to 20.2% during the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was low.
A large part of this decline reflects the tax relief package passed by Congress and the perception among businesses that in the current economic and political environment , they can be more combatives about avoiding paying taxes . 
Moreover, after the crash of the securities market, the maximum tax on dividends on securities has fallen from 35% to 15%, providing a new, substantial benefit to investors on the long term and intensifying the combined effect of the reinvestment of dividends after tax.
Again, this tax cut was justified to stimulate the economy which can, of course, apply to virtually every measure to support the securities market.
But it is the balance of political forces that determines the credibility of this kind of justification.
One could argue that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a trade union movement, have worked in the United States over the past 200 years and that they should continue to operate in the future, producing high returns on the securities markets and attracting foreign capital inflows.
Those who believe that investment in the US market securities will follow the same higher growth trend for decades could well be right.
But it is very important to be clear on what we predicted.
The forecasts are primarily not only on the economy but also on policy, even on the cultural values, that are shaping the political and economic performance.

The housing market at a global 
There is no investment more local than investing in property . The residence you are buying is rooted in a specific location , like a tree , and or languishes in keeping with local economic conditions . 
The whole world across our television screens , but the housing market , made up almost exclusively of local , rarely crosses geographical boundaries . 
Soon, however, this could change.
In a month , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME , in collaboration with my company MacroMarkets and with Fiserv and Standard amp ; Poor's , will launch the options on futures in house prices in 10 cities in the États unis . 
The contracts will be based on the indices amp ; P Case Shiller home price , established in terms indices speculative research that my colleague Karl Case and indices carried out 20 years ago . 
We have long been campaigning for a housing futures market , no exchange , until now , wanted to use these indexes to create such a market .
Futures markets for house prices will allow investors world to invest house in the U . S . real estate house . 
A buyer in Paris, Rio de Janeiro or Tokyo will have the opportunity to invest in homes occupied by their owners in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, among others.
One of the fundamental principles of financial theory -- diversification and risk-spreading -- means that interest in these new contracts will be strong.
Businesses and residents of New York , for example , are overexposed to local estate . However , by selling their homes , they should be able to reduce these risks . 
Investors in Tokyo will assume some risk by buying housing in New York if the price is right . 
New Yorkers will continue to live in their homes, while diversifying their investment risk throughout the world.
The experience of a genuine market to run on homes uni-familiales has not been retentée since 1991, when the London future and options exchange (called now euronext.liffe) has missed the start of such a market.
This has never generated large volumes of transactions . 
The stock market launched a concept that didn't convince . 
The UK markets of Paris diversified on house prices, like some online retail markets, did not bring much either.
Will it be different this time?
Of course, the launch of a new market is still uncertain. People are interested in an idea if it attracted a lot of others; if no one is impressive, it will attract more.
The same goes for the markets. If there is no investors interested, there will not be enough business to generate profits to attract others.
However , like all good ideas , we never know very well why they attract . Also , we cannot predict the launch of this new market , but we know that sometimes the success is place . 
Original indicators suggest that the growing interest in term transactions as regards house prices, especially because of the current speech on the "housing bubble", stresses the importance of risk diversification.
After the announcement of the CME , one of its competitors , the Chicago Board Options Exchange , unveiled its project to create options on futures in the largest American , based on average real estate prices published by the National Association of Realtors National Association of Estate Agents . 
However , in addition to the strong public interest in real property investment and cover the risks , another thorny issue must be settled for the futures markets work well prices must be publicly disclosed and investors should understand its meaning . 
I believe that there are great opportunities eventually these markets lead to a drop in the prices in certain American cities .
It will be a of déport , as traders say . Today , the déport on the market is lower than the price déport property . 
Presumably , the déport will not appear the first day of real property transactions déport but it should happen within a few months . 
We may need to offset if some of these markets actually fulfill their duties.
Everyone knows that these cities have experienced a huge real estate boom in recent years (besides, this is a widespread global phenomenon).
International investors do not seem very keen to invest in those cities, without the prospect of falling prices, based on the futures markets. The inhabitants of Tokyo have learned this to their expense.
Therefore If the offset is important enough , even the investors who believe that the US housing market is declining can still expect a good return on home prices , because they already have a lower price on the futures market .
However, New Yorkers will need to make some adjustments to cover their own property investments, if they want to sell futures and, of course, lower prices.
They will be at the idea that the market has already anticipated this decline, and that they cannot protect itself from the tiny margin potential that exceeds the anticipation.
In fact , such adjustments in our way of thinking will certainly occur we closely watch future market prices .
Until now , the development of housing prices has mainly been the result of diverse . 
When the market will create an international consensus on house prices in market the major cities around the world , it would be market to manage the risks they face in stabilizing both market economies and our own standards of living .

But what moves the market ? 
Since the 10 May, most of the global markets have shown strong cumulative declines, particularly in two weeks on 23 May, with average prices persist.
Are concerns for the global stock markets synonymous with concerns for the global world ? 
Let us consider the more pronounced reductions.
Among the major countries, the crash the most impressive is that of India, where prices have fallen 16.9% between the 10 May and May 22.
The debacle of the other side of the world has become almost as important. There, the ups and downs were only a few days apart from those of India: in Argentina, prices have fallen by 16.1%, in Brazil by 14.7% and Mexico by 13.8%.
The European markets have also suffered big losses.
In Sweden, prices plummeted by 15.2% between May 9 and 22; over practically the same period, they were down 9.7% in Germany, 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom, and 9.3% in Italy.
In Asia, prices fell by 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong and 8% in Japan within roughly the same period.
Many commentators are trying to link these events to the situation in the United States . 
However, the Americans have only owned up to a drop of 5.2% between May 9th and May 24th.
China does not appear to be behind this global downturn since the prices have risen there during this period.
The standard explanations of the economists monetary policies . 
In the wake of the great fear of deflation in 2003, central banks worldwide have cut interest rates, causing speculative explosions in the housing markets and the stock market.
But today , one believes this perspective , interest rate increases will begin to bite , which suggests further declines in asset prices .
There is certainly an important element of truth in this argument.
The Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates on the 10th and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, has indicated that further increases could happen in the future.
On May 17 , a worsening in US data was detected , which suggests a worsening durcissements monetary policy . 
Economists like to think the world is logical and manageable, which means that they understand what is happening there.
But by doing that, they often overstate the role of central banks.
Indeed, the increase in American rates was just another one in a series of rate increases -- the 16th in a row.
No other major central bank has increased its rates after the start of the decline in stock markets in May until around the 7th or 8th of June, when several did (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey).
Another factor: the price of oil, which has increased by 24% between March 22 and May 2, beating all records.
That would undoubtedly be a major event capable of influencing the markets worldwide.
The oil price rises are playing the role of the culprit in almost all the economic recessions since World War II.
And yet the sky high oil prices do not match when asset prices having fallen, in mid-May.
To argue that these increases have led to declines markets assumes a gap of several weeks . 
But the stock markets are not very logical , and a mistimed to the oil price shock might be possible . 
As with all way in any financial market , an increase always way attention . 
When oil prices are rising rapidly , people watch information on it and discuss among themselves these increases , thus creating a greater sensitivity to these . 
The crisis in the Middle East is tied to oil prices , which dominated the during the information of May . 
Signs of doom and the strong language used by various political figures were amplified in investors' spirit in oil price rises 
On May 8th , Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres , in response to hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , struck back , saying that The Iranian president should remember that Iran also could be wiped off the map . 
Similarly , around the beginning of the fall of the stock market in May , Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia , the country with the greatest number of Muslims in the world , and newspapers reported on 13th May that he had received a standing ovation from students of two of the best universities in the country . 
This story might have been interpreted as proof that Ahmadinejad's strategy of brinkmanship in the nuclear proof reaped him political dividends , fueling a perception proof the tense situation in the Middle East could lead proof further in the price of oil rises 
These articles in newspapers can seem far more remote from the stock markets than the monetary policy.
But the public reaction that they spark , and the recent increases in oil prices , could go a long measure in changing market psychology . 
Attitudes towards over time , and events like the remarks of Ahmedinejad and Peres can precipitate those changes . 
So, although these events are difficult to quantify, perhaps the analysts also should pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad as Bernanke when they try to understand the direction of the stock markets worldwide.
Economists do not perhaps enjoy concentrating on the mentality of the public and how it interacts with price fluctuations , world and the of . 
This would mean that economic events are less predictable and economists less omniscients than they might like to imagine . 
However, intuitif it would be logical to do so.
What are head really investor ? 
Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure, not Bernanke.
Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure, not Bernanke.
And perhaps the most important, Ahmadinejad has a destabilizing influence, not Bernanke.
Whatever their final cause, the world's stock drops in mid-May indicate an instable market psychology.
Hard to believe that they were only linked to opinions relating to potential monetary policies , and not to broader and deeper issues , especially as regards energy and political tension , which are the foundations of performance global economy's .

Why pay more for fair trade?
Marks amp ; Spencer , the chain of supermarkets and clothing , owner of 400 shops across Britain , has just announced that it would convert its full range of cafes and thés including 38 different products to the fair trade , logo marketing symbol of ethical production . 
The chain already sells only tea and coffee this label in its 200 Cafe Revive coffee shops . 
It also encourages the purchase of shirts and other goods made from fair trade fair . 
The announcement took place during the half trade Fortnight . During these two weeks half products , presentation sessions were held half producers in developing countries to explain to Britons how half form commerce trade has helped their communities . 
The movement toward more ethical consumption has also enjoyed a significant advance in the United States . Consumers are turning increasingly to organic or locally produced food , such as eggs from free range chickens . 
In the UK, a study has shown that more than 50% of respondents recognised the symbol of fair trade and understood that products bearing that label complied with more working conditions for producers of the developing world.
Currently there is no comparable to the États-unis study, but the data reported and discussions with my own students suggests that the figure would be less expensive for Americans.
Traders willing to obtain fair trade certification  must pay producers a price covering the costs of a sustainable production and a living wage.
For example , the minimum prices for a pound of coffee is 1 . minimum prices regardless of the declining levels of the market . 
If the market price goes beyond that figure , the relative tariff on fair trade will increase and remain higher than 5 cents pound . 
For small producers, they should organize themselves into cooperatives, or other types of groups that allow for democratic participation.
The plants and factories can claim the label fair trade if they offer a decent wage their workers, if they comply with health standards, environmental and safety, if they allow the unions or any other form associations of workers, if they provide accommodation worthy to workers who are far from home and if they use or forced labour, or the work in childhood.
However, not everyone supports fair trade.
Brink Lindsey , Director of the centre for trade policies at the Cato Institute , a pro market , believes that the campaign for the Fairtrade labelled coffee is a dead end paved with good intentions . 
It is in justifying that the real cause the collapse of coffee is not the achievement of excessive profits by multinationals, but in the enormous increase production of coffee in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new technology culture caféière working less and therefore at no cost.
In prospect , if we want to help the coffee prospect , we need to encourage them to abandon prospect and turn to more profitable crops he insists here prospect rightly , on trade restrictions imposed by rich prospect and on the subsidies that are obstacles to be prospect or to products with high added value , such as prospect special cafes can bring a higher . 
What is strange in the arguments of Lindsey, however, is that the campaign to fair-trade coffee seems to do exactly what he calls, encourage the coffee growers to produce special cafes that can be paid more expensive.
Pro market economists do not object to companies that use the appeal of luxury to promote their products . 
If people are prepared to spend $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, because it is the coffee preferred by James Bond, economists do not, in this case, consider that the market is distorted.
So why be so critical of consumers who want to pay 12 for a pound of coffee that they know he has been grown without pesticides , under shaded ombrageux favourable to the survival of birds , by producers who can now feed and educate decently their children ? 
Economists might respond to that that if you want to help people to feed and educate their children , it is possible to buy a book of coffee with an identical for 10 and to give the remaining 2 to a charity , which distributes food and helps scolarise poor children . 
This is indeed a possible strategy . , fair trade has very real advantages .
Producers know that they must produce a coffee appreciated by consumers not only for its liking , but also for the way it is grown . 
If their coffee sells well, they are proud to have made a product that is wanted all around the world.
point the view of growers , receiving a bonus point selling labellisé growers trade is preferable to receiving point charitable charity view they would growers anyway ways whether they point or view and regardless growers the quality of their point . 
Paying more for a product with labellisé fair trade is no more anti market than spending labellisé to buy a product of the Gucci brand . 
Moreover, this label reflects better ethical priorities.
It is not only a grant by governments , its success dependent on market demand and not the lobbysme policy . 
Fortunately, in Europe, this demand is growing rapidly.
Lets hope that it will quickly reach such levels throughout the developed countries, where consumers can decide on their own how to spend their money.

Calves, pigs and American democracy.
Among flood securities on the return of the Democratic majority flood Congress securities the November elections , the result of flood important securities has gone largely unnoticed . 
Although it has highlighted the shortcomings of the American political system, it has also led me to believe again in the compassion of ordinary American citizens.
In Arizona, citizens can, if they have gathered enough signatures, submit a bill to the popular vote.
This year , one of the questions submitted to a ballot box was a law to forbid pens or calves reared for meat be tied sanglés or confined in such a way that prevents them from turning around freely , lying down or extending their states . 
Those who do not know the methods of intensive will perhaps be surprised for the need for such legislation . 
The traditional method , as it is practised around the world there are 50 years ago , and in some countries still today , allows the animals to move and stretch . 
But today , nearly 90 percent of breeding sows the mothers of pigs raised and slaughtered for meat , bacon , and ham spend most of their lives in stalls measure about 60 centimeters by 2 metres 2 . 
They can not turn around , nor extend their legs lying down , nor walk forward or backward more than one step .
They are sometimes tied sanglées to restrict their movements . 
Similarly, calves are confined throughout their lives in individual boxes where they cannot move around, go to bed or stretch.
Essentially, these methods are designed to save on labor costs. They facilitate the management of animals and will employ fewer and less qualified workers.
They also prevent waste wasting energy by moving déplaçdant or by fighting amongst themselves waste 
A few years ago, following protests from animal welfare organisations, the European Commission asked for a report to the standing committee of the EU on intensive farming methods.
The report's conclusions indicate that the animals suffer from the to move and from the boredom of having anything to do for days . 
Of course, common sense can reach the same conclusions.
Following the report, the EU has set the dates from which the confinement of farm animals will be banned.
For the calves, on January 1st, 2007.
Individual stalls for sows , already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden , will be banned starting in 2013 throughout the European Union . 
Measures to improve the welfare of battery hens, high in stack them without enough room to expand their wings are also applied progressively.
We foresee nothing of the in the United States . 
Earlier , when my European friends asked me why the United States evidenced such a delay in welfare animals to Europe , I did not know what to answer . 
If they had insisted, I would have had to admit that one possible explanation was that the Americans cared less about the animals than the Europeans.
Then , in 2002 , groups animals parvinrent getting a banning individual stalls groups sows ban parvinrent submitted to a popular vote . 
To everyone's surprise , the proposal was accepted by 55 percent of voters . 
Last month in Arizona, despite generously funded opposition by the food industry, a ban on confinement boxes for calves and pigs was also approved by 62 percent of voters.
Neither the Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive both voted for George W . Bush against John Kerry in 2004 . 
The results of these two popular vote strongly suggest that if all Americans should decide on vote maintenance of the pregnant sows and veal in containment vote a large majority would be against it . 
Ultimately , it seems that Americans are as concerned as Europeans about cattle's conditions animals 
To explain the difference between the welfare of animals in the US and Europe , it is certainly necessary doubt compare the political systems . 
In Europe , voters' concerns with animals' life have resonated among the resonance of national parliaments life the European Parliament , with the adoption of national life EU directives to improve their lot . 
The United States, those same concerns have had no visible effect on the members of Congress.
There is no federal law on farm animal welfare and virtually no legislation on the États . 
Àb my opinion , the tens of millions of dollars Àb the food industry pocketed by officials seeking to be Àb elected something . 
The animal's movement animals despite a strong popular support , does not have animals in the arena of lobbying and political donations . 
In the American electoral races, money counts more than the views of the voters.
Party discipline is weak , delegates must themselves raise the funds delegates their re election in this case , every two delegates for members of the House of Representatives . 
In Europe, where the discipline of the parties is respected and where the parties, and not the candidates, according to election campaigns money plays a role less important.
In the United States , a country proud of its democratic tradition , calves and pigs are not the only losers by any .

Any on the new army made up entirely of Afghans ? 
The assassination of the Afghan Minister of aviation by a mob perhaps encouraged by members of the interim administration of Afghanistan shows that Afghan society remains deeply divided cracks 
The first reforms of the Afghan army will only accentuate its divisions.
The minister of defence of the temporary administration of Hamid Karzai in Kabul has already appointed the senior officers of this new army.
The minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is one of Tajikistan Panjshir district in the North, which is now three months earlier the leader of the forces of the Northern Alliance that has captured Kabul after the bombers Americans they have cleared the way.
As a group , his use is a direct challenge to the goal of reunification use the country of Mr . Karzai . 
Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the largest group being the Pashtuns, who represent two fifths of the total population.
The Hazars and Tajikis make up a respectable fifth of the population . 
Of the 38 officers elevated to the of general by Mr . Fahim , 37 are Tajiks , the thirty is an Uzbek . 
If, on the 15 to 17 million Pashtuns in the country, some are recruited as soldiers, they will serve under a command structure almost entirely composed of Tajiks.
The language of the Pashtuns is , however , different from Tajik as much as Spanish is from English , and millions of Pashtuns reach the age of military service with at best only a few notions of Tajik . 
The geographical profile of the new military authority is also its ethnic composition .
35 of the 38 senior officers are from a small area north of Kabul , that includes the province of Parwan where Bagram airport is and the Panjshir Valley , along bastion Northern Alliance's . 
In other words , the heads potential potential from 27 of the 29 provinces of heads potential excluded from the new military leadership in heads country potential 
Such a small group might overcome the impression that its members are a collection if they represented a broad cross section of the dozen political parties in the . 
But this is not the case.
Eighteen of the 38 senior officers come from one party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by Mullah and former professor of theology Burhanuddin Rabbani.
This was the party that gouverna Kabul briefly in the mid 1990s , creating the gouverna and chaos that led most of the Afghans gouverna welcome the arrival of the Taliban . 
The Communists practically equalled the number of members of the Jamiat in the military hierarchy.
Sixteen of the thirty-eight officers have long aligned to this party whose tricks in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two and half million lives in Afghanistan.
Most Afghans now see the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that the Czechs and Poles had for the National Socialists of Hitler.
It is true that some Afghans, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for different reasons and that they were in no way all hardened ideologues.
But in the case of the generals of general Fahim, six were professional workers of the Communist Party and have continued to serve the party after the invasion of the Red Army.
These six men , plus three communists who served as officers in the Afghan army , communists actively collaborated during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , communists lasted a decade . 
Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of the French officers corps of the post World War II era had been on the side of the Wehrmacht it was occupying their country .
In Afghanistan , travel quickly by of mouth . 
The Nationalists Afghans i . e . , almost all Afghans will discover soon the political reasons for members of the innermost circle of General Fahim , if not already done . 
Even this overwhelming evidence of bias and prejudice in the formation of the high command of the new army could be outvoted if the generals included professionalism and commitment to patriotic values of real national armed forces in their task.
Unfortunately, only 10 of the 38 officers promoted by Fahim were trained as professional military officers.
An eleventh served as a pilot.
By contrast, 24 on the general 38 (the training of the remaining four generals are still unknown) are civilians, who had a profession, which come from the offices of the Communist Party, or in a case, which have been Mullah.
What do all of these statistics mean in terms of everyday reality?
They mean that when the heads of international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan , as well as official military and diplomatic American meet with the Afghan defence , they will meet with Abdul Rashid Dostum , a and a notoriously brutal and corrupt , who remains in contact with old friends of the Red Army still on in Moscow . 
This means that the head of the armed forces in Afghanistan as well as the head of operations and the head of Army intelligence are also communists , men whose loyalty remains uncertain and whom many Afghans mistrust . 
Is this team likely to unite an Afghanistan torn apart by ? 
Is the presence team in Kabul able to instill confidence in the three team of the Afghan population who are excluded from the team high command ? 
Or this list constitutes rather the harvest of an approach all for the winner of the government that is required at some point in the future to unleash another bloody national reaction by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled on ? 
The UN and European and American politicians must ponder these questions before agreeing to a thoroughgoing takeover by a small unpopular minority .

Celebration of the irrational
cheers for the new of Nobel Prize laureates Economics Daniel Kahneman of Princeton cheers and Vernon Smith of laureates Mason University in Virginia cheers 
As many Nobel Prizes , these rewards not only recognise the key work undertaken by M . M . Kahneman and Smith , but also the schools of that they have helped to develop . 
Mr Kahneman , a psychologist , has shown that individuals consistently behave in a less conventional than what traditional economists believe . 
His work shows not only that people sometimes act differently from standard economic theoretical predictions , but also that they do it regularly , systematically and in a manner which can be understood and interpreted through different assumptions that compete with those used by mainstream economists . 
For most market participants, and observers, it seems not to make much difference.
The traders on Wall Street that traffic with actions that they know to be bad exploit the irrational that mm. Kahneman and Smith have shown.
A large part of the excitement that led to the swelling of the markets was based on the exploitation of the psychology of investors.
In fact, this irrationality is not new to economists, either.
John Maynard Keynes décrivit once the stock market as not being based on décrivit fight of rational individuals to discover the foundations of décrivit , but rather as a beauty contest in which décrivit winner spot the onewho best what the décrivit will say . 
The Nobel Prize this year celebrates the criticism of a simplistic market economy , just like last year's that I received with two other members 
Last year's winners were focusing on the fact that the market players have different information and , and that this asymmetry of information has a marked impact on the functioning of the economy . 
Specifically , last year's winners implied that markets are not effective ; that governments have a great role to play . 
The invisible hand of Adam Smith , the idea that free trade leads to the effectiveness as guided by an invisible hand , in part because it does not exist . 
This, too, is not new for those who work every day with the markets (and make a fortune by taking advantage of this information asymmetry and exceed).
For more than 20 years ago, economists were passionate about these so-called ‘ rational ’ forecast models who assumed that all players have the same information (albeit imperfect) and are perfectly rational, that markets are perfectly efficient, that there has never unemployment (except when it is caused by the unions eager or minimum wages imposed by the governments), and that there has never any rationing of funding.
Such models are predominant , particularly in postgraduate courses in the United States , despite evidence to the contrary that demonstrate the triumph of ideology over science . 
Unfortunately , students of programmes higher education are now the decision makers in programmes countries and they are trying to implement based programmes these ideas , that are today known as the programmes fundamentalism . 
Let me be clear here the rational expectations models have contributed significantly to economic theory ; rigour that their supporters have impressed on economic thinking has helped to highlight the weakness of its many underlying assumptions . 
Any good scientific thought is able to recognise it's limits, but the prophets of rational expectations generally have shown little modesty.
Vernon Smith is one of the leaders of the development of experimental economy , the idea that you can test many economic proposals in a laboratory . 
One of the reasons the economy is a complex , which also explains many disagreements among economists , is that economists cannot conduct controlled . 
Nature throws off balance the full scale experiences , in most circumstances , so many things can change so quickly that it is often difficult to disentangle the causes from the consequences .
In principle , a laboratory can conduct controlled experiments , and generate more reliable inferences .
Critics of the experimental economy worry that the subjects apply to experimental contexts , ways of thinking that are determined outside of the experience , and that the experiences and inférences are not as detached and clear that in the physical sciences . 
However , the economic experience provide some knowledge on an important number of issues , such as design improved of auctions . 
Above all, irrationality of market participants, the main issue of the work of Mr Kahneman, has been repeatedly verified in the context of laboratories.
One of the most fun raised by experimental economy is the of from selfishness fun 
It seems at least in experimental situations that the experimental subjects are not selfish economists believe , with the exception of one group the economists themselves .
Even as the economy is a discipline that attracts people who are inherently selfish or because the economy is shaping the individuals to make them more selfish?
The answer, certainly, is sure to contain a little of both.
There is no doubt that experimental research and future work will help resolve this issue of the relative importance of these hypotheses.
The Nobel prize demonstrates how important it is to study the individuals and economies such as they are and not as we want to see them.
It is only by understanding real human behavior that we can hope to develop policies that will also allow us to better work our economies .

Bush and his bad faith faith policy 
An episode of the most surreal quality happened this year during the World Economic Forum in Davos . Experts from the oil industry have explained that the melting of polar cap far faster than all of the earlier forecasts is in fact not actually a problem , but also fact an opportunity , huge new quantities of oil will now be accessible .
Similarly , these experts have acknowledged that the refusal of the United States to sign the Law of the Sea , the international convention which determines access to sources of offshore oil and other resources , poses a risk of international conflict . 
However, they also stressed the benefits: the oil industry, in its relentless pursuit of new reserves, has no need to beg Congress to get the right to plunder Alaska.
President George W. Bush has a strange ability of not understanding  important messages.
For years, it has become increasingly clear that its energy policy is wrong.
Some members of his party refer to a former energy bill drafted by the oil industry, as being very beneficial for all the lobbyists.
In praising to the the virtues of the market economy , Bush's only goal consists of giving enormous subsidies to the oil industry , despite the increasing deficits the country is facing . 
But the market is not working properly when it is a matter of energy. The government should be totally opposed to what the Bush administration has proposed.
The fact that Americans do not pay the price of pollution and especially that of their huge production of greenhouse gases resulting from their energy waste leads to a devaluation of energy prices and consequently , excessive drinking . 
The government should encourage energy savings . Its speech on setting prices , primarily through energy tax speech is an effective method to do so . 
But instead of favoring saving energy, Bush insisted on a policy of "first draining America" of its own resources, making it in the future even more dependent on external oil resources.
It doesn't matter whether strong demand is raising oil prices and creating a windfall for many Middle East countries, which are not the best friends of America.
Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, it seems that Bush has finally taken the measure of the growing energy dependency of America. It had become difficult for him not to see the consequences of the rapidly rising oil prices.
But , once again , the gestures of its government will only worsen the problems in gestures immediate future . 
Bush is still refusing to act in favour of energy savings and spending very little money to favour his continued prayer of salvation . 
What to make , then , of the recent declaration of Bush on his commitment to reduce , within 25 years , American oil dependency in the middle east by 75 ? 
For investors , the message is clear Don't invest anymore in the new reserves in the Middle East , which are by far the cheapest oil in resources world . 
However , if there is no new investment in the Middle East reserves , the unbridled growth in energy consumption in the USA , China and elsewhere means that demand outstrips supply . 
And on top of it all , Bush's threats of sanctions against Iran could lead to a in the supply of one of the largest producers in the world . 
With a global oil production almost at its peak and prices that have almost doubled since the war in Iraq, this heralds prices even higher and more profits for the oil industry, the only real winner of the policy of Bush's Middle East.
However, nobody should blame Bush for having acknowledged that there is a problem.
But, as always, his proposals are nothing more than a small trick of his administration.
Besides his refusal to admit global warming, to encourage energy savings or to allocate sufficient funds to further research, Bush's great promise to reduce America's dependence on Middle East oil does not mean much.
With only 20% of America's oil extracted in the Middle East, Bush's aim could simply be achieved by increasing modestly supplies from other parts of the world.
The Bush administration must absolutely realise that oil from the global market . 
Even if America were completely independent of oil from the Middle East, the reduction of energy production in this region could have devastating effects on world prices and even more so on the American economy.
As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no clear explanation of the official policy.
Bush is playing with the policy with the feeling anti-arabe and anti-iranien Americans?
Or is it yet another example of incompetence and confusion?
According to what we saw these past five years, the right answer is certainly more than a bit of bad faith and pure foolishness.

The road map of China
China is poised to adopt his 11th five-year plan, setting the stage to extend what is arguably the most remarkable economic transformation in history, while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world's population.
Never before has the world known such sustained ; never before had there been such a reduction in poverty . 
The explanation of the long term success of China lies part in its unique of pragmatism and vision . 
While much of the rest of the developing world, according to the Washington consensus, is engaged in a quest to increase GDP worthy of Don Quixote, China has once again made clear that it sought sustainable and more equitable increases of the real living standards.
China is aware that it has entered a phase of economic growth imposing huge demands on the environment that cannot last.
we change course , living standards will eventually be compromised .
It is for this that the new five year plan great on the environment . 
Many parts of China among the most backward grew so fast that would be a if other parts of the country were growing even growth . 
While this phenomenon has reduced poverty , inequality has risen , with growing disparities between urban and rural areas , and between coast and inland interior . 
The report this year of the World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, and not only poverty, should raise concerns, but the 11th five-year plan of China frontalement tackles the problem.
The government calls for a more harmonious society over several years , and the plan describes ambitious plans for achieving this purpose . 
China also recognizes that what separates the least developed countries from the most developed countries is not only a difference of resources but also of knowledge.
So it established bold plans to reduce these disparities and created a basis for independent innovation.
China's role in the world and in the world economy has changed, and the plan also reflects the situation.
Its future growth will be based more on domestic demand than on exports, which means an increase in consumption.
Indeed , China suffers from an unusual excessive savings . 
The people save in part due to weakness in social government insurance programs: strengthen Social Security (pension), public health and education will reduce the social inequality, will increase the sense of well-being of citizens and household goods.
If it did and , until now , China has almost always outstripped even its own high expectations these adjustments may impose enormous pressure on a global economic system already destabilized by the United States' enormous fiscal and commercial imbalances . 
If China starts to save less , as announced by its representatives , and goes on with a more diversified investment of its reserves , who is going to finance the trade deficit of more than 2 billion a day of the United States ? 
This is an issue to address another day, but this day is perhaps not so distant.
With such a clear understanding of the future , the challenge will be in the understanding . 
China is a big country , which could not have succeed so well without extensive devolution . 
But the decentralization poses its own problems.
Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.
While America claims that it can not resources to do anything about it , the most senior Chinese resources have acted more responsively . 
Within a month after the adoption of the plan, new ecological taxes on cars, petrol and timber products have been imposed: China is using market mechanisms to resolve its environmental problems and those of the world.
But the pressure on leaders of local governments to create economic growth pressure jobs will be enormous . 
They will be very tempted to say that if America is not capable of producing way to protect our planet, how they could?
To translate this vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, including significant increases in taxes on the environment.
While China has been transformed into a market economy, it saw develop some problems that are the scourge of developed countries: special interests obscuring the personal interests under a mask of ideology.
Some will mention the trickle-down effect: do not worry about the poor, everyone will benefit from growth.
And opposed the policies of competition and the strict laws of corporate governance Let Darwinism operate its wonders . 
Arguments for growth will be promulgated to counter strong social and environmental policy for example , increase increasing taxes on petrol would kill our car industry . 
Such so called pro growth policies do not only fail to provide growth , they threaten the entire vision of China's future .
There is only one way to avoid it: the open discussion of economic policies in order to unveil sophistry and to provide the means to implement creative solutions for the many challenges China faces today.
George W . Bush has shown how dangerous it is to abuse secrecy and restrict the decision making process to a close circle of . 
Most people outside China do not realise how its leaders , , have been engaged extensive deliberations and consultations even with foreigners when they struggled to solve the problem with which they were faced .
The market economies are not self regulated . 
They can not simply be left on pilot , especially if one wants to ensure that their profits are widely shared . 
But dealing with a market economy is not easy.
It is a balancing act, which must constantly respond to economic changes.
The 11th five-year plan of China provides a road map in this direction.
The world opens its , full of hope and of fear , while the lives of 1 . 3 billion people continue to be transformed .

The lessons on democracy by Tocqueville
fact of the war in Iraq , 200 years after fact birth of Tocqueville , the world debating the fact of democracy . 
Tocqueville is rightly famous for having rejected the nostalgia reactionary, given that democracy is our destiny, warning, however, on the dangers it presents for freedom.
Should we share his concern?
Tocqueville did not consider democracy first as a political system, but primarily as an intellectual property that shapes the customs and traditions of society, awarding him a sociological and psychological dimension.
Tocqueville believed that democratic regimes guide the course of our thoughts , our desires regimes our passions . 
And there has been the renaissance man and the twentieth century Homo Sovieticus, "the rights of democracy" is a form of human beings.
For Tocqueville , the systemic effects of democracy can lead people to abandon their ability to reasoning . 
They can only pretend to judge the events and the values by themselves , when in fact they simply repeat the réductrices of the majority . 
What Tocqueville called the stranglehold of the "social power" on the opinion is probably stronger in democratic systems - a view that made the level of demagoguery and manipulation by the media in the modern world.
Tocqueville believed that over the long term, nothing can really object to this trend.
Neither local democracy , nor small groups within company nor the checks , nor civil rights can prevent company decline of critical thinking that democracy seems to engender . 
The school is at best an away from the irresistible influence that society exerts on the mind . 
, Tocqueville believed that a religious faith or the search for virtue in the ancient manner could sometimes elevate the soul , but that both were incompatible with the democratic ideal when imposed by the authorities within the framework of public life .
The theorists néo-marxistes school in Frankfurt and Hannah Arendt who feared above all the disappearance of reason in modern societies are the heirs to the thought of Tocqueville.
It can also be noted that the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet has called one of these recent books democracy against itself.
For these authors, the democratic way of life tends to eliminate any original thinking and prevent the emergence of a culture of good level, yielding to a mediocrity that leave people vulnerable to the enemies of democracy.
If history is replete with criminal regimes supported by the masses intimidated and manipulated, the greater risk of democratic countries is to see their citizens in the indifference and focus on short-term thinking, in search of their immediate interest.
The past despite rituals aimed at the commemoration of historical events is masked by dependence on the present moment and the hype . 
Even the supposedly educated ruling class is a victim of this grip.
The main problem with the democratic democracy lies in its lack of historical awareness . 
As proclaimed Tocqueville, are the shortcomings of democracy make resigned pessimism  the only realistic path – but unacceptable - which is open to us?
I don't think so.
There are ways to combat what might be called the Democratic stupidity that spread spreading today . 
The first of these resources to develop an education system which form of real critical criticism , particularly through the matters largely neglected today like resources , history and philosophy . 
If you want to educate citizens informed and able to think for themselves, which is essential to the functioning of democracy, our schools need to stop running after the latest forms and begin to develop the skills of analysis of pupils.
Because of their tendency to cultivate and distraction , the mass media are the main obstacle to such an education . 
Today , many people spend more time during their lives in of a television than in a classroom . 
The passivity induced by mass media is the exact of the active engagement of citizens that is necessary for democracy . 
But it is hard to imagine that the mass media other than quality newspapers would , of their own volition , become a tools of enhancing education critical . 
This focus on the mass media does not come from an elitist disregard for popular culture.
It is not just a matter of popularity Mozart was popular in his time Shakespeare's plays attracted the poor as much the rich but of the refusal of mass culture to challenge provoke .
The result is indifference and widespread public . 
For a long time , a global media culture is growing increasingly unable to generate any or to improve feelings . 
fact of its lack of interest in these matters , it is fact culture that threatens democratic freedoms , because it doesn't create in fact way a sense of duty to society , history fact the community . 
Is it too late to defend against a culture that blunts the to that minds ? 
Tocqueville scorned the elites of his time because of their complacency about the dangers of democracy of the droves . 
Will the short sightedness of our leaders help achieve the of his alarming prediction ?

A Europe for all
Long members of the European Union seem to doubt the future of the European Union , but the Ukrainians are looking at the European Union with certain hope and admiration . 
The fundamental objective of our foreign policy is to integrate European progress , because Ukraine has discovered that autonomy is not an end in itself , but merely a beginning . 
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when a nation is a victim of ostracism, no nation is free.
We are , in Europe , all linked by a link which we cannot escape , connected by a single destiny . 
All the aspects of the culture we share, without mentioning the century of suffering that we have just shared, confirm this.
Everything that affects a European directly affects us all indirectly . 
We can never afford to live with the notions of two Europes, one of haves and have-nots, one of elected and banned.
Anyone living on the European continent today cannot, in fact must not, be regarded as a foreigner in his Union.
The great Pax Europa of today, as as well as the current pan-European prosperity depends on it.
Some would say, of course, that Ukraine is not part of Europe.
They come in Kiev and its inhabitants, young and old workers, the wives of farmers, lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood up and remained standing in the cold and snow for weeks now to defend their liberties last winter.
Are they not united with those who gathered around General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Do they not make body with those who died in battle for the defence body the Spanish Republic in the 1930s , those who body Budapest in 1956 and put an end to fascism body Spain and Portugal in the 1970s ? 
Are they not motivated by the same spirit as Poland's Solidarity solidarnösc the peaceful masses that started the Velvet Revolution in Prague solidarnösc 1989 ? 
This is the true soul of Europe and no doubt can destroy it.
For all those who consider that Ukraine is too far behind to become a member of the Union, I say this: They should visit my country and see the mothers who stay until late in the office to teach their children how to use the computer in their office.
Let them come to language in every village and town where young youth getting ready for Europe by learning French , German and English . 
Those who doubt Ukraine's European vocation should understand that Europe is not a simple question of equipment and motorway: it is the craving for freedom, prosperity and solidarity.
I believe that our future is also promising that Europe's past is proud , and that our destiny is not a land border forgotten in a troubled region but an influential part of peace and unity of Europe . 
Self determination is no longer synonymous with insulation because sharing in the national independence of our days simply insulation return to the world stage with a new status . 
The new nations can build the same kind of successful with their former occupants as France has established with Germany a relationship based on equality and mutual interests . 
This is the type of relationship that my government wants to establish with Russia, so we can help extend the area of peace in Europe.
It is premature, of course, to go beyond the indication of the utmost importance we attach to the possibility of entering the European Union.
We know that our role in this great structure will not come about in one night.
We know that the great works of European unity is not confined to the documents and statements but are rooted in the innovative designed to improve living standards and provide security to all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine to join the European Union will not be easy, fast, or without effort.
But the European Union itself , it will be built and it will happen .
We know that the challenge is great , but worth the trouble , and Europe must understand that this is our goal . 
The renovation of Ukraine depends in part battle innovative to end a century long nightmare in battle fascism and communism , ideologies born at the heart battle Europe , fought for power . 
Throughout cities in Ukraine , a few months ago , parents and children confronted armed troops , snarling dogs and even death .
Just a few years ago a young journalist , Georgi Gongadze , seeking to inform the public about the corruption of our former regime , was assaulted and beheaded by the henchmen of the regime . 
Our Orange Revolution, last winter, has proved that Ukraine and its people can win.
And, despite the doubts and difficulties, I still have an unfailing confidence in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of the history of Ukraine.
I refuse to accept the idea that Ukraine is so tragically condemned to live at the heart of the night without stars from the Communist legacy to the point of never being able to day peace and a real European unity . 
When the European Union citizens look at Ukraine's place in Europe, they will have to look closely and beyond the face that we will show them.
See above the devastated areas that has caused communism , beyond the poverty and social divisions through which our former leaders today répudiés sought to extend their grip . 
They must gaze close up on the face of our president , Viktor Yushchenko , ravaged by the poison he was administered in the election campaign last year , and remember the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux , for whom the most beautiful faces are those of the wounded .

The Muslim Civil War 
Is the gap between Sunnis and Shiites in the Middle East far deeper than the current conflict between Israel and the Arabs?
One might think so given the reaction of some Arab governments to decisions to Israel . 
While Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Tyre , Saudi Arabia , perhaps the Arab Muslim state's most conservative of all , openly condemned the actions of Hezbollah who initiated the against Israel . 
Never in the history of Arab Israeli conflict has a country that considers itself the leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly .
In addition , Saudi Arabia's from Hezbollah is not a unique . 
Egypt and Jordan have roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader , Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , for their adventurism .
What's behind this stunning situation 
Are we undergoing a fundamental point in relations between Arab nationalism and bigotry point 
Does the Sunni government of Saudi Arabia's fear and anxiety over Shiite Islam push it to be more involved in the Arab unity and the Palestinian cause ? 
The complaints of Hezbollah by Arabs suggest that the Muslim complaints , already evident in the daily violence in complaints , is growing and intensifying across the Middle East complaints 
The will of President George W . Bush destroy societies frozen in the Arab world was sentenced to draw up the forces of modernisation against the elements of traditional Islamic and Arabic societies . 
It seems to have released the most atavistic forces in the region .
The opening of this Pandora's box have given birth to an time box more terrible violence , which can be described without a as box Muslim civil war . 
The Shiite Sunni gap has existed since the dawn of the history of Islam , but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non Arab Shiite Iran , as well as the dominance of their Shiite minorities by Sunni Arab countries , has generally left this rivalry in the background . 
Those tensions have further receded during the wave of Islamisation created by the Iranian revolution , because in its wake the sectarian Sunni identity of the Arabs has been further put back in the background as a broader 'Islamic' assertion appeared . 
That all changed when Al Qaeda , a Sunni terrorist group that draws heavily on the ideology staff wahabbites Wahabbi , launched its attacks against America in September 2001 . 
A special branch of Sunni militant Islam was underway.
When the United States launched wars against both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and Iraq's Sunni regime , this enboldened radical Sunnis . 
Sunni Arabs in the region , who have now gained confidence , see Israel and the West a single threat , the other one comprising the so called Shia crescent the arc of land that stretches from Lebanon to Iran through Syria and Iraq , populated by the supposed Shia heretics .
The leaders of Saudi Arabia , as guardians of sacred sites of the Muslim faith such as guardians and Medina , feel this threat perhaps most acutely guardians 
To Sunnis, Shiites are not confined to dominate the oil-rich regions of Iran, Iraq and the regions of the East of Saudi Arabia, they are also trying, by the actions of Hezbollah, to usurpate the role of 'protector "the dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.
It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and casts doubt on the loyalty of its Shiite population that the kingdom is moving away from Hezbollah.
The irony of the thing is that America , protective for a long of Saudi Arabia , made the responsibility of Shia in toppling Saddam Hussein and giving the Shiite parties the power in Iraq . 
The Bush administration seems to recognize what it had done , as the Shiite arc amounts in the east of the Arab Muslim world , the United States is trying to strengthen its protection of the Sunni arc Egypt , Jordan and Saudi Arabia in the west of the region . 
Israel , once an implacable enemy of the Arab cause , now seems to be inside this defensive defensive . 
But such a defensive position is necessarily unstable , simply of the pan Arab sentiments .
Today , ordinary Saudi citizens are hooked on Al Jazeera and other Arab TV networks via satellite to follow events in Gaza and southern Lebanon . 
They see Arab not Shiite , and Hezbollah alone responding . 
For them, Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance.
This is causing État Saudi to widen the Sunni Shiite État . 
After the official denunciation of Hezbollah by the kingdom , the Saudi state asked its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah heretical and deviant Shiites .
Such sentences can only exacerbate sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the surrounding region.
Faced with the worsening of these antagonism , will Sunni Muslim regimes end up believing antagonism they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their antagonism ? 
If they reach that conclusion, they will not need to look far away, because the fighters of this kind have already completed a training - given by Al Qaeda.

Why Europe can no longer ignore Georgia
The time when Europe could rely on America to make war time restore peace and democracy in its own court is time . 
Consequent with the European Union enlargement and, as demonstrated by the recent Russian gas crisis, the court now includes not only Ukraine but also Georgia.
Indeed, in Georgia, as in Ukraine, democracy is tested and Europe cannot afford to ignore it.
Georgia was the first country in the post Soviet space to put into its Revolution of Colour and by this to space , with dignity and maturity , the choice of space people in favour of democracy and European values . 
The flags of the European Union that fly over all Georgian public buildings since then show the natural , as old as the history of this country which , for the ancient Greeks , was an integral part of the world of the time . 
Prometheus , médée , the Amazons amazones and in neighbouring Armenia , Noah's médée , are amazones signs that the Europe of our myths starts here médée 
Through its history , its culture , its traditions , but also its more recent , culture was different from other republics of the former USSR culture for its criticism , independent , and even rebellious maverick culture Georgia is probably today area transplant democracy democratic is strongest culture 
So it is even more worrying to see threatened the democratization of the threat . 
Everything seemed to have started well enough.
of the launch without striking a blow of a policy of reforms , privatization , of fight against corruption , the research of new and therefore free of appeasing the previous regime , the implementation of a foreign policy marked by return to Europe in the game in Georgia .
The totalitarian mindset has resurfaced in these leaders who, proclaiming themselves the representatives of the majority, have been grabbing ever more powers.
This is a caste which the Hydra to thousand is dying and rise from the Ashes.
They and their methods of power that the "rose revolution" in November 2003 wanted all at once expunged were reintroduced into the heart of power, using their networks, with contacts including outside the boundaries, the enormous financial burden, their ability to intrigue and manipulation of the political and electoral appliances.
This is a power that does not sufficiently respect the essence of democracy which is not in the polls but in the division and balance of . 
Every day, the government interferes in the legislature, the vast majority of laws are written by the presidential chancellery; the parliament wants to control the daily exercise of government policy, including, in my case, the appointment of ambassadors and their day-to-day operation.
Finally, and this is the most serious, the judiciary have still not managed to break away from the guardianship of the executive and is more or not yet for the citizen or the investor the guarantor and protector, without which it is not to État of law and economic freedom.
This is a society to be democratic in his head, is not yet in his legs. It is still reluctant to engage in politics, leaving the scene to those who care for too long.
Because this democracy is in danger of collapsing , but because it is still there , strongly implanted in the population , in the society organisations , in a press that is searching for itself without losing its faculty for criticism . . . 
It is time for Europe to save democracy in order not to destroy all its hopes.
The United States has already done what it can , since independence , and they are right beside the stability of Georgia . 
The stability was certainly not identified with the democracy under Édouard Shevardnadze , Former Soviet foreign minister whom the Rose Édouard had resigned from his post of Georgian President . 
But the Americans have invested very generously in the survival of Georgian elites and their learning of democracy.
The of the Soros initiatives today now in way , seems to me to be most injustified the today revolution way not created from scratch by the today , way the propaganda of the Russian nationalists today accustomed to way intervention to be able think differently , but today democratic democracy way enabled it has certainly been fed today encouraged and way by aid of the Soros today . 
The course Georgia must take is to withdraw this time for good its evil totalitarian , that is a step that would require another kind of support that Europeans are not as likely to provide .
The models that must be proposed for the balance of power, the institutions of État of law, the operation of the judiciary or local democracy must be guided forms of Europe closer to reality in Georgia that the Anglo-Saxon model variant.
If Europe today rejected this task , it will be betraying his fundamental duty this country , small , Mediterranean , flexible , of long tradition , where democracy has much better chances of success than in Ukraine , which is both great and always very Soviet in his mind , without referring to Central Asia . 
Not to help Georgia is to accept that democracy and stability are so long to come not only in Tbilisi, but even more in Kiev, Minsk, to say nothing of Moscow.
It is above all taking a very serious risk.
Moscow, with ups and downs, endless dithering, an internal systems, began to resign itself to the idea of the inevitability of democracy, at least around it, not without having to abandon its imperial dreams and their instruments of power could suddenly revise its perception.
This hesitant resignation , this acceptance of normality in its relations with its neighbours , which was in its infancy , can be washed away by a sudden , irrational irrationality of Russian power of the infamous derjava which is unable to resist the lure of weakness , the feeling of , the temptation again to not be equal , but the strongest . 
This explains the recent Russian gas crisis.
Any sign of decline , of the weakened democratic tide will decline taken by Moscow as a vain hope sense decline reversibility Russia gradually became accustomed accoutumait not believing it . 
It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that it is wrong to place its hope in a return to past.
Europe has the responsibility for itself, for its future energy independence. It also has the responsibility of demonstrating that there are also strong European values -- freedom, democracy, justice between peoples.
For that Europe must provide the tools of his policy: a large public private foundation for Europe and democracy, a university to train the executives of tomorrow of democracies that seek again, a police, an army of judges and magistrates who live models close to the companies we want to convert.
Europe especially needs conviction.
If Europe does not itself agreed that it is the fate of its neighbours, democracy and the future of its values and spread, who believe in it tomorrow?

Berlusconi beleaguered
Silvio Berlusconi , who will become president of the European Union on 1st July , is a wise man who once loved to take risks whose commercial bets prove profitable . In the 1960s , he was the first to see that Milan , then a traditional Italian city where people walk to work , would become a modern metropolis , surrounded by American style suburbs .
Then he built his fortune in the real property . 
Fifteen years later, Mr. Berlusconi realized that the monopoly held by the Italian state television would not survive and he set up what will become the first private media group in Italy.
But he would not have achieved in or in real estate , if he had not had the appropriate political . 
In both cases , Berlusconi prevailed over competitors , advantage with the Socialists , then the competitors stars of Italian politics . 
His long association with Bettino Craxi , the most influential politician in Milan in the 1970s and prime minister of Italy during part of the 1980s , day early on . 
On the other However , political connections are not enough to become a politician .
Indeed, trade policy was certainly not part of the wishes of Berlusconi.
His media group , weakened by excessive diversification the decision to enter the detail distribution virtually destroyed it , encountered problems in the 1990s . 
Almost simultaneously, former Premier Craxi runs away in Tunisia, pursued by the Italian courts in the context of an investigation of corruption mani pulite conducted in the vast network known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).
The brain and exile of Craxi caused Berlusconi a sense of brain by depriving him of the solid policy support brain needed . 
He decided to become his own political sponsor .
As has often been the case in Italy's history, Berlusconi's decision to form a new political party (Forza Italia) a few months before the elections of 1994 paid off.
Silvio Berlusconi's lack of political experience policy in the fall of his first government six months policy . 
Any other rights as rich as Berlusconi would probably have given up . 
But he persista and presided over the opposition for six years ago persista 
In 2001 , his determination was rewarded with a resounding victory and , most important , an apparent to focus on . 
Once again , Berlusconi probably had no choice in the late 1990s , his association with disgraced Socialists disgrace both politically and legally . 
His only hope was to push bench control the Parliament and to introduce new bench to stop the number of corruption trials that bench guettait , a strategy that allows him to escape bench until his term to take . 
Unfortunately , while Berlusconi's government is invariably never short of speech , the legal provision put in place to suspend his trials are among the few laws that were passed during his two years in power . 
The achievements of Berlusconi in government combine good idea for example , the attempt to reform pensions Italian idea 1994 and inadequate implementation mainly by lack of courage idea as surprising as this appears to be . 
In 1994, during his first term, he realized early on that Italy should overhaul its pension system and introduced courageous legislation.
But one general strike proved enough to undermine his reformist zeal.
Recently, he has bravely sided with the United States in the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and his own political coalition.
But he soon afterward frightened by his own courage and became an almost invisible ally .
Despite his rhetoric , Berlusconi didn't attend assista was not invited to the summit with President Bush assista the Azores , in which the final decision assista go to war was taken . 
regards social reform , he fought the unions , but not delivering the good fight The infamous Article 18 of Italy , which allows courts to reinstate an employee working in his job if a judge finds he was fired unfairly .
But while article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.
It only served to provoke a confrontation with the unions and to distract the government from far more important social reforms.
Contrary to what happened in 1994 , Berlusconi's current government is still standing , but those who expected a revolution in of the free market will be disappointed . 
No significant tax cut was passed and the reform on pensions is still waiting.
Berlusconi's powerful Finance Minister , Giulio Tremonti , speaks often talk naively about the need to renew government intervention into the economy ; no action is undertaken to prevent strikes in the public transport sector . 
The moderate right wing voters , who wanted an Italian version i . e . , a somewhat diluted version of the Reagan Thatcher era , are disillusioned . 
Berlusconi is trying to mask his inactivity frightening its voters, by repeating again and again that the election of the moderate left would be tantamount to signing a pact with the devil (i.e., the communists).
The Italians seem more intelligent , as was clearly demonstrated by the result of the administrative elections in June . 
Why the courageous vision of the 1960s and 1970s it has lost its lustre?
This is partly due to the fact that we are no longer in this context; Berlusconi is 40 years old and during the past ten years he has lived in the world of Roman politics.
It has learned the art of political (and personal) survival, but he has lost his vision and his taste for risk.

Fill the technological gap américano European
In the second half of the 1990s, the average annual growth rate of productivity in Europe rose 0.7% while the United States posted a rate of 1.4%.
However , if we distinction between the industries that produce information and communication distinction ICT and those who simply use these technologies , distinction the gap in productivity growth appears to be almost entirely distinction to the weakness of the ICT European production . 
Annual productivity growth in sectors that use the ICT technology has averaged 0.63% in the US between 1995 and 2000 against 0.41% in Europe.
This situation confirms a well known fact Europe is less effective than the US at conducting research leading to innovations , either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research , because the available resources are used in a less effective way , both .
It is certain that the total spending on research and development are lower in Europe than in the US, but not by much.
In the 1990s , the United States spent 2 . 8 of their GNP on research and development every , versus 2 . 3 for Germany , 2 in the UK , and 1 . 9 in France . 
European governments continue as usual to complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support research and development (a far-fetched, given the tiny expenditure on research in the European budgets big), and each time the European Commission allows, they are subsidising the innovative companies or those who, according to them, are most likely to invest in research and development.
France and Italy , for example , have demanded that the limits imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact on the budget deficits of Eurozone members exclude public spending allocated for research . 
The French government has decided to get out Alstom, a company which developed several high-tech products, including the TGV train, the French, before it is bankrupt.
But it is highly unlikely that these tactics will help develop the European high-tech sector.
Why?
the weakness in research is not , at least not primarily , a matter of funding .
The subsidies will not create efficient high-tech companies.
First let's with the question of research . 
Europe is lagging behind the U . S . in each area the number of patents , the number of Nobel , and the number of researchers in other countries it can attract . 
But the funding is only the noticeable tip of the problem . 
A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the US for this purpose, and this for two reasons: the motivations and the demand for technology.
We are afraid that additional spending not followed by a change of archaic scholars will only serve to produce more waste and not more discoveries . 
They would increase the power, prestige and resources of steadfast pressure groups composed of established university professors that often prevent access and competition in their university.
The request of technology also plays an important role . 
It allows us to focus the research, impose deadlines, sift through the results of research, and allows us to evaluate the patents according to market prices.
Without the reasons given by the beneficiaries of these research findings, research is likely to drift, often without clear direction.
We must recognise that this situation does not apply to all areas: the study of fragments of ancient Greek is precious, even if it rarely meets a demand.
But it is important in areas , both theoretical and practical , which could provide a basis for the production of new technologies physics , biology , chemistry , technical , etc . 
But it is defense spending which is the main driver the demand for research . 
Most of the technological advances in the post-war period (the micro-puces to the Internet until the new batteries for mobile phones developed for the US Army in Iraq) have had at least at the beginning, a military application.
Cell phones , tracking by satellite and high resolution cameras are expensive , but fortunately for industries that use them , their development costs have been partly borne by the government . 
A key reason for the superiority of the US in terms of research is explained by the size and composition of defence spending . 
The Pentagon budget is not only important: it represents more than half of all American Government spending on research and development; in France, defense spending is only a quarter of the total expenditure.
In 1999, the American spending on research and development related to the defence rose 0.45% of GDP, providing the UK and France have reached only half of this figure, with 0.26% and 0.22%, respectively.
As suggested by the Alstom case, the French have a different model in mind.
Instead of supporting research and development with the big defense budgets, they prefer to do so directly by subsidizing high-tech companies in France.
The official justification to the national defence being too low to create the demand needed to support defence and development in high tech sectors , while there defence still no European budget for . 
This is not a coincidence if it is awarded in a spirit of competition , such a supranational budget would designate winners and losers . 
But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech companies could not be up: they think it is preferable to preserve these companies with generous subsidies and to avoid the consolidation of the European defence budgets.
By integrating its defense expenditures increasing their importance , Europe would kill two birds with one stone .
It would be more credible when it needs to be heard at the tables of international negotiations, particularly about America, and it would boost scientific research.
To achieve this, it should not maintain larger deficits, which simply imply higher taxes, but reduce spending in other areas of the budget.
In other words: a sacrifice on the short term for a gain on the long term.

Debt the American . 
After nearly 15 years of unprecedented growth, with only a short downturn in 2000 / 2001 - the US is heavily indebted abroad,at nearly  25% of GDP.
With a current-account deficit which is now 5% of GDP, the external debt of the United States is growing quickly.
Yet no country can accumulate debt forever , and this situation must come therefore an end sooner or later . 
At the beginning of the year 1985, when the current-account deficit the US had reached $120 billion - equivalent to a third of the current deficit - the rest of the world stopped the fund.
The dollar was brutally devalued, 50% compared to the deutschmark.
Europe has no interest in renewing this experience.
In reality , the world does not have the resources for a sudden disappearance of the current account deficit of the United States . 
Without exports to the United States , the sluggish growth that Europe experienced during the past year would évanouirait . 
The process may have already begun: the value of the euro - between $1.20 and 1.30 dollars in recent months - was enough to freeze European growth for the end of this year.
Before the of the dollar , exports of the 25 EU member states have increased by 6 . 5 per year , against 2 for consumption and 3 for investment . 
In Japan, the recent recovery was almost totally pulled by exports.
But the yen value and growth there also seems to be suspended . 
While the world's central banks are full of dollars trade imbalances are worrying , there are three possible solutions .
First, an increase in government savings in the United States.
It is unlikely, at least in the near future, given President Bush's ambitious plans on tax matters and the continuation of war in Iraq.
American savings are also slightly negative, and an increase could lead to a slowdown in activity in the short term.
Secondly, a more pronounced devaluation of the dollar, well above its present value compared to the euro and yen.
A revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also be a good thing.
Thirdly , an resumption of growth in Europe , which would cause a resumption in exports from the United States . 
For that to happen, European companies would have to reduce their costs and increase their productivity.
As always in that , it promises a whole range of structural reforms , but none will probably be implemented soon . 
So, what to do?
One possibility would be to increase time without a proportional increase in hourly rate time 
In the early 1970s, we worked the same number of hours on both sides of the Atlantic.
Today , in France and in Germany , we work on average 50 less than in the United States . 
This is partly due to a higher European taxation , and on this level nothing is possible one cannot force a person to work they believe that their after tax earnings are not worth it .
But the relative decline of working time is also due to the success of unions, which have attained mandatory holidays.
A reform in this area, with longer working hours, would not reduce the total income of employees, but would reduce the costs of production.
This idea is beginning to be addressed in the press and , hopefully , behind the scenes among politicians and unions . 
Meanwhile , the of the world has an interest in the United States retaining an unprecedented current account deficit precedent at the price of 500 billion per year . 
This allows the Chinese to maintain the stability of their currency against the dollar, to remain extremely competitive, and to gradually shift 200 million workers from agriculture to industry, the aim of authorities for the next decade.
In Europe , the American deficit is the only source of growth . 
But this cannot continue.
One day or another , Europe will have to stop thinking that the United States can save its economy and start relying on its own resources . 
But it is no surprise if the United States and the devaluation of the dollar are blamed for the next downturn in the European economy.
A scapegoat is always helpful.

Abba Eban, Voice of Israel.
For nearly two generations , Abba Eban has represented the voice of Israel by acting as a messenger to the Conservatives and the powerful nations and the Jewish people worldwide . 
Since his first appearance alongside Dr . Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940s during the struggle for independence and Jewish sovereignty , only a very few people have expressed the Zionist Jewish so clearly and with such eloquence and conviction . 
With his Churchillian prose and his Shakespearean shakespeariennes locutions his melodious mélodieuses and his grandiloquent voice conveyed shakespeariennes locutions the message of hope from a people who shakespeariennes have lost locutions hope and faith in humanity after the horrors shakespeariennes locutions Second World War . 
As ambassador to the United States and the UN , then as Minister of Foreign Affairs , he represented Israel as a liberal with imagination the world could identify . 
The largest and most powerful nations enviaient a powerful spokesman , and his speeches became enviaient cases for men of state and diplomats from distant enviaient . 
His books , that he found time to write despite the hectic of diplomacy , were composed with a unique combination of colossal erudition clarity crystal ball . 
His background and donations for rhetoric each other background form a donations . 
Rarely has a small country been represented by man state of such magnitude only Thomas Masaryk and man Smuts can stand up to such a comparison . 
It was a true patriot, formerly of the term: proud of its people without being however, ethnocentric, rights of the world but deeply rooted in the Jewish cultural heritage, which focused on the plight and the tribulations of the Jewish people, but never lose sight of universal humanity.
In a word , He was a modern Jew in the best sense . 
It has often been claimed that the prime minister Levi Eshkol spoke seven languages, all in Yiddish.
You could say that Eban spoke ten of them , and all focus an Oxford Cambridge . 
However , which were on the outside world was not always an advantage at the heart of harsh and the collapse of Israeli politics . However , what pleased the outside world did not constitute an advantage to the and collapse of Israeli politics . 
Eban was doubtlessly too refined , too academic and rights much a world of the world to hoist himself up to rights of a greasy end as Disraeli mast rights plenty it . 
Accompanied by Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan , he was obliged to leave the government in 1974 after the Yom Kippur war . 
He could hardly be held responsible for the hubris that triggered the avalanche of 1973 , but these however led to his downfall .
He was never able to return to power and when he was facing the new policy of and populism , he felt shot because he could not cope with this new style . 
In the international arena , the pen of Eban took the place of the sword for him his speech was his lance .
He was less adroit with political battles in Israel . 
He could prove a hard fighter on the turf , but it is fairer to say however that he could have fought harder to defend his moderate and dovish convictions in the post 1967 government , in which he partipated . 
It is not clear whether he would have prevailed, given his lack of an independent political base, but his prestige and his reputation at the international level could have give him a chance if he had chosen to take up the gauntlet.
He never did it.
The silence of Eban over the of recent years wasn't only caused by his disillusionment with Israeli or policy his declining health . 
In a period public debates in Israel are torn between pseudo religious nationalist fanatists and anti Zionists who are posing as post modernists , the moral certainties of Eban , driven by good manners , can seem superficial .
But to build a country, it is essential to have a certain moral force, and Eban offered such a force in abundance to his people and the world.
Although it has passed several years since I spoke to Eban, I do not have doubted for one second of the fact that it would have been extremely sad to see how were the events after the failure of the Camp David talks and Taba in 2000-2001 and conduct adopted by the Israeli policy, it would seem a bad omen.
However, in all likelihood he would have been even more disappointed by the inability of the Palestinians to reach an agreement on the existence of the Jewish state.
As a pro-Arab by training, in the culture of Arab and Muslim culture, he has always hoped that the past Arab glorious could be become younger, a growing Arab and Muslim tolerance could triumph of fanaticism and extremism.
Such was the basis of his hope for reconciliation between Jews and Arabs.
That revival Arabic , to use the expression of the revival Palestinian academic George Antonius , has not seen the of revival could have been Eban's biggest disappointment . 
Despite the image of a man of the world that Eban gave , he was extremely vulnerable what some might regard sometimes traits pride could result from source humble origins . 
While expressing himself in very careful English , Eban was not born in a castle he came from a section of Anglo Jews . 
He was , in the truest sense , a self made , whose courage , ambition , dynamism and deep faith in his fate have led to the summit . 
His atmosphere were sailing in the high sphere . 
In this, Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he was so gloriously representing.

A Practical Handbook to the Israeli Hawks 
The announcement by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon stating his willingness to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and some West Bank settlements has shocked and surprised the Israeli nation and the nations of the world . 
Many have denounced Sharon's plan as a stratgème 
But this surprise was crazy since the beginning.
Despite the appearance that they give to foreigners , the debate in Israel on the future of the occupied territories have never been reduced to a simple story of hawks and doves . 
As anything else in Israel, the process is more complex, particularly where the hawks are concerned.
Overall, there are two species of Israeli hawks: the ideological and the strategic.
The ideological hawks view the occupied territories as part of the historic view Israel , the homeland of the Jewish people . 
For them , the territories represent a Jewish , which explains their insistence on calling the West Bank by its historical Hebrew name Judea and Samaria . 
The ideological hawks are not all religious , there are those who may base their claims on divine promises and prophecies .
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists and their jargon is similar to the Nationalist types of Eastern and Central Europe.
The former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to this category.
The ideological hawks generally belong to the National Religious Party and to Likud . 
They are inspired by an ideology associated with nationalist Vladimir Jabotinsky , who founded revisionist Zionism order challenge the more moderate version adopted by the founding Fathers of Israel , including Chaim Weizmann and David Ben Gurion . 
came the strategic hawks .
For them, given the form geographically close and vulnerable to Israel and the hatred of Arabs, control of the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but responds to safety concerns.
For them, the Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to the historical land, but are strongholds of security destined to prevent (or to push for a place more strategic) an attack on the heart of Israel.
This assessment of the situation may be right or wrong, but it is certainly not ideological.
Ariel Sharon, who has a military background (he grew up in a social environment where ideas resembled more those of the Labour Party than those of Jabotinsky), is a strategic falcon.
For the Hawks ideological, the compromise is a betrayal: how could jeopardise the historical heritage of the Jewish people, without mentioning the word of God of Abraham?
The strategic Hawks are however open to negotiation and practical compromises , if the circumstances are appropriate and if the safety concerns justify it in their eyes . 
It is in this context that the measures taken by Sharon must be considered .
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He got neither.
With the defeat and disappearance of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an 'eastern front "against Israel has weakened.
Without a Palestinian partner , and because of the Palestinian terrorism continued the actions of Israel's persistent , fail to quell the measures taken by Sharon this ideas for the strategy build an effective barrier , to shift some of the settlements and strategically unsustainable , and wait .
Sharon's statements during the previous year seem to follow a well defined model.
First , he admitted that sooner day later a Palestinian state would make its appearance , day idea unthinkable for the ideologically pure hawks . 
A few months later, he shocked his supporters at the Likud Party conference by declaring that the occupation was unacceptable and untenable, another shock for those who had always talked of "liberated" territories rather than "occupied territories."
Last December , he explicitly stated that Israel was facing a ceasefire fire that would inevitably lead to the resettlement of some settlements . 
Although these statements once again come to but simple verbiage , they still constitute a new language for like Prime Minister Likud . 
Sharon's latest statements however have explicitly named the settlements that need to be evacuated , the director of the National Security Council , General Giora Eiland , was appointed chairman of an interdepartemental rehousing committee responsible for making plans to evacuate the settlements and to provide compensation for the relocated settlers relogés 
All of this has radically altered the political map inside Israel.
Some of the ideoligical ideologies of Sharon's government have threatened to resign ; ideologies Peres has announced that the Labour party would give ideologies a parlementary safety member there is also mention of ideologies Labour Party joining a national unity government . 
The test is obviously not about planning , but the implementation of the withdrawal , the road is long bumpy .
Sharon's choice of time may have been guided by the problems he encounters following police inquiries about his alleged corruption . 
However , anyone who would want to predict the future of Sharon should remember that , opposed to Begin and Shamir , Sharon has a military history and that for him , security , not ideology , comes first .
His apparent pragmatism shouldn't therefore be surprising.

Iraq Victors' justice 
Saddam Hussein is dead, but not all Iraqis are rejoicing.
Instead, how different ethnic and religious groups have reacted to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty in maintaining the cohesion of Iraq.
For the Shiite majority, long violently suppressed by Saddam Hussein and with all previous Iraqi Sunni religious regimes, the death of Saddam symbolises their conquest of the political leadership.
Moreover , their expressions of triumphalist triumphalist are a cruel reminder of how the oppressed , triumphalist freed , can easily become oppressors themselves . 
For the Sunni minority, out of power by the American invasion and expresses his frustration by the daily attacks against the Shiite population and its holy places, Saddam remains a hero for long.
The Kurds -- as Shiites, have suffered the wrath of Saddam Hussein for decades -- discreetly cling to their independence, while making what is needed to ensure that they will never again be subject to an Arab regime.
The Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki , who represents the Shia and Kurdish coalition in power , has expressed his hope that the implementation of the dictator will allow the overcoming of sectarian divisions . 
But even if his words seem sincere , the reality leads in the opposite direction , the offensive verbal exchanges at the time of the execution will not help to forget that it was the justice of the winners not the United States but the Shiites .
These events do not bode well for the future of what we should get used to name"ex-Irak."
To À truth , the current debate in Washington on stabilizing À truth inappropriate because we cannot stabilize something which no À truth in this case precisely , Iraq as a État À truth 
Under the guise of constitutional amendments inspired by the United States, the Shiite majority has managed to capture almost absolute power.
It is and what appeared to be in Washington , a few months ago , a successful transition to a representative government is a farce as under Saddam , the authority depends on the arms control . The difference is that today the government no longer has the monopoly of violence . 
Each of the militia, each ministry, each Shiite political faction has its own weapons, its wholesale arm and death squads, while the Sunnis continue to use stockpiles of weapons accumulated under Saddam Hussein for fighting a rearguard action against the new order, apparently legitimized by the elections.
Except for a new violent dictatorship , no authority À able to bring Shiites , Sunnis , and Kurds into a À political entity . 
The dream of the U . S . democratized overnight a deeply divided society accustomed to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying of political demons . 
In these circumstances , the ensuing Debate about the Baker Hamilton Report in Washington has little bearing on the future of Iraq , although it remains essential to the future of power , prestige , and status of the United States in the world . 
Iraq's future will be decided by the Iraqis , but by the bullet and not the ballot papers 
The US and all of the international community are completely impréparés to confront the Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences . 
And unlike États from the breakup of Yugoslavia, which could draw inspiration from Europe, the lack of a legitimate Arab Democratic model makes it more difficult even for a democratic order.
Some Europeans and others mockery mock the failure of the US in Iraq , mockery the insanity or worse of their desperate policy following the mockery . 
And yet the underlying reasons for this failure go back much further , to the creation of all parts of Iraq in the 1920s by the British imperial authorities , who joined three disparate provinces of the conquered Ottoman Empire into a state which has never had any coherent identity . 
The foundation of Iraq itself is based on justice winners: the British Empire, having defeated the Ottomans, has given the power to the Sunni Arabs in a country where they were a minority.
Today , this arrangement is falling apart following a new round of victor's winners 
The consequences of this review of power are not yet clear . 
But it is certain that an Iraqi État consistent, whether it be unified, federal or Confederation, will emerge from a company whose part, justifiably, Saddam Hussein as a bloody dictator, and another part of the revered as a hero and martyr.
Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies.
In Iraq , it is now becoming apparent that some États cannot be saved without being destroyed .

The battle of the European Union for Turkey.
When the conspirators behind the suicide bombings in Istanbul launched their human bombs against synagogues and British offices , they had different audiences in mind . 
The European Union citizens that the political class is under pressure to join the earlier represent one of these public, possibly the most important.
The battle within the EU about Turkey's entry will take place on many fronts in the country itself , where the government is undertaking significant reforms to qualify for entry into the European Union at the negotiating table as soon as the European Council in December 2004 authorizes the Commission to open formal negotiations for accession to the European Union and among the public in the existing member countries . 
Of these three fronts, the last is the most demanding.
Most of the European Union citizens are uncomfortable today with the idea of Turkey's entry into the Union.
Those leaders for the Istanbul atrocities may have calculated leaders Islamic terrorism could increase this malaise . 
By tradition, the European citizens have always accepted the new members are pressing the door to join the club when it comes from the group of six countries of origin in 25 countries that it will bring together in the European Union in 2004.
Once a purely Western community, the union has pushed its borders out in all directions.
From next year , it will stretch from Northern Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south , to Ireland in the West to the Baltic States in the États . 
While the people truly have often fears that the newcomers get their jobs and their subsidies, they have always come to accept.
But the of Turkey is different . 
The 10 new countries joining the next year , and even the Balkan country that are now being offered the possibility of in the future , are all included in a traditional definition of Europe . 
None of them is big enough to disturb the current balance in the EU.
None of this applies in the of Turkey . 
Apart from a narrow strip of land , its territory belongs to Asia , and not to Europe , its culture is Islamic , and not Christian , and if it had to join the Union in 2013 , for example , its population will be far more important and the youngest of all EU member countries . 
Moreover , because of the Turkish borders with countries such Iran , Iraq and Syria , Turkey would bring to the European Union a disturbing neighbourhood a part of the world unable to develop a regional peace of its own , an outpost of fundamentalism and Islamic terrorism , a patchwork of fragile states full of nationalism , an area of conflict for militarisation , for nuclear power even , a region where the United States remain strategically involved and where Israel will always be the focus of anti Western feelings .
Upon Turkey's entering the union , the EU will become part of a wider Middle East agitated and disturbing , the most provocative in the world today . 
And yet , it is precisely because of these implications that the potential benefits of the arrival of Turkey into the EU outweigh the risks that it represents . 
Above all, the possibility of future entry into the Union is the most powerful force for the modernization of Turkey, and a modern, democratic and prosperous Turkey, is essential to Europe, whether it be inside or outside the Union.
Moreover, to enter the EU a kind of moderate Islam as now in Turkey will be of importance to the integration of Muslim minorities of European countries already large and growing even without the input of the population of Turkey.
Finally, with the opportunities that Turkey -- with its Islamic traditions, its regional contacts,and  resources and geography -- the EU will be better positioned to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will inevitably affect the security of Europe.
These are powerful arguments.
The big question is if they are powerful enough to influence the skeptical , European scepticism . 
It would take only country of the 30 states in the EU , perhaps country 2013 , to prevent states accession of Turkey . 
Some countries, without doubt, will want to let their people speak through a referendum that will leave the decision to the people, not only to parliament.
Even in Germany, where the constitution does not allow referendums, calls the referendum in the case of Turkey's entry and an opposition party has already announced he will do a central issue of the election campaign next year for the European Parliament elections.
Once the public unease with Turkey can reach a point of focus on the referendum for the entry if the country in the EU, there will be little chance that it can enter.
À the end of the negotiations , it seemed that À Turkey is ready for Europe but that Europe À not yet ready for Turkey . 
This is why the battle for the entry of Turkey has already started and what the terrorists of Istanbul appear to have understood.
Those who believe that the EU will be beneficial for Turkey as well as for Europe must also engage in the battle to defend their ideas.
There would be nothing worse for Turkey and Europe that European governments welcome Turkey without convincing their populations.
The terrorists will undoubtedly continue to stir up the fears of timid Europeans against an Islamist Turkey.
Let's hope that at the end , the attacks against innocent people in the crowded streets of Istanbul do not feed the Europeans' fears but rather a sense of solidarity with this dynamic and moderate country against a common enemy .

High fences make bad neighbours in Europe 
Good fences make good neighbours , as the poet Robert Frost wrote . 
Unfortunately, the European Union seems to take the poetic fantasy of Frost as an important political order.
Indeed , how the EU is preparing Does to welcome the citizens of the ten countries joining in May ? 
They puff slammed the nose in his laws implemented protection puff to force nose out before . 
In fact, the union is even worse.
Since there is no agreement at the European level on which regulations are applicable to new EU citizens, each member country sets its own rules without any coordination.
Some of these regulations in development are draconian.
Austria and Germany until now the two largest recipients of immigration from Eastern Europe , welcoming four fifths of them announced last year that they will restrict migration from États Member States for the entire duration of the seven year transition years . 
France and Belgium restreindront immigration of new European Union citizens during the first two years of the transition period, at least.
Sweden appeared to have adopted a liberal position for the first time , but will now open its borders and could reduce the access of immigrants to social aid . 
The Danish government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of Labor proposed to open the labour market to all new EU citizens who proof prove they have found job . 
Greece and Italy have remained silent until now , which probably means that they will retain the current restrictions on the new États States they will effectively be treated the same as every immigrant outside the EU . 
Thus , all countries bordering the États states will be closed to migration from the New États . 
All these dams reflect the general concern growing among the citizens of the new States to take advantage of generous welfare systems . 
Not surprising , that the most spectacular falls of popular support for the expansion recorded by the European polls happened in the EU countries benefiting from the services of social care the most generous .
support for enlargement is fading across the threshold of the entry of new countries .
Meanwhile , closing the door of the Union on its more recent citizens will not solve the problem of access to social services and will certainly harm economic growth . 
In labour markets of the European Union that are characterized by their labour mobility , such as those in Western labour and Southern Europe , migrants can play labour very important role . 
By increasing the average productivity , they contribute not only to boost growth , average also to achieve a higher head head income . 
In fact , because of distortions in the definition of wages often set without any real correspondence with the levels of productivity in the local workforce locale immigrant workers even contribute to reduce the unemployment rate in western and southern Europe . 
Moreover , closing the door will not solve the problem of access to social support , as illegal immigration is a worse threat than legal immigration ; it uses the resources available without contributing anything in return for social aid even though the bulk of immigrants are young and work .
The best way to deal with the fear of immigration as a source of abuse for the social systems is to adopt quotas transitional common and rather generous at EU level, then remove them quickly if they are not met.
Migration are preferable to any other kind of restriction quota they allow at least part of the potential benefits quota terms of support from immigration to be realized quota 
The Quotas could be determined according to the historical periods of strong immigration- according to an annual flow of 400,000 people for the European Union.
While these transitional restrictions  are implemented, the reforms must be taken to address the issues behind the public's fears about immigration.
The root of this fear, of course, lies in the vast differences in income that exist between the citizens of Lithuania, for example, and those of most EU countries.
Of course , economic convergence is a long haul . 
Thus , the redistribution policies of the European Union should be reformed to discourage people from poorer countries to shop emplette welfare . 
The problem remains the incompatibility Social Security, where the aid that it receives are based on the contributions, and the social support programmes, which involve transfers in cash.
All the European Union countries as well as new members must be encouraged to adapt their social support programmes which are also present in the new member states , so that they all meet all to certain basic requirements . 
A of these income guarantee guaranteed at European Union must gradually be set income guarantee with the intention , in the long term income of guarantee up a safety net throughout the European Union income guarantee one of its institutional pillars .

The challenges of Calderón
Mexico has finally found a new president last Friday , in circumstances really bad omens . 
Felipe Calderón was sworn in , braving the anger of his left wing opposition , and showing himself more clever than the Democratic Revolution Party PRD and its leader , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , but without , however , avoiding paying a high price .
Television around the world all had emissions same headlines on The New Mexican president comes to power emissions the chaos and violence . 
The Mexican institutions have resisted in the attacks of a left wing opposition virtually insurgent , acharnait in vain to prevent the appointment of Calderón , and the bitterness of a Revolucionario Institucional Party PRI , decided to leave Calderón take power , before fail miserably . 
If Calderón impressively overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles that dotted the path to his presidency , then the struggle to govern and transform Mexico has only begun .
Most Mexican journalists believe that it should be relatively easy for Calderón to do better than the failure in large part auto infligé of outgoing President Vicente Fox . 
Mexico needs need growth around two times faster than the one it has need under Fox a small 2 per year . 
If Calderón can maintain law and order and use his considerable political capacity to reach an agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms , he will succeed . 
But it is a simplistic . 
mandate , as well as president Ernesto mandate last four years , have not really been a mandate . 
Mexico had not experienced economic stability , low inflation , low interest rates , stable currency and steady though mediocre growth for ten years in a since the 1960s . 
For the first time, mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit became accessible to sections of the lower middle class: This year, it has built and sold more houses and bought more cars than ever before.
Similarly , although one can blame Fox for not silencing the protesters and an extremist and disruptive opposition , he has never resorted to a bloody crackdown which made the of his predecessors famous . 
Moreover , it took Mexico from its archaic cocoon in terms of foreign affairs and has pushed immigration and human rights at the center of the New Mexican international program .
Calderón do not think that negotiating with the PRI is an easy task, and it fails to make a coalition government, he believes to be the solution to the deadlock in Mexico sits since 1997.
Whatever the benefits of a cabinet comprised solely of members of his National Action Party PAN , this is not what Calderón was looking for . 
Similarly , it proved impossible to reach any agreement with the opposition regarding the inauguration ceremony , where the chaotic scenes were depressing as members of Congress tried to fight in the House while Calderón was ushered in through a back door for a quick haste . 
Mexico's economic problems might be similarly more intractable than many seem to think journalists.
Mexico experienced a sharp economic opening under former president Carlos Salinas from 1988-1994, a delayed but successful political opening under President Zedillo from 1994-2000 and, finally, a rotation of powers under Fox.
But the foundations of the old PRI corporatist system created in the 1930s remained intact , they represent the most significant obstacles to the growth success of Mexico .
The first pillar of this system is formed by the public and private monopolies that dominate the country.
The oil Pemex electric Comisión Federal de Elecricidad companies managed by the state have no competitors .
The private monopolies of telecommunications Telmex), television (lock, (Cemex cement, the manufacture of bread and tortilla (respectively bimbo and maseca) and the bank (Banamex / Citigroup and Bancomer / Banco Bilbao) perhaps have to compete abroad, but not at national level.
These monopolies are stronger than ever, and prices, supplies, the service and the quality will suffer.
The second pillar is formed by the unions who control the workers' movement in Mexico since the 1930s.
They have powers to hiring and firing workers non-syndiqcated, elect leaders by acclamation, receive mandatory contributions without transparency and a huge political power.
The Union of Teachers is the largest in Latin America , the Union of Oil Workers is the richest Social Security employees have thwarted any attempts to reform pensions or health for years .
The third pillar of the system is political monopoly.
For 70 years , the PRI has completely controlled the Mexican ; today they are three parties to do it , and nobody else can enter the political arena or have access to the huge public subsidies more than 500 million last year without their consent . 
The main parties write their own antitrust's , vote for their own subsidies , and choose their own elected . 
The absence of re-election in a row at any level strengthens the power of the machinery of the party: they are the choices of candidates, voters are only ratify at the ballot.
The challenges of Mexico are to release the movement of workers, break the private monopolies and open public monopolies to competition, and to lower barriers to entry restricting access to the political arena.
This may not be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly needed.
Calderón has to strengthen his presidency from the beginning.
To take possession of power is perhaps the only way to achieve that, even though it may seem risky.
Élu with only 35 of votes , without a majority Élu Congress , and with votes grab on the Élu of an economic slowdown votes the U . S Élu , things are very difficult . 
Given that roughly one third of the electorate think he mistakenly won , and given the uncertainty of the État of law in the country , the position of Calderón is even less enviable . 
Caution and patience event wouldn't be his best advisors

The Challenge of Mr Chávez
The recent parliamentary elections held in Venezuela have confirmed the trend that has placed the country on the front of every newspapers in recent years . 
President Hugo Chávez has demonstrated once again that he enjoys broad support among the poor and desperate , and that he was measure ahead of his opposition in terms of political skills , skill and ruthless character . 
However, there is a drop in attendance polls as each new election organised under the mandate of Mr Chávez and regularity dubious elections have become increasingly visible.
It is certain that the withdrawal of opposition  few days from the election was rather like the proclaimed Mr Chávez, a symptom of his own weaknesses rather than the problems of electoral process.
And it is almost certain that this same weakness is part of the progressive stifling of some aspects of traditional Venezuelan democracy . 
Even so , the mistakes of the opposition were significant , ranging from supporting the failed coup État against the democratically elected Mr . Chávez in April 2002 , to the attacks without result against PEDEVSA , the national oil company of Venezuela , in early 2003 . 
Nothing is more dangerous in politics that failure during direct confrontations.
In such circumstances , Mr . Chávez can afford to be bold , despite his political failures when it comes to acting in of his electoral base , the 50 or more of Venezuelans who live in poverty and despair . 
Poverty has increased since Mr Chávez came to power in 1998 the budget of the State the balance of trade are even more at the mercy of oil revenues today that this was the case in the past , , apart from the Cuban literacy programs close to the services of the naked feet doctors the whole public health of poor people has stagnated , if not worsen .
It is highly likely that the future will not bring any major change . 
Mr . Chavez will be able to change much of the constitution at will and parachute his men into the judicial system and the electoral authorities . 
He will continue to distribute subsidies from the oil revenues in the well-worn tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez.
So, Mr Chávez can get elected again next year and could well stay in power until the end of the following decade.
But if this is what the Venezuelan people want, so be it.
It is , after all , in their jurisdiction to decide who will govern , and how , as long as human rights are not systematically violated , or the democratic institutions suspended indefinitely , and the international standards of conduct of business are respected . 
According to this last point, at least, Mr Chávez has perhaps been further than should be allowed.
For years , he has been accused of taking the torch from Fidel Castro in supporting a radical and anti imperialist revolutionary we could even say revolutionary , rhetoric throughout Latin America . 
Perhaps it is time now for the nations in Latin America and the international community to take these allegations seriously.
Chávez is giving oil to the Caribbean nations and Cuba , and buying Argentine debt to support the of President Nestor Kirchner . 
À Mar del Plata in Argentina last month, he has openly participated in a rally against the free trade area of the Americas (FTAA), in the company, among others, Evo Morales, the Bolivian leader of the growers of coca leaf, which could well become the next president of Bolivia.
Similarly , Mr . Chávez openly supports Daniel Ortega , the perennial Sandinista candidate , in the Nicaraguan presidential elections and Shafick Handal , another perennial candidate of the FMLN , in El Salvador . 
His former ambassador to Mexico has openly and vehemently vehemence in some nights of the presidential election campaign of the mayor of Mexico City , Andrés Manuel López Obrador . 
It seems that the foreign policy of Mr Chávez follows a main theme the provocation of a major confrontation with the United States . 
The danger is , of course , that when this will happen , if it occurs subject whether Bolivia , the FTAA , human rights , or freedom of the press , it will be too late to control master . 
The challenge is to prevent the confrontation that Mr Chávez clearly intends to provoke .
Unfortunately, the government of George Bush has never been very keen to prevent conflict.
The other nations of the hemisphere have a direct interest to prevent a fight that would force them to take advantage and could even threaten their economic interests and national security . 
Although many positions of Mr Chávez has received some support from several nations in South America , the division he created in South America , with the help of Cuba's Castro between left and right , between the defenders of free trade and the bolivaristes between the pro and anti American , is essentially artificial , but certainly not impossible to overcome . 
Certainly, many Latin American leaders tried to appease and control Mr Chávez, without result.
It could be very expensive no to try anymore.
The last time revolutionaries were opposed to the United States , in Central America , in the 1980s , everyone lost . 
New divisions in the hemisphere created by a leader steeped in revenue would prove much more catastrophic .

The state nation revisited 
Now it is fashionable to say that the has lost its place . 
Globalization , it it said , means that nations can no longer control their own affairs . 
They must unite with others , as in the of the European Union , ASEAN or Mercosur , and count always with the international institutions like the United Nations , World Bank and the World Trade Organisation . 
Such a point of view is risky.
Indeed , when we look at it more closely , it is suspect , or simply wrong .
The nation state , with its strengths and weaknesses , is alive and well . 
To begin with its points , the nation state remains the only political space points which freedom will succeed . 
The democratic credentials of organisations such as the EU are dubious, and totally absent in the case of United Nations and other global institutions.
In addition , despite research frequent for new identities , European , Latin American or some research , and despite numerous references to a new cosmopolitanism research or even a global civil society , most people research at home in their own country , the nation research of which they are citizens . 
Migration is usually directed towards other countries.
Many countries are currently debating the integration of immigrants.
What is needed to become British, German or American?
Such debates about immigration make sense only we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations .
That is , for most people , the positive side of the nation state . 
The nation state has been for over two centuries and continues to be the for social and civic involvement for most . 
This is the context in which we see our freedoms protected or destroyed.
Countries freed from communism in 1989 , must have felt that restoring national sovereignty regain freedom were closely linked .
But there is , and there has always been , another more despicable aspect of the nation state it is nationalism . 
The nationalist can be aggressive or defensive , directed against or internally oriented . 
In both cases , it corrupts all attempt to create an international community of open societies . 
That was the problem in Iraq a nation state became a troublemaker in the region and beyond . 
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon is gaining ground: the revival of national protectionism.
The Doha round of trade talks is stalemated because the developed countries refuse to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn are trying to protect their fledgling industries.
Many prefer privileged relations to open trade.
In this area, the EU has often been helpful.
But today, the nationalist virus has even infected the European Union.
France, Spain and Poland have tried to keep their main industries in "national hands".
Suddenly, the European single market is forgotten, and a return to the fragmented markets takes root.
Let's consider , for example , the services from the European Commission . 
Although the workers' freedom of movement is one of the four freedoms of the single market , many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labour by suspending this freedom for as long as possible . 
Germany , in particular , argues that the high unemployment rate resulting from the reunification in 1990 it to close its labour market to the new eastern member states . 
Such trends are dangerous.
Historically , protectionism has often led to economic clashes , which can quickly degenerate into more serious conflict . 
Signs are not good, even in Europe.
A recent summit of EU leaders focused on energy policy a where is not only very desirable , but necessary . 
But even the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, clearly pro-European, went to the meeting with the explicit intention to put a brake on the creation of other European powers in this area.
The agreement Russian-German gas pipeline skirting around Poland and Lithuania, with the former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder as leader of game, has already contributed to the deterioration of relations between Poland and Germany, without mentioning the European cooperation.
For a time , the pendulum of public opinion has been dangling too far from the nation state and its role . 
This is one reason why so many people felt detached from their political leaders.
But it would be unfortunate and even dangerous, as the pendulum back towards the old-fashioned nationalism.
Nation are welcome , they are important elements of a liberal world order . 
But they must be open to cooperation and coordination with . 
We must take to resist the birth of a trend that recalls the events of the first years of the twentieth century , a trend that can lead result in a global disaster .

Is Gordon Brown eligible?
Obviously , Gordon Brown wants to succeed Tony Blair as British Prime Minister . 
It is less clear is that he is ready to do what's necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the coming parliamentary elections.
Indeed , he absolutely has to disavow Blair's legacy , which at least means promise to get Great Britain out of the Iraq war . 
Brown has coveted the office of Prime Minister since May 12 , 1994 , the fateful day when John Smith , the Labour leader in opposition , died of a heart attack . 
Two weeks later , on May 31 , Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London and person who should take over the party leadership . 
À the end of their discussion , they reached À double agreement Brown would stand aside and would support À , who promised in return to yield the to Brown later À . 
The fact that they have not agreed on the timing or circumstances of the transfer of power was also inevitable it was decisive .
They could not predict that Blair was going to win three election victories in 1997 , 2001 and 2005 , unprecedented for their party , and keep Labour Party in power for a period which was likely to last 13 years . 
The key for New Labour according to the by Blair who used his characteristic for manipulation was the management of the British economy . 
Since the Second World War , much of the British tried to manipulate the economy to promote in the short term , reaping disastrous results in the long term . 
This lamentable tradition was common to the Conservatives Labour , , as unfair as it may seem , it is Labour that has been most marked by a reputation of incompetence in economic management .
Brown has changed this reputation decisively.
It was probably the minister of the Économie most remarkable in British history, which is not because the inspiration or genius, but simply because it has created a new tradition, giving priority to moderate inflation, interest rates low and stable government finances.
Brown understood that these priorities were essential , not just for the British economy , but also for the long term objectives of the Labour party in power ; and he promoted the by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility to keep inflation low . 
The result was that Britain experienced a decade without precedent, marked by low inflation and relatively high economic growth, overtaking in this area many of its European counterparts.
However, despite the economic success, it has become increasingly clear that Blair was over.
Voters have gradually become disillusioned faced with the inevitable flaws of a too familiar government , and the party is increasingly unhappy with a leader who abused its hospitality .
Initially, Blair thought he could claim the right to stay in power for a third five-year term.
But the pressure he has suffered to leave has continued to grow, so that he has promised to leave summer 2007.
Nobody knows exactly when or how Blair will give up his way . 
a formal competition for the leadership of the party is organized , it seems likely that several candidates will be running for office .
That said , almost all observer authoritative authority in the area seem to agree in observer Brown authority by far the most likely to become the next observer prime authority . 
That's the easy . 
From here on out , nobody seems to be certainty À Brown knows what to do or has the certainty À conduct and win new legislative elections for certainty À 
Its reputation for command and control of the economy is as well as undisputed, but he has not given almost no indication of what they think of other government's policies.
He remained cold and almost silent , visibly anxious to get his inheritance , but gave absolutely no clue what would change if he did .
If there is something he cannot promise, is to continue the policy of Blair.
If Brown chooses continuity , he will lose . 
After ten years of Blair, he must offer one or more policies that will mark a clear divide.
The most obvious choice in policy concerns Iraq if Brown want to win an election as leader of Labour , he must abandon Blair's politics and announce the quick withdrawal of British troops . 
In tactical terms , it is simple it is obvious whatever spurious reasons and illegal data may have been presented at the beginning excuses to invade Iraq , everyone now knows that this war was a political , strategic and moral disaster .
Everyone knows that it cannot be won , if it means something and Brown knows that both war and the slavish submission of Britain to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in the country . 
This is a problem that must need addressed address , but for now , none of the major political parties has dared to touch it . 
Over the past three weeks , the Labor , liberal Democrats and Conservatives have all held their annual conference . 
Everyone was focused on national policies , no one dared bring up the subject of policies , because they all knew that would raise policies issue of the withdrawal , which in turn would policies a major and possibly explosive debate about relations between policies and the United States . 
Will Brown be brave enough to confront the issue of Iraq ? 
Probably not.
He may very well decide that it is too difficult , in which he will only be an caretaker prime minister , condemned to lead the last three years of Labour without any hope of winning the next elections . 
This is not what he had planned in passing his market with Blair in 1994 .

The latest innovations in the economy
The Great Depression propulsa John Maynard Keynes onto the scene of economic thinking propulsa 
According to Keynes , private investment is inherently unstable because of the modes and engouements passengers among investors , changes in the Animal Spirits businessmen or because falling prices may disrupt the economic system . 
Keynesians believed that prudent policies central banks raising or lowering interest rates policies reduce fluctuations in private investment could part policies stabilizing the economy . 
But they believed that the government should agree to be directly involved, with generous tax policies, to maintain the overall level of spending in a stable economy.
Such a policy, pensaient-ils, bannirait forever the spectre of mass unemployment, as happened during the Great Depression.
It could eventually also guarantee full employment in an effective . 
They expected that near full employment would raise the threat of inflation.
After all , why should workers and unions reduce their pay if governments support spending every time the threat of unemployment is menacing ? 
A important restriction of the requirements for high wages (the fear of being made redundant when unemployment rises) had also jumped.
What can replace it?
For the first postwar generation , the prevailing response was shop social would replace it . 
The unions are pliaient requirements of the government to rein in their own demands for wage increase and the governments have plieraient the requirements of the trade unions on public spending and social benefits.
Keynesian thought assures us that the Great Depression can never happen again . 
But his solution to the problem of rampant inflation didn't have staying power , it utterly collapsed in the 1970s .
Following the first inflationary crisis of the 1970s in À major industrialized countries , the predominant economic thinking in À countries turned toward the semi monetarist . 
Milton Friedman's victory was never as comprehensive as the Keynesians'.
However, in the mid-1980s, politicians of the world match on the following points:
Central banks should engage in a credible credibility on price stability in the long term . 
Central banks should accept that the average rate of unemployment is determined not by "cyclical" factors but by structural factors that they should not try to resolve.
Announce and try to maintain a monetary growth goal is an easy way for the central bank to disclose its main intentions , to gain credibility and to people a way of checking whether sound policies are followed . 
Monetarism was but the image of Keynesianism . 
It seemed to ensure that the inflation of the 1970s could never happen again.
But it offers no solution to the structural unemployment problem that has appeared in Western Europe.
The last 15 years have shown that monetarism is poorly equipped to handle the challenges of falling prices in the context of companies and banks heavily in debt, as the Keynesian solution was not made to handle the challenges of inflation.
In the 1970s and 1980s some , including myself , blamed the bankruptcy of social democratic to control inflation on wrong decisions . 
Politicians had not understood that the increase in social benefits was the price to pay inevitably for lower wages , while the trades union leaders had not understood that if the corporate social democracy is not limiting inflation , the political power would be right and rising unemployment would be used to limit limit . 
Today , we still blame other bad decisions for the current alarming economic conditions in the heart of the industrialized world more than a decade of stagnation in Japan accompanied by deflation , deflation which is present in Germany accompanied by recession .
The European Japanese central banks have not lowered their interest rates enough nor early enough regulators of the banking sector have turned away from the vagaries of speculative lending politicians have refused to extend adequate fiscal policies .
But politicians and central bankers cannot always be as capable of making the right decisions . Good policies must be designed to operate despite a lack of vision and good advice from leaders . 
Inflation in the 1970s was but a normal failure of savings political policies . 
threat threatens Japan , Europe and perhaps even the United States threat long period of irreconcilable between potential and threat is a failure of normal semi monetarist orthodoxy that threat dominated macroeconomic policies at the heart of the threat world since the early 1980s . 
We are going around in circles.
Without forming a coalition , no government would allow another collapse of liquidity , happened in the 1930s , or the failure of banks and companies on a scale that would put the entire economy in danger .
This is an increasing spiral.
The macroeconomic problems in the world are real but will not lead to another Great Depression, largely because politicians remembers the first great depression.
We need a new revolution of economic policies in way Keynesian and semi monetarist , a revolution that will not quite lose of the successes of the previous revolutions , but will eliminate their intrinsic failings . 
Where could this revolution be coming from?
Perhaps of Ben Bernanke, the new governor of the Federal Reserve, whose long career has always been concerned in asset prices, the role of adverse selection on the credit market and the need for central banks in trouble not only the current operations in the short term on the markets open.
He firmly believes that banks should try to pave the way for long-term investments in action.
Bernankéisme you said?

The fate of mankind / The hopes of humanity
For some time now , and certainly since the terrorist attacks against the USA on 11 September 2001 , as when we saw the of Kosovo , Sarajevo , Srebrenica , Rwanda and Congo on our televisions , the no longer of more than war or threats of war , violent deaths or threats of violent deaths . 
Throughout the world, we are all very clear about the power of our weapons.
From missiles with nuclear to trucks full of fertilisers or explosives worn on a belt , we have used our technological capacity to develop largely the dark side of our violent species nature in the role of predator . 
I certainly do not intention to minimize or reject this aspect of human history intention current events . 
I do not want people forget that over half the previous century has gone for some to kill by bullets, gas, stab, burning or starve a tenth of men living on this planet, either because of the first world war and famine that followed the great leap of Mao.
However, it is not a complete overview.
In fact , the human people of the twentieth century and the various slaughterhouses diverse people are readying as of today may not appear in people future to be the most important part of our experience people our human condition , nor to be what our descendants will people as their history . 
For them, the most important features of our experience will perhaps be:
Overall, the 20th century remains in many parts of the world desperately poor because of one or several reasons: (1) a criminal governance; (2) a lack of machinery, useful and productive in the global economy out of subsistence agriculture and industry under qualified services; (3) a public education system absent, which could make the public education and skills needed for the use of these machines; (4) barriers (legal and physical) to prevent people, where demand is low, to sell the product of their work where demand is high.
However , towards the end of the twentieth century , these four reasons of have generally been reduced . 
The governments such as that of Kim Jong Il in North Korea are very rare these days.
Almost all countries in the world are no more than a generation away from nearly universal literacy.
The speed of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention innovation open to all regions where a student of diploma be engineer . 
And above all , the customs barriers preventing goods produced in Mauritius , Mozambique Mauritania from being sold in New York or Berlin Santiago or Tokyo are falling quickly .
The enormous cargo have apparurent on the seas recently have revolutionised cargo trade apparurent a generation . 
New information technologies used in the management means inland transport and distribution will probably have the same means . 
, the advent of the Internet and technology fiber optic cable will support both the global services trade side that made the introduction of steamships iron hull hundred and fifty years earlier for international trade in agricultural and industrial products .
Certainly there will be a generation for whom these changes are felt throughout the world.
However , at the heart of the industrialised world of rich countries , are already worrying about these revolutions that are appearing on the horizon . 
In fact these concerns will be strengthened and aiguiseront as fears of the citizens of these rich countries aiguiseront the barriers of international trade will fall and the aiguiseront of wealth , the social order and the political aiguiseront of the industrialised world will be insensitive to their aiguiseront . 
For the whole world, however, the next two generations are those that will provide extraordinary opportunities for economic growth and international prosperity.
There very well may boot a at the end of history , boot all .

The defeat of Argentine néoliberalisme liberalism 
In the 1990s , set implemeted policies that belonged to almost 80 of neoliberal programme . 
It opened its economy to international and international capital ; it sought to ensure low inflation and a stable currency . 
It strove to improve its legal system so that its decisions are consistent with international laws to generate some confidence when regards compliance with contract law , with or without bribes .
This did not work.
However, nobody can say that the 1990s were catastrophic, despite their consequences that led to the dreadful summer of 2002.
Life was far more difficult during the Dirty War of the 1970s , when an Army stripped of all credit threw the women out of helicopters in the South Atlantic Ocean and the urban warfare shot the people because . . . because . . . well , simply because ! 
The 1980s were hardly better.
Opening by a debt crisis at its height caused by a massive rise in the US interest height and of the dollar's value , the decade ended height hyper inflation generated from within , which caused a decline height 10 in Argentina , lagging behind the leading global height . 
During the 1990s, by contrast, GDP per head in Argentina increased by 25%, with highs and lows, only to lose all the profit of that growth over the last four years.
Until the end of last winter, the problems of Argentina seemed to be little more than a à-coup unpleasant but temporary, as the crisis of the "Mexico's tequila" over the years or even the crises of the East Asia in the years 1997-1998 turned out to be mere heckling face short-term and not turning points.
Such optimism is impossible these days, and there is little hope that this country's recent stock market crash would only have temporary effects.
The opinions of institutions , like that of the Under Secretary État the US Treasury John Taylor , is that opinions collapse of Argentina is due to more than its political class opinions 
I only partly share this part . 
The leaders of Argentina were warned repeatedly that maintaining a constant exchange rates annexation pegging the peso to the dollar could cause a recession if the dollar's value rose . 
The Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained without the relationship of the national debt to the GDP falling . 
, during the boom years , between 1993 and 1998 , public spending exceeded tax revenues enough to increase the debt to GDP ratio from 29 to 44 .
When the dollar rose and the recession had gone , politicians of little worth were unable to balance the government's budget État time and have not shown enough courage to balance the budget when the situation hardens . 
The final blow was dealt the government decided in full crisis to keep the bank deposits fixed rate in dollar and putting the debt from banks in pesos , putting it into bankruptcy , the entire financial system of the nation by a stroke of a pen .
The position of the ruling class is simple If any of those three disastrous measures had been taken , Argentina would not have entered a crisis or , at worst , suffered a mini crisis of the Mexican type .
Argentina's neoliberal program in the 1990s was foolproof , according to this view , the Argentine politicians gave the image of a large community of astute imbeciles .
There is , however , another way to see the Argentinan . 
If one considers that the country's political system has long been very predictable , regularity producing governments that promised more than they could implement . 
Who promise to the wealthy oligarchs not to levy high promise . 
promise promises a generous social insurance system to workers and consumers promise 
Promising rapid economic development , infrastructure spending jobs of low binding and enjoyable for those with relations , etc . . 
Overall , these promise indicated that any view on the national product always excédait promise of 100 . 
Popular demand requiring that the government meet them all can never be satisfied.
Add to it an unfair distribution of wealth and income , the lack of social commitment between the middle class and the working class , and a long tradition of political violence , and you get the perfect cocktail of a policy where opposes . 
The basic political battle over distribution of wealth in Argentina remains to be resolved.
Any political force which will try to manipulate the auction by promising that it can do is doomed to defeat.
And , in Argentina , the big budget deficits are a law of nature , an unshakable fact .
In that , the Argentinian interest rates cannot fall and be affordable except for short and rare periods of time . 
Everyone knows that the Argentine political system generates a chronic deficit , and we know that this only indicates that the interest payments on debt were doomed to explode . 
Considering the fact of the absolute lack of stability of the dynamics of Argentinian debt , indexing the exchange rate on a strong currency could not continue . 
Free access to international capital markets and bank accounts in dollar implies that when the index for the exchange rate come into conflict with the logic of Argentine politics producer of deficit, the result could only be catastrophic.
If the current crisis has been skillfully manipulated , if Argentina had experienced another decade of rapid growth , the conflicts born of the redistribution of wealth would have been moderates . 
After all , Europe before the second world war was proof of the worst worldwide the riots of right wing gather in France to general strikes in Britain through the civil war in Spain and fascism in Italy , without mentioning the aggressive consolidation of power in Germany by the Nazis . 
And yet, Western Europe's postwar never encountered any problems of public order which found a solution while maintaining a strong currency and growth.
I only partially share this of view , however . 
Yes , the Argentine government has made serious errors , its politicians have sinned against the gods of errors economy . 
But the punishment should be so sharp and severe?

The false promises of private pensions
One of the most bizarre statements made during debates on insurance that are bothering the richest countries in the world is that pension schemes funded by governments and whose achievements are fixed such as the Social Security system in America are outmoded . 
These programmes were enough , according to this argument , at programmes time of the Great Depression generation programmes the post Second World War , when the economy programmes based on industry , but they have become programmes in of the tech tech network networked , programmes industrial present . 
Defenders of this argument propose a different model.
The companies agree today to support pensions employees by contributing to their private savings and pensions governments should offer or demand to help the private pensions . 
The value of these accounts varies according to the market and is not based on a system of benefits that guarantees a real fixed sets of resources , available at the time of retirement . 
This argument is strange because it takes the economic situation the wrong range . 
When many companies offer their employees of pension with fixed long-term benefits, the government has no interest in establishing a parallel retirement system with fixed benefits and to ask employees to participate.
After all , in that context , employees who attach great importance to retirement benefits can go to work for companies that systems them . 
The key advantages of a system where the government requires employees to participate to a national social security system are combined for employees who should really attach great importance to a fixed benefits pension system to determine their real preferences .
They are also combined for employees who do not have the ability to negotiate to get their bosses to provide pensions that they want and that they really need.
Few companies are willing to offer long term pension benefits . 
One reason is that companies today are much more aware of their own fragility companies the long term than they were in the years companies the Second World War . 
Even IBM in the United States , which prides itself on its stability , do not take the risk to provide retirement benefits . 
The pension posed by defined benefit was normally offset by two benefits for pension companies that systems them . 
First , the fact that leaving the firm usually implied the reversement this savings with décote accuracy increased employees 
Then , the optimistic assumption of accountants , complacent about the benefits of retirement assumption , associated with the ability of large companies to assumption greater risks , improved the balance sheet that companies assumption submit to their investors . 
Today, the risks are seen as much bigger and the benefits as much less.
Because of this , fewer employers are systems fact would look like fixed pension . 
This reduction of the fixed benefits systems in all the rich countries of the global economy is not a good , because the configuration of the prices of goods suggest that young and middle aged people attach great importance to the benefits . 
Historically, the gap between the profits expected on goods at a lower risk such that the Treasury or the good investment and property at high risk such that the actions or real estate was generally very high.
In sum , some economists say , including Harvard's Robert Barro and mathematicians like Benoit Mandelbrot , this may be due to the fact that risky investments are actually far riskier than suggested by theories and standard financial techniques .
In my opinion , at least , this is partly due to the memory of the 1930s and 2000 , when the stock market had suffered greatly , which occupies too large a place in spirit . 
The employees and other holders of goods is an important value to the safety and predictability, also a system of fixed their retirement benefits is very valuable.
But in the today's world, only national governments are big enough to implement such systems and ensure that pensions will genuinely be available when employees will end their activity.
I am still social bias enough to believe that if there is an economic bias or an advantage in which people attach great importance and bias only the government can offer , then it is bias duty to provide it . 
We economists all know there are many disadvantages to pushing the government out of its basic role , which is to provide real public services such as defence , security and justice , while offering people incentives to offset the effects of the real failures of the market . 
Where the private market has the flexibility of two hands , the government bureaucracy has no more than that of two inches . 
But the collection of taxes wages tens of millions of employees and the writing wages tens of millions cheques retirement is part wages the semi automatic , routine tasks the government can carry out wages well . 
When private companies are pulling out of fixed benefits systems, it is even more important and valuable that the government understands it, while our post-industrial society enters an era of networks, than it was in the past.

Islamic movements and the paradox of 
The wave of anger that is stirring up the Arab world after the publication in Denmark , a few months ago , of cartoons representing the Prophet Mohammed , the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of the Iranian regime are the why political Islam is a fundamental problem on the international scene . 
But there can be a single answer to all the issues that arise.
We must abandon the idea that there is a monolithic Islamist movement.
Islam has various forms that have emerged as the main alternative to the secular Arab nationalist nationalists whose legitimacy , based on the national liberation struggle , has disappeared due to their inability to solve the economic and social problems , rule law and ensure fundamental freedoms . 
In Palestine , for example , Islamists have prevailed over Fatah because they have suffered for years under his bad governance enduring the trials of Israeli occupation .
Long ago, America and Europe share a deep-seated fear of "The Islamic alternative" to the nationalist leaders and secular as Fatah and defend the status quo.
But the Monarchs and secular Arab dictators crushed any opposition, making mosques the only place from which any political commitment was possible.
Today , political Islam can no longer be contained , because we cannot build democracy by pushing parties who have strong social basis . This is what the example of Algeria tragically illustrated 15 years ago . 
The only alternative to authoritarianism is to achieve a transition that allowa the Islamists to participate in political life, while encouraging them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game.
In many countries , the Islamist parties , which are more or less conservative , are ready to play the game . 
It is no coincidence that they are represented in the parliaments of all coincidence countries that have initiated political reforms , whether in coincidence where Hezbollah is now within a democratically elected government coincidence Jordan and Morocco . 
In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood has become a force to be reckoned with in parliament, despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in elections last year.
In Iraq, free elections have revealed the huge influence of Islamic movements.
In Turkey , the democratic transition brought to power an Islamist party , the party ruling justice and economic development . 
Under his conduct , the Turkish government has undertaken various important democratic reforms conduct has begun negotiations regarding the admission of Turkey into the EU conduct 
The Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda, even if some of the most conservative elements within them hold ideological positions that may be close to it.
The risk of a political transition that will lead the victory of the Islamist parties is a paradox of democracy that Europe and America must accept if they want to encourage a policy that includes all the political sensitivities – in other words to the exact opposite to the imposition of democracy as it has held in Iraq, under occupation of foreign troops.
One of the most negative consequences of intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of a "clash of civilizations" between the West and Islam, which creates a climate conducive to Islamist movements.
The Muslim world moved to make political reforms well the war against terrorism , the Muslim reformers did not wait the EU gained political weight they acted .
Such movements have not been created in the United States or in Europe after September 11th , and they do not expect a signal or from them to act . 
The success of moderate Muslims, risk, however, depending on the attitude of EU and US to them.
It is not necessary to show that democracy is the best way for Palestinians if they want to succeed in creating their state . 
That largely depends on the direction that the new government of Hamas will take , which will or will not turn itself into a democratic strength , respectful of the law , democracy and international law . 
But that will depend on Israel and the international community , who should do everything in their power to encourage the emergence of a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as capital .
Promote democracy among the Palestinians will not prevent the international community to ask Hamas to definetely renounce terrorism, to demilitarise, to comply with the Palestinian constitution and recognize Israel's existence.
But it does not mean that we should impose sanctions on the Palestinian people after they expressed themselves democratically.
If you want to strengthen the recent Palestinian democracy , it would be a terrible mistake that would have a negative impact in the other Arab countries seeking to reform themselves . 
Similarly , to recognize the right of nonviolent Islamist parties to participate in political life does not shift renouncing political and ideological struggle to overcome ultra conservative and sometimes totalitarian of society . 
Fighting racism , defending tolerance and respect the religious feelings of others does not presuppose questioning freedom of respect press or accepting the censorship Islamic militants call respect , even if valid religious feelings are respect , as in the of the Danish cartoons . 
Islamist of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically . 
This political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy because it allows all ideas to compete competition with each other . 
Political Islam is a risk , but we can reduce that by developing an appropriate strategy , adapted on a case by case sense , that promote democracy , but not by results the of democratic choice .

The war against "democratization"
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza pose a serious to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean . 
They are inflicting heavy penalties precisely on the people of the region who have led free and fair elections, and they undermine the legitimacy of democracy of Israel.
Last year , the Cedar Revolution made Lebanon an example of democracy in the Arab world . 
The enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed these changes has fallen flat . The elections that recently took place in Palestine another long standing international are experiencing the same scenario . 
The message is clear it is preferable that Israel , the only country in the region to meet the État of law , is surrounded by authoritarian regimes where the election results are predictable , rather than Democratic États where militants are likely to gain power . 
It happened in Palestine and this could well happen in Egypt if elections are conducted in free and fair . 
The Arab nationalist governments could justify the resistance to political reforms and the repression of any internal opposition, in particular, growing Islamic movements.
It is now clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean can not exclude Islamist movements and the success of the process depends largely on the degree to which participation of these movements is provided in the arena . 
Of course we still need to renounce violence as a means of accession to power.
Contain political Islam, or try to "eliminate" the Islamists in the military without taking account of the national political process (and not to mention human lives), is not a solution, because the voters made not Islamic movements.
The efforts of reformist reformists in the region to integrate these movements in the reformists sphere have received a severe blow . 
Democracies have long known that reprisals and indiscriminate distinction which , by definition reprisals allies and enemies fighters as well as civilians reprisals a serious violation of international law , as has reprisals observed by Louise Arbour , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reprisals 
They also know that such actions are stirring up radicalism and have the impact that we know only too well today.
Hezbollah is , after all , a child of the resistance of Lebanon to the Israeli invasion in 1982 . The Party of God is trying to gain ascendancy at home and in the region by presenting itself the defender of the Arab Islamic cause , particularly in Palestine .
Any strengthening of its power will in fact weaken Lebanon and the democratic forces in the region.
The extended absence of a real active engagement of the United States in the Middle East peace process is partly responsible for the current morass . 
For nearly six years, they have not taken to diplomatic initiative weight to resolve the Palestinian issue, nor to follow the Syrian track (Israel is still in the Golan Heights).
Moreover , even as we begin to think that the tragedy of Iraq veil shown the limits of unilateral disarmament and preventive military strategies , the Bush administration encourages the Israeli military action this time against a country painfully trying to consolidate its democratic reform and to reaffirm its sovereignty from Syria . 
Bush most promising initiative , to promote democracy throughout the Middle way , was paralyzed by the intervention in Iraq and by the civil war that followed . 
The project is now crushed under the weight of the inability to protect the fragile democracy in Lebanon and the democratic experience of Palestine.
The reaction unconvincing on the European Union in the conflict in Gaza and Lebanon somewhere between the understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate response to Israel (not "an eye for eye," but "ten eye for an eye," according to the presidency of the EU Council), revealing how the EU depends on us to put an end to violence.
If the present conflict does not encourage Europeans to speak with one voice , it means they have learned nothing from disunity , and weakness , which harmed them during the war in Iraq .
It would need a European initiative backed means credible military deterrent , combining the strengths of means EU , Turkey and the Arab countries , to be dispatchée in Lebanon and Gaza under a UN mission . 
Europe must not only demand an immediate ceasefire and end the interference of Syria and Iran in Lebanon , but it must also have the means to translate its requirements into facts and provide massive aid for the reconstruction of Lebanon . 
The end must support ending the embargo on Palestine and the pressing for the creation of end État urgent . 
A common European front could persuade the United States to give enough time to Lebanon and Palestine to consolidate their democratic processes , and to isolate the radical elements of Hamas and bring Hezbollah to dissolve its private army .
With the American project in ruins , a credible European policy delegitimizing the war and supporting democracy in the region is crucial .

The economic economy 
No economy is a universe , independent , governed by law universe from laws , morality or politics . 
The most interesting economic issues tend to be on the border between neighboring disciplines.
This cannot become more clear than in the interaction between economic processes and the environment.
The peculiarity of this exchange is not to be governed by peculiarity laws of mechanics , but by those of thermodynamics peculiarity particularly the law of entropy that the amount of peculiarity energy that can be transformed into mechanical work peculiarity with time an irreversible process culminating in the peculiarity death . 
At the behest of Nicholas Georgescu Roegen whose work on the relationship behest economic processes and was pioneers many researchers behest without success to formulate a entropic theory of behest economy and society , especially during the 1970s . 
The entropic point of entropique assumes that because of their multiple interactions with nature entropique economic processes produce irreversible consequences . 
We draw in the stocks of non renewable natural resources oil and mineral resources , for example and dégradons or modify quality of other resources for example , water and agricultural land by imposing an exploitation rates higher than their ability to regenerate . 
The exploitation of non renewable resources sets the speed of economic rate environment from ecological , which contributes to the deterioration of the biosphere , especially by irreversible climate change . 
The law of entropy reminds us that we will pass along to future generations an heritage less and less suited to their needs than that which we inherited . 
Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions.
behalf to what principle could one ask China and behalf to limit their economic dynamism to reduce their collection behalf the planet's natural resources ? 
The slower growth in developed countries is not the consequence of voluntary restraint restraint , but rather our much higher standard of and our inability to solve our own economic imbalances . 
We cannot impose the poor that the pace ecological, while it is to be released that has enriched.
For a similar reason, "or even stagnation is not a solution in the developed world: it would be that handles the inequalities, either by a regime of redistribution to équirépartition resources.
This would be the choice between an unsustainable and an totalitarian utopia . 
But , fortunately for us , our evolution depends not only on the entropy , but also on the increase of knowledge and technical progress a process as inevitable as the decline in stocks of non renewable resources and environmental degradation . 
the economy is rather entropic regards resources historic for production , organisation dissemination of knowledge . The prospects for a sustainable development in economic environmental terms in the area developed between these two dynamic processes the chosen level of growth should be based on a level of knowledge sufficient to ensure the survival of the system .
But nature and knowledge are public goods that require the intervention of the state to be products in sufficient quantities . 
The only way to the problem of the finitude of our world way to maintain area much finitude as possible between way and history by investing in finitude and research in way prospect of share renewable energy resources , way consumption energy related to finitude standard of living , way slow the pace of exploitation finitude natural resources . 
Such a strategy may seem pointless if it only makes us withdraw to allow others to enrich themselves more quickly.
But as for control of two dynamics, the solution of ecological constraints could be a boost to growth.

The race to embryonic stem cells continues
Scientific research is generally undertaken to improve our lives , but it is also an industry , an industry that represents a huge investment on the of governments and companies . 
The stakes and the potential benefits of a small of research subjects are exceptionally high , and this is why the recent announcement that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo suk falsified the results of his research on stem cells received such a response . 
The episode highlights the continued international medical research that is unfolding in the field of stem cells . 
This is probably one of the biggest challenges in all medical history that is accessible to everyone , everybody , truly everybody could win the jackpot .
The last great scientific games of this type dates back to the time of games human genome initiative , which promises to radically change the games . 
This study was launched by the United States from discoveries in the of Japan nuclear bombing on the understanding of the scope of genetic damage in the long . 
The research effort done on embryonic cells and their potential is just as important because it will allow a full medical revolution just as important.
An embryonic cells is special because it can reproduce a form different cells itself . 
When a skin or liver cell , for example , cannot replicate more skin or liver , embryonic stem cells , which are most robust at the beginning of human development , are prototype cells .
When an egg fertilisé turns into embryos and fetuses, these cells are original show somehow to cells that produce can turn into skin, eye, liver or blood.
We need to find out how this transformation is unleashed.
Such knowledge would lead to enormous progress that could give rise to patents.
Strong attention is focused on genetic diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and muscular dystrophy.
In these cases, stem cells would be used to repair nerve tissue.
This would also benefit for patients with brain damage or the backbone, any patient who suffered an attack and paralysis.
This would spill out to parallel fields , such as gene therapy .
An embryonic cell changes of identity via a process of outbreak , a signal that literally activates the liver cell gene in the embryonic version of the cell . 
When researchers how to activate these switches , it may be possible to introduce embryonic stem cells in the human body and to activate drive of the damaged tissue . 
It is not surprising, given its huge potential, that teams of researchers have rallied almost everywhere to engage in research on stem cells.
This race has gained some momentum since the main player in research , the United States , are available , because of the influence of religion on the even if the State of California has decided not to deny and recently approved a subsidy of 3 million for research on embryonic stem cell . 
The promise is so great , science having little need promise massive infrastructure . Many small countries have rushed to engouffrés promise the vacuum created by the promise States . 
Any competent medical research centre can put itself on this race , be it in Mexico , in Éthiopie , race or in Yemen . 
The winner can bring to his country's economy the equivalent of a Saudi oil . 
But even if everyone can win , science , at this level , is not just a simple eureka or in a single step that would end end race . 
The findings are progressive, and, because this is science, each step is announced and tested.
This is how institutions that participate in research can gain momentum, how leaders attract talent, resources and prestige in an intellectual environment that is not easy.
There is in the competition in many other small shops, jostling to produce quick results and impressive.
In May 2005 , the research centre of Hwang in Seoul achieved a first of success . 
They claimed to have developed a technique wherein new embryonic stem cells in perfect condition could be cloned from ordinary cells.
It was big news , because they implied that a sufficient number of embryonic stem cells could be created without controversy , allowing everyone to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W . Bush has described as the use of a life to save a life .
In addition , the Koreans are then switched to a stage features in our days and have called for the patent rights of the process . 
It was almost plausible for a time that South Korea would become the superpouvoir global health issues . 
We now know that the Korean researchers made the whole up . 
The survey conducted by an investigative panel of Seoul National University survey that cloned stem cells were actually created by in survey fertilisation . 
The fraud has stunned the scientific community , particularly the fact that the declaration researchers' were so clearly false . 
Why did they even put their careers and reputations at stake?
Medical research has always faced many challenges , even when the scientific science is matter of discovery . 
Today, the challenges are complicated by policy, market forces and national interests.
With embryo research , vast fortunes depend on the group which will take the head , wherever its laboratory may be . 
While competition is heating up , we must await stunning drugs , and no doubt other subterfuge in terms of public relations .

Islam and Asian Chinese diaspora . 
When the prime minister of Malaysia, Dr Mahathir Mohamed, recently announced that it intends to resign, the Malays of Chinese origin, has joined the party loyalists of the Malays Mahathir, asking him to reconsider its position.
When Mahathir agreed to stay, even just for 16 months, the sighs of relief from the Malaysian Chinese were the most audible of all.
The fact that Malaysians are ethnic Chinese rallied on the side of Dr Mahathir marks a quiet revolution in the political that shows how nationalist image of relaxed Mahathir during his 22 years in power . 
It also shows how the ethnic Chinese have changed their opinion on the nationalist movement , which previously seemed . 
At the of the overthrow of colonial leaders of Southeast Asia four decades ago , the ethnic Chinese often fled nationalist movement fighting for independence . 
Some movements saw the Chinese as foreigners or as intrinsically disloyal people for having disproportionately benefited from foreigners of imperial rule . 
The anti Chinese mob movements was widespread in the region . 
In the decades that followed, most Chinese have continued to be wary of political parties linked to former national liberation movements.
That fear is waning in Malaysia.
Chinese citizens of Malaysia now consider the prime minister Mahathir as a bulwark against a new form of violent extremism: the threat posed by Islamic fundamentalism.
Such a bulwark is necessity for members of the vast Chinese bulwark throughout Southeast necessity , not only in Malaysia , bulwark Islamic extremism is necessity a small threat , but also in bulwark , where necessity of Chinese have been killed and injured bulwark riots in necessity years and thousands more others seen their necessity properties or lost . 
Most of the ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia admired like a the presence of even a hint of allegiance to an age old distinction between faith and the state in a Muslim ruler . 
When this distinction exists in Islamic believers like Mahathir , evidence of a secular tolerance represents a rare signs modernity and commitment to progress . 
Dr . Mahathir has always been a cool headed modernist . 
He has recently begun to acknowledge that the Malays first that have been promoted since 1969 have failed to give to the Malaysian political elite necessary for a new modern economy . 
Mahathir calls on young Malays to work harder , even if he is fully aware that such an appeal is unpopular .
A large part of this new tone in the ethnic policies of Malaysia went unnoticed because of the uproar surrounding the efforts made by Mahathir to discredit her former member, Anwar Ibrahim.
This campaign against Mr Anwar has cost the party of Mahathir, the United Malay National Organisation (onmu), much of its support among ethnic Malays.
Indeed, in the national elections of 1999, Mahathir retained power only thanks to the Chinese voters.
The non-Malays hope that from now on he will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays.
Such reform still like anathema among the Malays . 
The ethnic Chinese of Malaysia are also impressed by the clever response of Dr . Mahathir to American to fight terrorism . 
The Prime Minister has used this opportunity to soften his image of man against the West by reaffirming his modernizer and secular position against all those who sympathize with Islamic extremism . 
In doing , it has revitalized the multicultural base of the National Alliance that has led Malaysia since independence was proclaimed in 1957 .
All this enabled him to win the Chinese community in Malaysia over to his side.
Contrast this situation with the Chinese in Indonesia , a country where everything that is ancient and modern is associated with a political and cultural compliance with the nation state . 
For 30 years , former President Suharto consistently established racial discrimination against the ethnic Chinese while favoring a few privileged comrades who allowed his family and his fellow military to make huge profits which were improperly acquired . 
In the eyes of the indigenous majority remained poor , such favouritism depicted the people as corrupt and greedy businessmen . 
Despite the memories of the massacre of Chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s, the Chinese Indonesia were not prepared to confront hatred huge deployed during the riots in May 1998 where arson and looting and rape of a number of Chinese women have ravaged the Chinese community.
Such violence casts a shadow on the ethnic relations in Indonesia.
The successive Indonesian governments led by Presidents Habibie, Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri all encouraged the Chinese to play their usual leading role in commerce.
However, Indonesian officials are reluctant to ensure Chinese that they will retain equal rights as citizens and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to prevail.
Current tensions between sécularistes , religious believers , and various Muslim extremist groups in sécularistes have rejected the Chinese in the , allowing sécularistes of them to resume their economic role amidst increasingly sécularistes . 
But the personal safety that they want and that the Malaysian Ethnic Chinese are going to get still remain as distant as ever . 
Indeed , it is highly unlikely that Indonesia would produce a leader on whom they could count in the same way that the Chinese in Malaysia are now counting on Prime Minister Mahathir .

Football and philosophy
Gooooal!!!
Divine serenity , or , depending on which team ours or theirs . 
How can the trajectory of a ball be responsible for either happiness or pain?
I have spent weeks sitting in front of my television watching the World Cup.
My wife threatens to divorce me and to take other disciplinary action . 
What is the source of this attraction, of this magic?
The world of the game is our perennial garden of Eden.
You can abandon our reality at any time for freedom , innocence and the happiness of game . 
Football and the Garden of Eden?
What do they have in common?
It defines a sphere sacred freedom and order of innocence, spirituality and justice in our world day of chaos, slave-trading, unfair and punishing.
The board , the tennis , the football ground in their area , we feel free , because ground these places we decide the rules without being ground to the iron laws of the outside world . 
You feel innocent , too , because the game is also a world of innocence a Garden of Eden before the fall . 
Here we can be childish and selfish , we can satisfy our need for success , power and dominion , and all this without any guilt . 
In the game world, freedom is generated, paradoxically, by the restrictions.
In , the basic rule is simple the ball should move from the central point towards the of one of the two cages . 
If the balloon was heading directly from the central point to a cage, his path would be, or would appear to be strictly defined and all would be pretty boring.
To create a degree of freedom , the regulation occurs in way the ball managed to regulation the trip . 
First , two teams of 11 players are placed on the ground with the task of placing the ball into one cage the goals . 
Then , they are asked to put the ball in the goals of the other side . 
Thanks to 22 players with their own skills and their own , thanks to various movements of confrontation and cooperation , the number of possible combination is almost infinite . 
After this, there is just one more factor to create a true world of happy surprises, freedom and happiness: the ball.
Balls are the most important in the creation of freedom in our lives . 
A ball, it is freedom personified.
It could bounce back in any direction.
It seems to be equipped with a of its own . 
It is an , and yet , it seems to be free . 
With the introduction of an element of chance and unpredictability into the game , the ball changes a bitter , fight to earth human into épiphanie of spirituality and freedom . 
According to his quick , chance and men will interact , dance , and do somersaults with one another . 
The ball errupts from here , from there , full of carefree irresponsibility , between the desire of men and chance , freedom and restriction , success and failure , hope and despair , to bounce back in the world of hope .
He has his own universe.
He moves into the sphere of the sacred.
But the sacred does not exist without the secular.
The ground is marked and delimited from its world . 
The experience and sacred ceremony would be incomplete if the tension between the ground and the gallery did not exist . 
The ground and the freedom of the game must be ground opposition with the howling hurlante in darkness ground gallery , the red burning torches and the sudden travelling ground joyous ecstasy and infernal misery 
In our daily lives , reason and passions . 
football as in other sports separates these two areas and football them . 
All the passion , emotions and instincts are forced onto viewers passion 
They rage and burst out , storm around and explode , to attain catharsis finally the end if their team wins or go through hell if their team loses . 
Meanwhile, they are watching, and the experience of freedom platonic or apollonienne game taking place on the ground.
Yes, the players move in a world of spirituality.
They act according to clear, sacred rules.
When they play, they are supposed to act in rational beings, who leaves behind the passions and emotions, fears and the wishes of their intimate life.
They move in a world of morality and pure justice.
The world of the player is a world full of justice and complete fairness; perfect equality in opportunity, that we never usualy get.
Even the meaning of the wind is controlled . 
The two teams change hand at half time . 
Where and when do we see the privileged and need poor side in the real world ? 
The players, too, are not supposed to depart from the rules.
If they do, they are punished, and if they do it again, they are ejected from the game
They are excluded from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappear into the underworld chill of the changing room . 
The definitive expulsion from Paradise only occurs the holiness of the game has been desecrated , if the fate has been broken with the players robbed of their angelic role and embarking on a fight on the ground , with a cheating referee , with a public understanding that a match was arranged , with spectators invading the pitch .
Such events affect the public and the community for public long time . 
It is a bitter to realize the fragility of our world of freedom , spirituality , dignity , and then waking up again as we do when the winner of the World Cup will be known in our world , nothing less than hostile .

Egypt needs a president, not a pharaoh
A heated debate on the current political reforms is shaking up Egypt.
Stemming from all opposition parties and society groups , it focuses on a request to amend society 1971 Constitution and end the state of emergency society in 1981 1981après Sadat's assassination . 
These demands are nothing new . 
President Mubarak and the National Democratic Party have been stonewalling since the mid 1980s . 
But, given the alarming turn of events in Egypt, in the region and beyond, the need for reform is now a compelling character.
The 76 years of President Mubarak and his health is a source of concern.
Rumours about this have been run for years , but they were only confirmed officially run November 2003 , when it was no longer possible run hide the situation . 
While he addressed parliament, Mubarak fainted before the eyes of millions of viewers.
Although he returned an hour to finish his speech , the Egyptians started demanding more transparency , regarding the president's health as well as the functioning of the State .
At the same , the deteriorating economic situation , high unemployment and widespread corruption have led to part of youth . 
More than half of the of people was born under the presidency of Mubarak . 
According to a recent UN report, half of young people between 15 and 30 years old dream of emigrate to Europe, North America and Australia.
Every week , reports talk about Egyptians drowning in the Mediterranean while trying to illegally cross into Europe . 
A few weeks , several young people died of suffocation they were returned to Egypt in freight trucks crossing the Libyan desert .
This case has led to protests that have forced the authorities to stop, questioned and bring to justice the Egyptian police officers responsible for the facts.
The situation in the region and in the world has made the opposition more daring, not only to demand reforms, but also to amend the articles of the constitution relating to the presidency.
Rumours are persistent, Mubarak, who has already been re-elected four times, would seek to obtain a sixth term or to establish a hereditary Republic. "he prepares his son Gamal, 41 years, successor to the image of the Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar.
The battle cry of the opposition is no , no to the re election of Mubarak no to Gamal to succeed him .
Many Egyptians have nothing against Gamal Mubarak as such, but they are mortified at the idea that, after being subjected to the father for 24 years, they risk being inflicted by the son for the same length.
Out of 211 articles of the current constitution date to October 1971 , 30 relate to the presidency date 
The appointment of the president by a two thirds majority of appointment People's Assembly is then ratified by a popular plebiscite in appointment one can only answer yes or no . 
The presidential term of six years, obtained by simple majority, is renewable indefinitely in the same way.
The of these procedures truly with the extent of presidential power . 
The president is both head of state and commander-in-chief, will chair the Supreme Council of the judiciary, police and council of ministers. It is at its discretion name and withdrawing one or several deputies.
He appoints the prime minister and key ministers and approves the appointment of other ministers, some ambassadors and some senior civil servants.
He can call for general elections, declare war, declare emergency rule and enact decrees that have the force of law.
There is not one balance of power.
An article states that the president can be impeached for high treason or any other criminal act if a motion submitted by at least one third of the members of the People's Assembly is approved by two thirds of them . 
The president is suspended from duty and replaced by the Vice President until the conclusion of the process .
But Mubarak has never promulgated the law needed to implement this article or even appointed a vice-president, despite repeated requests from all sides.
This has resulted in a de facto "imperial presidency" with Mubarak in place of the pharaoh.
No other head of state in modern history has ever had so much power in his hands.
In Egypt , he is more readily compared to Leonid Brezhnev , who presided over two decades of stagnation and decline of the Soviet Union . 
Similarly, the position of Egypt as a regional power has collapsed under Mubarak.
On the economic front, the flow of foreign investments has plummeted from 3 billion per year in the mid-1990s to some ridiculous 300 million in 2003.
The demands for reform now focus on the of the president by universal suffrage with at least two candidates and the prohibition of more than two consecutive terms . 
But he should also reduce power wherever they are abusive and create effective mechanisms power all government officials without exception to be accountable for power actions . 
If Mubarak and his government are doing nothing to support that the constitutional amendments are adopted , more and more Egyptians will from regime and risk their lives to seek refuge elsewhere .

Bush should no longer play in the Gulf
President Bush urged Americans not to "play politics" in this period of terrible national disaster.
But, to ask the awkward questions to the leaders of our nation is exactly what is democracy, when the government's response to Hurricane Katrina is widely regarded as "a disgrace."
Katrina announced its arrival at least two days in advance, but the authorities delayed launching an evacuation order.
No way of transport was available for those who had no way or car ; the reception and care for the way were inadequate , the necessary forces were not in way to deliver the supplies that were absolutely essential or to maintain way , and the number of boats , helicopters and way equipment needed to rescue those who were way was far enough . 
Hampered by the National Guard , of whom 40 are in Iraq , the speed mobilisation military to the most affected areas has been unusually slow . 
For four days, there was simply no clear central control and orders.
Consequently, numerous victims have suffered and died.
This is largely attributable to the policies of the Bush administration, which has effectively been eroded the capabilities of the Federal Emergency Management (Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA), government agency whose primary mission is to manage the disasters.
Obsessed by the war against terrorism and by the ideology of privatization of government functions , the administration has systematically undermined the ability of FEMA to avoid disasters in the long term or at least soften the blows when prevention is still possible .
FEMA has been restricted and demoted from its Cabinet , before being placed under the auspices of the Department of National Security . 
Its mission of planning and preparation for disasters has been completely sidelined, for the benefit of the fight against terrorists.
Its leaders have no experience in disaster management.
The previous precedent was one of Bush's Texas policies cronies , precedent the skills director's include policies task of precedent commissioner and of judges for policies service Arabian precedent Association , where he was forced policies resign for precedent of supervision . 
Since 2001, billions of dollars have been transfered from aid to disaster management to national security and the war in Iraq.
The key for disaster relief have seen their budget melt like snow in the sun and the federal funds have been cut in half . 
The budget of the Army Corps of Engineers for the of levees in New Orleans was looted , particularly the funds specifically allocated to urban flood control in southwest Louisiana . 
Prevention measures aimed at protecting the population and properties have not been implemented , despite the conclusions of FEMA as far back as 2001 , specifying that a major hurricane that hit New Orleans was one of the three most probable and most catastrophic disasters which could hit this country . 
Convinced that the FEMA was a disproportionate social program that the government's job is not to provide services , the first director of the FEMA of Bush has set up the requirements of supply outside under a major effort of privatisation .
This phenomenon has led to a brain drain because many of the FEMA are geared to the drain sector . 
The privatisation has also put the États and the poorest communities privatisation a particularly vulnerable . 
À measure that funding is tarissaient and that the federal programmes were called in the hands of private companies to higher fares, only the États and communities, the richest and politically important had the means to claim the rare federal benefits to pay for services.
For example , Florida which has 16 more votes than Louisiana where the governor is the President's brother has received the funding required to protect its wetlands .
In contrast , Louisiana , which has more with his incredible poverty rate of 24 , has seen in 2004 , denied his request to fund to prevent floods . 
Given that the ability of Louisiana to protect itself was weakened and that the management of disaster was undermined , the inadequate response of the government and destruction unnecessary were almost inevitable . And the poor are those who paid the price . 
But the reasons for the failure of this administration surpass the diversion of resources and chronic voluntary schemes to protect people from disasters . 
Despite scientific evidence proving that the intensity and increasing frequency of hurricanes are linked to climate change , the Bush administration rejects any participation in international programmes aimed at climate . 
Rather than enforce the ban on wetlands instituted by previous administrations , the Bush chose to ignore it . 
The erosion caused by urban development has taken approximately 30 kilometers of the Gulf of Mexico compared to 1965 , hurricanes are capable of concentrating their force causing increasingly faster stronger wind waves .
, the reduction of wetlands was threatening levees in New Orleans , built on the principle that 60 to 80 km of protective wetlands would play the role of a buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico .
Despite all the major studies showing that a rehabilitation programme of the coast of large scale and construction of dams highest was necessary to protect New Orleans, the government has allowed the federal agencies to stop protecting 8,000 hectares of swamps, the promoters to drain hundreds of acres and in 2004 has cut more than 80% funding to keep the waters of Lake Pontchartrain.
New Orleans has sounded the alarm bells for America.
The ideologies of privatisation , which prevent effective and allow privatisation privileged to save their skin while poor people must privatisation up onto their roofs , must now be called into privatisation . 
This disaster is a reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens, and it is imperative that the Americans are asking accounts.
The officials who have not done their work must be sent , and the elected representatives whose policies have aggravated the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina dismissed . 
We owe it to the deaths and the survivors .

The Comandante' autumn
Only Gabriel Garcia marques would find the right words to describe the expectations marques the death of Fidel Castro . 
His novel , The Autumn of the Patriarch , perfectly captures the moral poverty , the political paralysis , and the fierce boredom that buried a society awaiting the death of a longtime way . 
The departure from power of Commandante Fidel is only a matter of biology , and the rare photographs of him which have appeared since he fell ill last year clearly show nature at work . 
When the end comes , the change in Cuba may well be as large as any of the that greeted the end of the great dictators of the last century . 
Stalin , Franco Tito , Mao their ways and are all similar . 
The way they left the scene has often been very different , however , and these differences model the companies for years and decades after their death . 
Take the example of the Soviet Union.
On March 9 , 1953 , from the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea , everything stopped , in Warsaw , Budapest , Prague and East Berlin . 
In À , Mao Zedong himself bowed in of a huge À of Joseph Stalin . 
Huge crowds in mourning, bereaved, almost hysterical, poured out in the vast empire which Stalin had ruled.
And yet , in a few days , the word Stalinism was removed from a new Soviet dictionary and Three years later , my grandfather , Nikita Khrushchev , denounced Stalin's cult of personality in his famous secret speech in the 20th congress of the Communist Party . 
The thaw that followed was short lived , but for the first time in the Soviet history the possibility of change had been considered a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized en en1985 . 
The death of Marshal Tito Josip Broz provoked the reappearance of another kind.
For decades, her reign had imposed a false sense of unity on Yugoslavia.
After his death in 1980, this artificial state began to disintegrate, culminating with the genocidal wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo in the 1990s.
But not all dictatorship end up in disintegration and chaos . 
The death of Mao allowed the return from exile of Deng Xiaoping , who had been cloud . 
Deng quickly started to throw the heirs of the Gang of Four , and in some years ago , opened the Chinese economy , feeding a capitalist revolution that transformed China more completely , and with more success that the socialist revolution of Mao had never done . 
Of course, the Communist party remains in power, and Mao's portrait is still on the Tiananmen Square.
But both are mere relics of ideas and ideals that in have been consigned to the dustbin of history . 
Spain also has escaped violent dissolution when the fascist dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco collapsed on his death.
The old dictator can claim credit for this success, since by restoring the monarchy of King Juan Carlos just before dying, he gave Spain a foundation upon which to rebuild.
Franco was far from imagining that Juan Carlos would , with the of an intelligent and young bureaucrat during the time Era named Adolfo Suarez , build the modern and democratic Spain of today . 
It is no coincidence that the communist countries were and still are generally run by geriatrics , and the democracies by younger men and women . 
This difference is important.
Old leaders can successfully preside over countries where everything is working peacefully , and which do not require further examination of their policies and their targets . 
There are exceptions to this rule , of course Churchill , Adenauer , Deng , Reagan but États count on fortune give them an exceptional leader . 
Younger people are more likely to be able to manage the people changes of difficult times . 
Political competition means that all politicians, whatever their age, have to stay alert, to anticipate problems, and to remain open to new ideas.
Nobody can remain well placed to his high office to wait and do nothing that the death or boredom should take.
The one party systems , dictatorships playing on the charisma of one man or a mixture of both , as in Tito's Yugoslavia , are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and governments' inertia . 
That will become Cuba after the death of Fidel?
Many observers describe Raúl Castro , the youngest brother of Fidel and his designated successor , as a pragmatist the practical practice . 
When the Soviet largesse have continued in the early 1990s , Raúl has largesse that the regime survival depended on economic reforms and largesse lobbied to allow the private agricultural markets are réouverts largesse boost production and avoid a possible famine . 
However , he is the same man who , as the head of the internal security apparatus of Cuba , has represented for many years the iron fist of the regime , who is directly responsible for the imprisonment , often torture , of thousands of dissidents .
So perhaps the best that one can hope for is a experience style in which is quickly stifled by the nervous old guard of the regime . 
In addition , with support from oil rich allies like Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez and with the recent discovery of oil reserves off the Cuban coast , the of reforms could become less urgent . 
In this case, Raúl could try to cling firmly to the fossilized system he helped create and maintain with such brutality.
But Raul Castro is himself an old man , we can only hope that a Deng or , better yet , a Suarez , will emerge from the wreckage of Castro . 
That said , for now , the youngest Communist Cubain representatives , Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said , remain ideological hardliners whom many Cubans los Taliban .
If they take over the power and keep their finger on the trigger, Cuba could have to face a new and very long biology lesson.

The ECB is now an anchor in Europe . 
The time had come for the European Central Bank to build a reputation.
Barely a month after the rejection of the constitutional treaty of the European Union in France and Holland , the recent European Union summit in Brussels ended in a hargneuse orgy of national egoisms , without any agreement reached on the EU budget . 
With Europe in turmoil , the ECB should present itself as anchors stabilising . 
Europe suffers from a profound crisis of confidence which is hampering its economic recovery.
Consumers , lacking confidence capacity their political leaders' to resolve these multiple problems , save capacity the bad days they believe to be very near , capacity businessmen are reluctant to invest because they do not capacity government implement the necessary economic reforms . 
the shameful summit in Brussels shows , this lack of confidence in the political leadership of the EU is quite justified .
Instead of acting effectively and in a constructive on Europe's problems the reform of the state systems for expensive medical care for a better overall competitiveness the European political leaders are hiding behind false arguments on the models Anglo Saxon ultra liberals budget rebate , the British and high interest rates , as if the economic weaknesses were due to the mistakes of the ECB . 
To undermine the independence of the ECB , European finance ministers are seek to weight in on decisions of the bank's decision making . 
Jean Claude Juncker , Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup , testifying before the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the Parliament of the European Union , said that euro zone finance ministers needed to be more forceful in the expression of their positions vis à vis the ECB talks He called for open and frank between the ministers of the Eurogroup and the ECB . 
Who needs these talks?
By common the Euro zone finance ministers want to talk about lowering interest rates , which will not help economic recovery in Europe . 
The ECB has already extended the period of monetary stability through Europe with interest rates at their lowest in years.
Can we really believe that consumers refuse to spend that business people put off their investments until the next decrease of interest rates ?
To paraphrase Mr Keynes , one cannot force a donkey that isn't thirsty to lust 
"The last thing Europe needs now is a reduction in interest rates," said a member will affect the ECB governing council in a candid assessment of the current situation. Capitulate under external pressure was no good definition of a "stabilising" anchor.
The Euro would collapse and the ECB would lose all credibility as a central bank.
In addition , the chief economist of the ECB , Otmar Issing , predicts that interest rates will go up longterm , rather than fall , inflation expectations are rising .
Thus, reducing interest rates would not only an error, it would be especially madness.
But the ECB will not reduce its rates , even although it argues that this would be possible to keep the political wolves at bay .
The ECB continues, and it proves to European citizens that there is at least a European institution in which they can trust.
This is extremely important.
History has shown that political policies leads to inflation , which in turn increases policies turmoil . 
The Europeans can bet their last euro on the ECB it won't let its young common currency be havoc by inflation because political leaders who have failed in their task now fear losing their burden . 
Indeed , the courage shown by the ECB by remaining true to its principles should serve as a model for future European politicians . 
When they would have understood that we cannot force the BCE bank cuts interest rates in a unnecessary and destructive , European bank will then be the courage to govern , which bank after all , is why they were elected .

The dash to the succession of Arafat 
To understand what the Palestinian cause will look like without Yasser Arafat , consider the various securities that it currently holds . 
Arafat is president of the PLO executive committee , president of the Palestinian National Authority , commander in chief of the Palestinian forces and leader of the Fatah movement . 
The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations for independence and the desire to become a state.
It is the highest political body for all Palestinians, both those living in Palestine as refugees as well as other Palestinians in the diaspora.
Arafat's successor will have to juggle between negotiations with Israel , which will require concessions on the right of return of refugees to Palestine , and the aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who wish to return to the homes from which they were expelled during the wars of 1948 and 1967 . 
Arafat's successor to the presidency of the Palestinian National Authority will be linked by the Oslo Accords, which created an interim government, currently led by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei, which is responsible for the daily lives of Palestinians living in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
Palestinians must decide if the president of the PNA will occupy a solid position or one that is merely symbolic , as is the case now . 
The second option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister , fulfilling the wishes of many Palestinians and many others . 
The position of the commander of Palestinian forces supposedly place the various military, Palestinian security and intelligence units in the hands of one leader, who is supposed to uphold the law.
But those forces are now in complete of confusion , the majority of the Palestinian uniformed security uniform must be reorganized after four years of intensive efforts by Israel to crush them . 
The major factor of the internal security lies in the local paramilitary units.
These units , most of which are not controlled by the central direction of the ANP , are more loyal to the leaders of basis and PNA officers in uniform . 
Local leaders of Fatah such Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades .
Barghouti had advocated and tried to implement internal elections within Fatah when the Israelis detained him.
As a street elected of presidency students Bir Zeit University street he gained presidency by being chosen by his street . 
When trial Oslo began , he refused to trial any official position with the Palestinian Authority , choosing trial to remain close to the local Fatah . 
Whoever will take the place of Arafat must ensure that these troops are satisfied with their status , their requirements , that their leaders are respected .
Indeed , the struggle for power , which will be held in the post Arafat era , will centrera ultimately on the Al Fatah , the hub of the PLO . 
A World Assembly chooses the revolutionary council of Fatah, which is composed of 100 members and where to turn a central committee of 20 states, in which will focus most of the struggle for power.
Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary street , or even on holding the sixth street assembly which will be the first since 1988 . 
The events of recent months show that the Martyrs' Brigades of Al Asqa forced even Arafat to take their demands into . 
Most of the struggle for power will take place While the nationalist camp , however we must not forget the Islamist camp run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad . 
Although it is unlikely that Islamists will interfere in the post Arafat power struggle , they will not sit idly if the new leader moves in the wrong direction . 
Of course, the new leader must reach an agreement with the Islamists on the ground rules, both at home and toward Israel.
Without this agreement and if the new leader is hard against the Islamists, a violent civil war could break out.
More importantly, to consolidate his supremacy, the next Palestinian leader will have to make tough decisions and get concrete results quickly.
The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister , who resigned in large part because of his inability to bring improvements to his people especially regard personal and collective security , respect and the end of the mayhem that reigns in some Palestinian areas , remains fresh in the memory of the population . 
At the same , the freeze of settlement activities , the release of Palestinian political freeze , including Marwan Barghouti , and the elimination of freeze of checkpoints between the Palestinian cities would revive a sense freeze hope , without which no Palestinian leader can negotiate freeze the world wants a peace agreement . 
The problem is that no Palestinian leader , no who he may be , can bring about these changes . 
They represent a direct challenge to occupants Israeli , neighboring Arab countries , and the international occupants , led by the United States .

The mystery of 2008 Moscow
Usually around this time, people are obsessed with what the new year is going to bring them.
In Russia , the real uncertainty 2008 , not 2007 . 
Indeed , Russian policy can today distilled into a single topic President Vladimir Putin today on as presidency after 2008 , despite his today assertions to the ? 
And if he is giving way, who shall he train to succeed him?
Will his be of one of the of the Kremlin ? 
Or will he choose a "foreigner"?
À less than Putin retains its position on the ultimate arbiter and decision-making skills the country, there are large risks that a fierce internal fighting is raging.
In an environment where power and ownership are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated ownership a transfer of total authority could lead ownership violent redistribution . 
Resolving these issues is vital for the Russian political elites anxious to preserve their current benefits and gain others .
Regarding the public, the vast majority seems resigned to accept any solution arranged by the power.
Some 45 of Russians believe that Putine will appoint her successor , and that this person will become the new president . 
Almost a quarter believe that the constitution should be amended so that Putin can have a third term.
One way or another, it is almost universally acknowledged that the transfer of universal authority is settled at the summit and endorsed at the ballot box.
The balance of forces in the legislature will be, too, determined by the Kremlin.
In recent years, the configuration of political parties and the law on the elections have been changed several times to adapt to the interests of the ruling elite.
Therefore, undesirable forces have no chance in the parliamentary elections next December.
Alienated Étrangers politics , ordinary Russians are indifferent to that Étrangers not affect them directly , and do not attempt to Étrangers accountable . 
They were not disturbed by the recent murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya, nor by the assassination of Andrei Kozlov, vice-president of the central bank, nor by the implications of the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko (a majority of respondents in a poll said that he had been killed by his "business partners.")
This alienation between the État and the people has a long tradition in Russia État just like public apathy . 
But these days, the apathy is cemented by improving living standards.
Thanks to the from oil and gas , Russians live better than they ever did in the communist era . 
We can argue that history has never seen such a large proportion of Russians having a decent standard of living.
As a result, people have become even more docile with a government that is more and more autocratic.
Of course , there are many reasons to complain , people do grumble , but they will not unite to oppose the status quo .
Marginal political groups and individuals who participate in protest are faced with individuals pressure , protest harassment , which makes for even individuals reasons for the public protest turn its back . 
As the election result is played in advance, it may be that many will simply not vote.
In fact, Russia today has almost no reason to actively build support.
Instead , public participation is seen an obstacle to the objectives pursued by the bureaucracy self sustaining and expanding control over lucrative assets .
If members of the Russian elite ever harboured modernizing ambitions , they have abandoned them , because without public participation , modernization is an illusion . 
À place, the Kremlin relies increasingly on the conservative, Soviet style, as the basis of its power, by the more advanced, entrepreneurs and better trained.
Stephen Jennings, president of the Council of Renaissance Capital, a group of investment which has a decade of experience in Russia, recently noted the "conflicting trends" of the country: the emergence of "middle class booming" next to a "highly centralized government, raising a new class of oligarchs to État and bureaucracy to the rapid growth."
The problem is that the best and brightest elements of Russia, which Jenning praises for "big management capabilities, professionalism, productivity and social and economic ambition" don't seem to regard as a concern their remoteness from political decision-making.
They may regret the economic policies of the Kremlin , but they accommodate the rampant corruption in Russia and its shameful in the indices of competitiveness , just as they accommodate the general erosion of democracy , the manipulation of the judicial system and the weak law enforcement . 
Just as their less advanced countrymen , they do not seek to demand accountability in government or to call for changes . 
For now, life is quite beautiful as it is.
Therefore , if the smooth transition of 2008 is threatened , or if there is a risk of destabilisation , it can only originate from conflict at the summit , and not in public . 
The optimists hope that one day the growing Russian middle class will take responsibility for the future of Russia and will demand a radical improvement in . 
But what will be able to trigger a passage from passive docility to active public participation ? 
If a prosperous leads to the political apathy, and bad policies lead to a decline of socioeconomic status, the Russians the best and brightest could be overtaken by populist forces.

The drugs must change of strategy.
Once again, Russia and Ukraine are victims of an illusion.
Since the end of communism in 1991 , the use of illegal drugs has increased dramatically in both countries and in many . 
They responded with draconian measures in line with the simplistic policy aimed at the complete elimination of drugs adopted by the UN.
These measures today contribute to the explosion of AIDS in many developing countries.
The UN conventions which govern the drugs policy against international level does not take into drugs policy discovery on level use and addiction drugs 
Most of these conventions were established well before the appearance of AIDS , which is spread mainly by the use of intravenous intraveineuses in the former Soviet countries and in many Asian countries . 
Thus, internationally, it is in Russia and Ukraine that AIDS is spreading the fastest.
The number of people infected has increased 18-fold during the past five years.
It is estimated that 1 . 5 million Russians and 400 000 Ukrainians are affected , and at least 85 of them are IV drug intraveineuses . 
In a misguided attempt to comply with UN conventions , the Russian and Ukrainian governments use the bulk of their drugs resources for repression . 
Drug users are victims of police abuse, and are rejected by the health services even for vital medical care.
And time , drugs continue to flood the market . 
In terms of drugs , the crackdown has never managed to eliminate the request . 
The repression doesn't takes into account neither the social and economic factors, nor the public health issues related to the use of banned substances.
Locking up the drug users is not a solution; in Russia, it is even easier to buy drugs inside prison than outside it.
In a climate of repression , drug users who escape arrest tend to be subject to discrimination , which does not encourage them to protect their health or that of the people they come in with . 
If the company offers no hope for addicts and shows no compassion towards them, drug addiction and the AIDS virus can only develop quickly.
Russia and Ukraine are not only to deal with the increase of intravenous drug use and the spread of AIDS.
If they continue this type of policy, Pakistan, Iran, China, the Central Asian countries and all the countries who are in the same situation will face the same disaster in terms of public health.
Many work around the world show that in the fight against work , action in the area of public health work the most effective way to reduce HIV infection and its work costs . 
The British medical journal Lancet estimates that the US would have saved at least 500 million if they had set up exchange programme exchange needles on a national level during the 1987 1995 period . 
A survey conducted at the international level indicates that HIV infections fell by 5 . 8 in the cities where there is a programme exchange needles , but it has increased 5 . 9 in the cities where there is not . 
There are study significant importance that highlight a correlation between the existence study a exchange needles programme and an increase study drug importance . 
Studies carried out in the USA, Australia and elsewhere show that if the number of drug addicts who benefit from treatment does not decrease, it is because the participants to the needle exchange programmes have easier access.
The UN agencies such as the Commission on drugs or the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (ONUDC, ex-PNUCID) have no mandate to prescribe a specific strategy to fight against drugs.
However , their narrow vision of the fight against drugs has a strong influence vision the policy and measures taken by the . 
Many governments , obsessed with respect of UN conventions , cannot or will respect take into account the negative effects of terms respect against drugs on fight health policy . 
In the 1990s, when AIDS has started to kill millions of people in Africa, contaminating more of a quarter of the population of some countries, the international institutions have hijacked the head.
For similar reasons , this disease epidemic will soon hit the countries of disease former Soviet Union , amongst . 
Have we learned nothing?
It is not too late ; policymakers at the national and international levels can still reconsider their strategy . 
Despite the UN conventions, some countries have adopted a more pragmatic approach to drugs and AIDS.
Consider that this is primarily a public health problem can combat much more effectively the AIDS epidemic.
The following measures will be able to prevent this.
· an anti-discrimination law to ensure the civil liberties and human rights of drug users and people affected by HIV.
acknowledge that the use of drugs is a public health problem and not of of the law or law enforcement and implement a policy that reflects this . 
Legalize needle exchange programmes and treatment by methadone and other alternatives . 
Establish national to reduce risky that are useful and accessible to all . This requires education , , , and . 
· both nationally and internationally, involve drug users and their supporters in the development of the policy on drugs.
To refuse to reconsider the goals of the fight against drugs the chosen strategies will only worsen the AIDS epidemic contribute to the death of millions of vulnerable people .

The abandonment of the Lisbon resolutions.
Upon taking inauguration as president of the European Commission , Durao Barroso former inauguration minister of Portugal will have to urgently focus on inauguration order and refocusing the economic policies of the inauguration Union . 
The thickest issue that awaits is resolutions Lisbon , an ambitious programme approved in 2000 resolutions the Heads of État and Government of the European Union in resolutions to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic resolutions by 2010 . 
The primary economic fields are addressed innovation and entrepreneurship , reform of social systems and social inclusion , skills and employment , gender equality at work , the liberalisation of labour and markets as goods as sustainable development . 
It is certain that these are valeureuses ambitions , but part to the sphere of valeureuses political decisions . 
In , according to European treaties , the Union has no authority to implement legislative policy in these areas , nor the power to enforce it . 
However, the Council of Europe, encouraged by the European Commission, has invented a new political approach - called "open coordination" - to be able to affect these areas.
Open coordination involves the determination of common aims at the EU level , voluntary compliance on the of the États states and internal control of the in the Council of Europe . 
Evidently Évidemment open coordination has failed to keep its promises . 
The illusion that the Council of Europe can somehow Sommer growth and productivity has provided a distraction to the national politicians who do not want to promotion at national level of unpopular decisions.
So I suggested to Mr . Barroso , as a first , to get rid of the Lisbon . 
This is the only thing to do to make clear that national responsibilities remain in the hands of national politicians on economic performance.
This leads me to the macro-economic coordination at the EU level.
The Maastricht Treaty was considering a simplified policy framework for the economic and monetary union.
Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank , while tax policy remains the responsibility of the États states . 
National governments were subject to a dual constraint , according to the excessive deficit procedure aimed at preventing fiscal deficits of more than 3 of GDP and budget deficits of more than 60 of GDP or at least in value of this . 
Subsequently , the stability and growth pact added an additional criterion , in the medium term , so that national budgets are almost balanced .
It was , essentially , to prevent reckless fiscal policies after the launch of the euro , while leaving enough space for cyclical swings of deficits limit than 3 . 
The credibility of this package of measures was badly damaged by the public controversy in November 2003 between the Commission and the Ecofin Council on the application of the procedure for control of excessive budget deficits in France and Germany.
What does not mean that it must be abandoned.
Instead , a common external constraints on the behaviour of stimulus is necessary to safeguard together against a behaviour up of public debt not viable , which could behaviour financial stability and inflation across the European Union an behaviour risk by the impact of aging populations on pension behaviour . 
Such a constraint also offers an anchor for the national decision making in the États whose political systems are less strengthened . 
But the system must be reviewed.
I will not listen to those who defend the exclusion of investments in fiscal deficits: it would only offer a new incentive for creative accounting and an accumulation of unsustainable debts.
Instead , we emphasis focus on viability debt rather than emphasis annual deficits . 
The debt criterion , for example , could be accompanied by a limitation on the trend toward the increasing rate of public spending , which would be held below the rate of nominal GDP .
The power of the Commission to start the movement when there is risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened unless , of course , the Commission never forget that the monitoring of national policies is a task that requires a political sense and not can be left in the hands of managers and lawyers .
Finally , we must make European integration the main priority so that the Union has at its disposal a powerful legal instrument to force open markets and increase competition .
The best therapy for boosting growth must be both direct , by increasing competitive pressure , and indirect , outbreak triggering measures for flexible policies on employment , social welfare , and education . 
This is a long haul . 
State subsidies benefiting companies in a slowdown remain ambiguous , common laws designed to ensure the free movement of goods services are not fully respected by the member states ; public markets energy are the best examples .
In Moreover , most of the service markets trade securities , the distribution of wholesale and retail , services to businesses and local public services remain protected from competition and regulation of free trade .
The evidence is there to show that these distortions of the services market , which represents two thirds of GDP are responsible for most of the lack of productivity that affects the EU compared to the United 
In recent years , the Council of Europe has not been paying enough attention to these tasks , which imply a total and never ending commitment from the Member States to transpose and implement EU directives . 
Too often, the commission has favored the introduction of new legislation and the creation of new spending programmes to the management of what is already in place.
So , Mr Barroso should forget the flight of the Lisbon resolutions and concentrate instead on the implementation of the single market and put in the fiscal policies of states . 
We must allow local governments to take responsibility for the economic performance of their country.

Emotional civilizations 
Throughout the so-called "war against terrorism", the notion of "clash of civilisations" between Islam and the West has often been excluded as politically incorrect and intellectually obtuse.
The most common interpretation in place is that the world has entered a new era of a conflict "inside" of a civilization, namely Islam, with the Muslim fundamentalists in war against the moderates as much as against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such analysis was clear, ambitious and easily summed up: democratization.
If the lack of democracy in the Islamic world were the problem , bringing democracy to the wider Middle East would be the solution , and it was the historic duty of the USA , as the most powerful and moral nation , to make this necessary change . 
The status quo was untenable.
Getting democracy in place, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Today Iraq is perhaps at the edge of a civil war between Sunnis and Shia . 
Iran , governed by a new and more radical , is moving ineluctably toward developing nuclear capability . 
A free election procedure brought Hamas to power in Palestine , and election procedure episode drawings humoristiques Danish newspapers illustrated election procedure combustible fuel of relations between Islam and the election procedure 
All these developments pave the for new interpretations . 
Rather than a clash of civilizations , we could be faced with many levels of conflict , which interact in that increase global instability . 
Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.
There is a division within Islam , which , if the violence in division spreads to neighboring countries , could division regional destabilization . 
There is also a clash that should not be regarded as between Islam and the West , but between the secular and growing people . 
À a deeper and atavistic resurfacing , there is an À conflict between a culture resurfacing fear and a culture À humiliation . 
It would be a gross simplification to evoke, as some do, a clash between civilization and barbarity.
In reality , we are facing a gap that is broadening the role of religion , which stretches between the West with the role of the U . S . being a complicated and most the of the world the most notable being China , particularly the Islamic world . 
This gap reflects how religion defines an individual's identity within a society.
À a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere , we , À , have largely forgotten our religious violent and intolerant À and have difficulty understanding the role that religion can À in the daily lives of others . 
In certain aspects, "they" are our own past life and, in a combination of ignorance, prejudice and above all else, fear, "we" are afraid that "they" can define our future.
We live in a secular world , where freedom of expression can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery , while others see religion their ultimate purpose , if not their last hope .
They have tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, communism to capitalism.
Since all has failed, why not try God?
Globalisation may not have created these levels of conflict , but it has increased these by making them more visible and palpable . 
In our globalized era , we have lost the privilege , paradoxically , the virtue of ignorance .
We all see how others perceive and react , but without the historical and cultural basic foundation needed to decipher these responses . 
bed has created a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions bed ignorance . 
The emotional shock is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of the humiliation suffered by the peoples and nations who regard themselves as the main losers, the worst victims of an international system new and unfair.
From this , the Israeli Palestinian conflict is exemplary . 
It has become an obsession.
It's not that the Arabs and the Muslims are really concerned about the Palestinians.
Instead, the Islamic world has left the Palestinian without real support for decades.
In reality , for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unjust colonial , to represent their political unrest , and to embody the fact they see of ever becoming masters of their fate . 
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), the strength and resilience of Israel is a direct consequence of their own weakness, their divisions and their corruption.
The majority of Arabs may not support al Qaida , but they are not opposed to it with all their hearts .
In À place , the temptation is to treat Osama bin À as a kind of violent Robin Hood , whose À officially unforgivable , have helped to restore a sense À pride and dignity of the Arabs . 
That's where , perhaps , the true clash of civilizations is in the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim , and particularly Arab , culture of humiliation . 
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of such a wide emotional pit , acknowledging its existence is the first step to overcome it .
But it will be difficult, because to transcend the emotional clash of civilisations requires an opening to the "other" that none of the two sides is perhaps ready to consider.

Globalization and anti Americanism . 
Anti American feelings are developing everywhere in the . 
American Democrats argue that the policies of President Bush have damaged the attractiveness of America.
Republicans respond that America is doomed to be unloved because of its size and its association with globalisation.
According to them, anti-Americanism will persist because some view America as a threat for culture.
Personally , I think that these positions are lacking historical perspectives . 
Unlike the conventional wisdom , globalisation is not a factor in the standardization and Americanization of world cultures . 
Although the United States are the first lines of the information revolution, to develop the similarities of cultural and social behaviours (such as listening to the television or the use of the Internet) which are attributed to the Americanization, even if the correlation is not the causal relationship.
To understand why , imagine a country that introduced technology communication speedy speed in a world where America did not exist . 
One would expect important social and cultural changes as a importance of such modernisation . 
Of course , because of the existence of the United States and its presence at the vanguard of the revolution , there is a degree of Americanization , which is likely to diminish in the twenty first century , thanks to the penetration of modernisation of pace cultures . 
The historical evidence that globalization is not necessarily uniformity is in Japan, which has deliberately isolated from the world during the first wave of globalisation.
In the middle of the nineteenth century , Japan became the first Asian country to welcome and to engage with success with the world without losing its uniqueness . 
During the Meiji Restoration , Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a strong power rather than a victim of Western imperialism . 
He sent his youth study in Western societies . 
Its delegations went around the world in search of scientific, technological and industrial innovations.
In the political field , the reformers Meiji were very aware of the philosophy and American institutions , but they chose to turn to the German model that they found more appropriate to a country ruled by an emperor . 
The lesson Japan gives the rest of the world does not depend on just the fact that an Asian country can be competitive , that after a century and a half of globalisation , it remains possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture .
Above all, the image of an America as a factor homogenisation reflects an incorrect static vision of cultures.
Efforts to show local cultures as immutable often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than a description of reality.
As Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa said , those who defend cultural identities against globalization betray a restrictive attitude towards culture seen outside of any historical dimension .
Do we know of a culture that has remained unchanged throughout time?
To find these cultures , one must seek out meeting , primitive communities , magical religious , populated by people who . . . due to the their primitive , are increasingly vulnerable to exploitation and extermination . 
Fertile culture are in constant transition , borrowing from other cultures culture loans always being made by the United culture . 
Thus , a large number of countries have turned to Canada , rather than the US an example for their own constitution in the years following the end of the Cold War .
Globalization is also a double edged sword . 
In some areas, not only is the backlash felt against American cultural imports, but some efforts are being made to change American culture itself.
A majority of Americans are probably in with the death penalty nowadays , but the death penalty is seen as a blatant violation of human rights across Europe , in fact almost everywhere in the world . 
The American positions on the environment and climate change or GMOs raise the same criticism.
More subtly, the opening of America with immigration enriches as well as it turns American culture.
Finally, globalisation and the information revolution could strengthen rather than reduce cultural diversity.
Some French commentators express fears that the world of global marketing of the Internet that would fears no place for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different varieties of cheese . 
Instead , the internet enables dispersed consumers to gather in a way that encourages niche markets , even to the of hundreds of websites devoted exclusively to cheese . 
The Internet also allows people to establish package of more diverse political communities . 
The use of Welsh in Britain or Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than it was half a century ago.
Britain, Belgium and Spain, among other European countries have given greater powers to regions and local elected officials.
The worldwide age of world could well strengthen rather than weaken local cultures . 
The economic and social does product superficial similarities in logos T shirt or trademarks drinks , but there will always be a major product cultural diversity . 
The American culture dominates the world today, and contributes to the attractiveness of America, this is its soft power, in many areas, but not in all.
At the same , immigrants , ideas , and events outside American borders change American culture within the borders of the United States . 
While globalization develops technological capabilities , information technology allows us a wider participation in global communications , and because of this domination by the economy and by American culture could well be weakened . 
Less dominance could well mean a little less anxiety about Americanization , fewer protests against American arrogance and a decreased intensity in the aftermath of anti Americanism . 
The United States may have less control in the future, but could find itself living in a world more compatible with its basic principles of democracy, free enterprise, individual freedoms and human rights.

Why America must join the world
The September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington changed the United States profoundly by shifting the of its priorities on foreign policy . 
The Bush administration's new national security strategy, drawn up in September 2002, identifies the combination of terrorism, rogue states, and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat to America.
Most people agree with the new direction taken by American foreign people , but are contesting the method used . 
Is the threat is so great that America should act alone or should the United States have to act only with the support of international institutions , even if it hinders them ? 
The events in Iraq illustrate this debate, but the latter takes its inspiration from something deeper.
During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush said of America: "If we are an arrogant nation, they will as well, but if we are a nation humble, they will."
He was right, but unfortunately too many friends in America have seen his administration during the first eight months after his election, concerned with limited interests of America, focused on military power and disregarding the treaties, standards and multilateralism.
The peremptory announcement by the administration declaring that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was "dead" has led to a reaction from other countries which has cost the United States their headquarters to the Commission on Human Rights.
September the 11th allegedly has changed all that.
Congress has finally paid off the debts owed by America to the UN, and the president has concentrated his efforts on the formation of a coalition against terrorism.
But the rapid success of the war in Afghanistan has led some members of the administration and some commentators to functioning that unilateralism . columnist Charles Krauthammer , for example , advocates a new unilateralism in which America refuses to play the role of good international meek and pursues its own without any targets . 
The new unilateralism make a mistake by focusing too heavily on military unilateralism alone . 
It is true that America's military power , supported by a budget that equals those combination the eight most powerful country the United States combined , is essential to global stability and plays a major role in the response to terrorism . 
But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that getting removal of terrorism will take years of patient , unspectacular civil cooperation with other countries in areas such as the sharing of information , police work , the traceability of financial flows and cooperation between customs . 
The military success in Afghanistan has resolved the most simple of the problem . 
Al Qaeda maintains cells in about 15 countries.
Rather than proving the point of view of the unilateralism , the partial success in Afghanistan illustrates the continued unilateralism for cooperation . 
It was much easier to win the war in Iraq that winning the peace.
The problem for Americans of the 21st century is more important than ever of problems and forces beyond the control of the most powerful state. The attacks of September 11 demonstrated that the revolution and the globalisation of information has changed the world policy so that the Americans cannot meet all their international goals, acting alone.
The United States lack of international and national preconditions necessary to resolve conflicts in other companies and to monitor and control the cross-border transactions that threaten the Americans in their country.
In several of the current major problems , such as the global financial stability , drugs , the spread of disease or climate change , military power is ineffective . 
Indeed, his appeal may prove counterproductive.
America must instead use international coalition to deal with these threats and these common challenges coalition 
The spirit of cooperation from other countries depends in part on their own personal interest, but also the attractiveness of the American positions.
This is what I call soft power . 
This means that that other countries want what you want and need to use carrot and stick to get others to do what you want is less present . 
A strong power derives from the military and economic of a country . 
Flexible power is the product of the attraction represented by the culture, the ideals and the policies of a country.
Hard power will always be essential , but soft power will become increasingly important in the treatment of problems whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation . 
It is certain that no major country can afford to be strictly multilateralist , and the US must sometimes take the lead , was the case in Afghanistan .
But in Iraq, President Bush should have followed the example of his father and represented a broad international coalition.
Now , while his administration to the UN to seek a new resolution that will allow other countries to provide troops and resources to maintain peace and reconstruction in Iraq , he pays the price of his method of entry into war . 
Yes , multilateralism lateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict America's multilateralism of action , but that doesn't mean multilateralism it would not , as a general , be in multilateralism best interests . 
By integrating US policies into multilateral structures , the US can make its disproportionate power more legitimate and more acceptable . 
Even the Americans have good intentions are not immune to the famous warning of Lord Acton's phrase, which says that the power tends to be corrupt.
Learn to listen to others and to define the American interests more broadly to include the global interests will be crucial to the American soft power , and the vision that will have the rest of their dominant something healthy or not . 
The paradox of American power is that the most major power since Rome cannot attain a large number of its objectives unilaterally in the of worldwide to age . 
America must pay more attention to a flexible and to a multilateral cooperation . 
Such is the real lesson of September 11th.

Socialism or worldly division ? 
For the first time in our history , we have the knowledge , technology and wealth needed design conceive a different world . 
We have the means to "send poverty in the dustbin of history" (Make Poverty History).
Although we have the power to change the world, we do not take appropriate action.
In 2000 , many governments around the world have adopted the Millennium Development Goals under the of the UN aimed at halving poverty by 2015 . 
The international community does not , however , show the necessary political will to respond to these basic responsibility towards humanity , leading to a loss of confidence in policy by the people . 
If we do not act, our people will lose hope in the power of democracy and wallow in extremism, fundamentalism and violence.
In order to restore the confidence of people not only in policy but also in their own potential, our policies must ensure a responsible government and institutions operating responsibly in the interest of citizens.
The Socialist International , the largest political organization in the world , can , in that , join the citizens of the world around a new world programme designed to achieve these goals . 
Our first challenge will be the democratisation of globalisation . 
We must redefine globalisation the base and include the two thirds of humanity globalisation are currently base from the process , in terms globalisation reflect the base principles of inclusion , of cultural globalisation , and of sustainable base . 
How can we engage citizens in a democratic economic development the IMF and World Bank work on the principle of one dollar , one vote ?
Democracy cannot thrive in a world where capital and power are heavily concentrated in the hands of only a few , where the multinationals question the power of democratically elected representatives , where organized crime can afford to buy police , justice and politicians , where domination of the media is eroding fundamental freedoms . 
The democratization of globalisation will take time . 
However, we can speed the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration.
It calls for the creation of new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world , in China , the USA , India and the Arab world . 
To response to global problems , we must strengthen and democratize response international institutions , notably the United Nations . 
However, we must go beyond the reform of the Security Council and begin to create a global democratic architecture for globalisation to serve the people and not the markets.
Today, the main priority of the Socialists is to restore the balance between economic productivity and social justice.
While we have benefited from previous , notably the Nordic model , it remains difficult to achieve this balance in some countries . 
The capitalist markets caving to large commercial networks and the market economies turning into companies, governments and the unions are still more restricted in their freedom of action.
It has paralysed and divided our fellow citizens.
Citizens of developed countries are feeling increasingly objectified by consumerism and citizens of developing countries are struggling daily to survive .
In both cases, but in different ways, people feel poorer.
Surely we belong to different companies , but we must also deal with new forms companies inequality . 
The lack of labour standards in some parts of the world undermines the labour welfare of workers from other parts of the world . 
The migration the poor countries' masses has fueled feelings of fear and xenophobia in rich countries, particularly among the working class.
Similarly, free trade has sent back to back the farmers and employees of the service sector of the developed and developing countries.
Environmental issues have become one big blame game.
The developed countries fear the despoiling of vital resources if they are shared with developing countries, which in turn accuse rich countries to destroy the environment in their quest for profit.
To fill these divisions , we need to rethink the nature of jobs in this world economy ever more automated , décloisonnée and mobile . 
capital is globalised , core Labour standards must also be globalised .
The forced and child labour , as well as discrimination in hiring , must labour removed . 
We must equally democratize our own policies.
We must fight against exclusion in our political parties as we are fighting exclusion in our societies.
This means welcoming immigrants and minorities, creating greater opportunities for women and the disabled, and empowering the people through education and participation.
Empowering the people will give them the power to decide and the ability to decide.
At the Greek socialist party PASOK, which I lead, we have undertaken far-reaching reforms in this direction.
It is similar within the Socialist International, which seeks to create a world governed not by free markets, but by free people.

The Chinese hare and Indian tortoise.
India is everywhere was the subject of the World Economic Forum this year . 
In the western world, a great importance is attached to the achievements of China, so that those of India will come to mind only afterwards.
To emphatically underline the fact that political stability must triumph in the long term , Indians have covered all the bus with the flag India , the fastest emerging democracy in the world . 
The Indian media's intensive blitz a huge success . 
In À , speakers promoted the idea À even if China is speakers now rope over the À term , the race speakers the two Asian giants À play speakers or tails . 
At least for a few days , the emergence of India as a superpower , compared to China , was an fait accompli . 
But what is really going on in the race between the two economies that each relate to over a billion people?
Apparently, China has a comfortable lead over India.
Twenty-five years ago, at the dawn of the current globalisation movement, national production in India and China were roughly the same.
From this on , whatever the economic indicators , China is twice as rich as India . 
But the real difference is not so much that the best Chinese perform better than the best Indians . 
The Indian is made up of hard chargers . The bold of 22 billion made by Lakshmi Mittal to buy the French Arcelor demonstrates this . 
The real difference -- whether we admit it or not -- is the fact that the Chinese Communist government has managed to globalize a larger portion of the population that the democratic government of India has been able to.
However, it is impossible to say that wealth is evenly distributed in China.
It is only along the coast , where roughly a third of the Chinese , that people seem to really have entered into the 21st century . 
bulk of rural China remains very poor and 150 bulk rural Chinese do not have jobs . In the bulk , health and education are often reminiscent of the past bulk . 
However , the figures relating to exclusion due to the caste system are even worse in India .
It may be that only one in five from the globalised economy . 
For every employee in the call centers, there are countless Indians who are barely getting by.
While some 450 million Chinese are participating in the global economy, only 200 to 250 million Indians benefit.
More than anything else, this is the difference that separates the two economies.
What can India do to fill this gap?
Its biggest flaw is the lack of roads , bridges , ports and other infrastructure . À this level , the contrast with China is striking . 
If Indian products cannot find to the global market , how could India capture it ? 
Over the past five years, China has multiplied its road infrastructure by five.
Its 50 , 000 miles new roads were built to accommodate larger aircraft , miles were incompatible with lines atterissage Indian airports . 
This is not just a matter of money: cash flows to the Indian central bank that has mainly invested it in foreign treasury bonds with low yields.
The real problem is that the Chinese authoritarian system has no real opposition when it decides to level a shantytown in the road of a new airport . 
The Indian government , however , has neither the power nor will to trample over poor people to make the rich richer . 
Unfortunately, without infrastructure, the 800 million Indians who have not yet succeeded in life have little chance of doing so.
India will never be able to create enough jobs in the services sector alone, it must be able to become competitive in the manufacturing of low priced products.
Without a better network infrastructure, the majority of Indians will remain outside of globalisation.
Could the Indian economy in this succeed one day in outstripping the incurable of the Chinese ? 
Not necessarily . The areas in which India excels , essentially , offer potentially higher margins than industrial production . 
On this point, the Chinese, crippled by a largely inferior legal system, will struggle to compete.
Western companies have more confidence in Indian companies in terms of sensitive financial data or patents, than they have in China.
Foreign companies know that if they outsource their high technology projects to China , they might just as also publish their proprietary technical information directly on the Web ! 
India also has a much more developed financial system than China , an asset of increasing importance as these two economies evolve . 
The command and control of finance directed loans , as they are called by economists are effective finance it comes to building bridges . They are not finance effective when it comes to choosing which companies deserve to be finance . 
The challenge for the Indians and for other emerging economies Brazil , Russia and Mexico is to find new ways to develop their economic sectors that are doing well without choking strangle off . 
If India managed to catch up with China , it should include a greater number of its citizens in world by offering them better education , more efficient health care facilities and greater network infrastructure . 
It is only at this price that "India will be everywhere."

The countries in the black gold 
Poor Russia, though rich in oil.
It is so hard to find its place in the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously.
President Vladimir Putin, who may be hoping to raise the presidential debate at the summit in St Petersburg in July, has simmered an ambitious programme.
He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite érudites about education , infectious diseases and , to be érudites that nobody falls endorme , energy security . 
what have Putin's efforts gained him ?
Not much.
The Bush administration, represented by Vice-President Dick Cheney (but with the approval of the boss) recently accused Russia of reverting to its old manies "evil empire."
Putin hit back with the États-unis "Comrade Wolf" ready to melt on any nation showing signs of weakness.
How will Bush and Putin welcome each other at the meeting in St. Petersburg? The suspense remains.
The European , are still on the brink of nerves , so great is their fear of becoming once again caught the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine , which has drained their pipelines for several days earlier this year . 
For them , talk about energy security with Russia devolves into talk water with comrade crocodile . 
Obviously Évidemment if we want to be mean can always Évidemment to the absurdity of Russia's membership in a club Évidemment includes the giant economies giants the United States , Germany Évidemment Japan , Britain , France , Italy and to Évidemment lesser Canada . 
Why was the Chinese President Hu Jintao, whose country has the second largest economy (measured according to global prices), not given the Putin's place at the table?
After all, even with all its energy resources, and despite the current surge in gas and oil prices, the national product of Russia is little more than that of greater Los Angeles.
Perhaps Putin should stop submitting to all these criticism and go on the offensive . 
He could begin by pointing out to his smug democratic counterparts that he is probably more popular in Russia that none of them in their own country . 
In fact , it could probably honestly win an election tomorrow that said , no shall he day know this . 
There are few leaders who could say as much without laughing . 
Évidemment, the success of Putin in recent years to eliminate anything approaching a free press (and when a former KGB "eliminate" the Free Press is not that a style) has contributed to silence any open opposition.
That does not, however, Putin to enjoy a real popularity among a public who demand a leader able to attach the country without the sink.
Putin may also argue that the fiscal position of his country is far more solid than that of the other G8 members.
Certainly , the fact that Siberia has proved to be a giant oil wells most of whose income is absorbed by the government has been very helpful . 
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is also balancing the books of his country, for now.
But to be honest , oil is not . 
Most economists recommend the rich countries to replace their old, complicated fiscal codes by a simple and low tax, to a flat rate, and deplore the fact that so few countries have tried.
Putin has put in place this style of politics a few years ago , and the results were short of miracle . 
Of course , it is possible that the other G8 leaders are less excited about some Russian practices in the area resolution solving budget problems . 
Most of the countries of the G8 seem incapable of achieving the political consensus needed to take the necessary measures, such as increasing the retirement age or the significant reduction of indexing benefits on inflation.
Russia herself has virtually abandoned her pensioners having increased the amount of their income .
In fact, many elderly Russians are forced to ensure their survival by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to cultivate.
It is, if they survive: since the fall of the Berlin Wall, male life expectancy fell from 65 years to about 60 years.
It seems that the stress from the transition is the leading cause of death, even before the big killers in post-Communist Russia such as alcohol, crime, and AIDS.
Putin should say to his colleagues that they too could balance the intergenerational account of their country in affamant older?
In fact, Putin would probably be well advised not to insist on the achievements of his country.
Perhaps it is better to let the sink and hope for smiles in the family sink . 
Nevertheless , when Putin announces to his guests that they have to pay for Russia in to increase their own energy security , he will perhaps finally get the respect that he so longs for . 
The Économie of fear . 
The world economy seems to walk on water , brushing aside to shrug its shoulders of rising oil prices , the political paralysis in Europe , the unsustainable deficit of the United States , and record prices of real estate . 
Just because, as would have us believe the G8 leaders, investors are optimistic, confident in the direction in the world economy by their leaders?
Or are we governed by a disease of fear, fed by certain events, such as the recent terrorist attacks in London, which maintains the long-term interest rates low, masking a whole set of latent problems ?
The role of the extremely low adjusting for inflation long term interest rates , which hide a multitude of weaknesses in the world economy , is all too apparent .
The rise in property prices across the world is sustaining the call in many countries , and , according to a recent study of the International Monetary Fund , continually falling interest rates explain two thirds or more of the international rise in prices . 
Europe has less benefit, but its savings would have a worse if long-term interest rates were back to their average of 25 years ago.
Similarly, Latin America is experiencing a boom in recent years, despite the burden of debt and a mixed political reform.
The weak long term interest rates have allowed the region to manage its debt , while demand has helped drive up the price commodities its exports . 
Why did the in oil prices not bring the global economy on its knees , as was so often the case in the past ? 
Once again, the answer lies in low interest rates.
Usually, a sudden surge in oil prices translates soon as expectations of high inflation, followed by the rise in interest rates for all the dates.
But this time the Fed continues to push its short-term lending rates to control inflation and long-term interest rates that are far more important, have declined, as if by magic.
Indeed , America is the single biggest beneficiary of this cycle of low interest rates , where everyone borrows money as if soon there would be . 
Property owners, supported by rising housing prices, accumulate debts.
The federal government has thrown all fiscal prudence out the window.
The country as a whole absorbs an incredible three quarters of savings . 
But , as long as interest rates remain low and growth stays high , the Americans can laugh in the faces of those who predict that their are plant the fruits of their downfall . 
But if weak long term interest rates help so many economies walk on water , why are the rates so low and will this continue ? 
The situation is perhaps more fragile than many politicians would have us believe.
People perhaps feel less, not more secure, about their long-term future, either because they fear terrorism, a global pandemic or a set of severe financial crises.
I do not say that investors are hysterical, but simply that they have become a little more concerned about the long-term prospects.
Therefore , they rush on actions and mortgage securities that they perceive , rightly or wrongly actions as safe . 
We have no other convincing explanation.
It is certain that emerging markets have a unusual savings , reforming their reserves and improving their balance the budget, but nobody expects that to continue indefinitely.
Even the director of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, the Oracle of Delphi on interest rates, says about the current situation that it is a "mystery".
History suggests that the technology boom has not completely finished playing its role , and with U . S . productivity gains likely to radiate the world , raising growth everywhere . 
Usually , a rapid global growth is reflected in interest rates to rise for the long term , unless , of bottom deep down , people have become concerned . 
Let's suppose that investors are mindful of the possibilities of disaster in five to ten years.
(According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the risk is real.)
Suppose that investors believe that growth will probably remain strong, but maybe -- just maybe -- the situation will disintegrate.
In this case , it SetPoints quite possible for low interest rates to coexist with strong growth . 
It is true that some economists refer to the halcyon days of the 1950s and early 1960s , when Europe , the United States and Japan , prospered , but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth . 
This time representing the golden age of global growth , why time if we are experiencing the same phenomenon today ? 
What optimists forget is that these paradise like years represent equally a period of great . 
Many were those who feared the outbreak of World War III, and rightly so, according to many historians.
In that time , the specter of the book helped keep the loans at an affordable rates . 
Fortunately, the worst fears of investors have not come to pass, and we can only hope for the same thing today.
But if uncertainty is one of the main reasons that interest rates are low, then the G8 leaders should be less quick to congratulate themselves.
The fragility of collective psychology of investors is well known.
If they do one day calm down, interest rates will rise again and this could lead to ferment the latent imbalances in the world economy.

Political upheaval in Israel . 
The political world of Israel is going through the most impressive changes it has seen in 30 years.
The realignment of parties and leaders is particularly worthy , given the unexpected nature of recent date Ariel Sharon's decision to leave the Likud , the defeat of Shimon Peres as head of the Labour Party and the withdrawal of Labour members of the grand coalition government of Sharon . 
It is even more important to understand the significance of these changes for the future of Israel, of the region, and of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Basically, the Israeli political system is approaching the end of its second era.
From independence in 1948 1977 , the Labour Party dominated before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative , nationalist , and centrist parties allied in to the Likud bloc .
Since that , the two parties have succeeded in power in turn , sometimes in the of large coalitions and sometimes in partnership with smaller parties . 
On the surface, the rivalry between the parties played between "left" and "right," or "hawks" and "doves."
The truth, of course, is more complex.
Social classes and economic problems , in the shadow of classes persistent existential concerns , such as safety and classes continuity the État , have played a far lesser classes in Israel than in other societies . 
Here , the political divide could be defined as the clash of and . 
The first , Labour , believed that one day a force would take among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on reasonable grounds , while the latter , Likud , were more circumspect . 
For some years , the discussion was abstraction , a debate on what could happen in the abstraction , until the Oslo accords with the PLO in abstraction put the opposing views to the . 
Since 2000 , when the PLO leader Yasser Arafat rejected a political agreement and in its launched a five year years war , few remain . 
The intellectual realignment that resulted in Israel gave birth to a new national consensus.
It is now widely accepted that , as has always stressed the left , Israel must be prepared to withdraw from West Bank and Gaza and accept the existence of a Palestinian in exchange for real peace . 
But it is also widely accepted that , as the right has always said , of the partners is really ready to make peace . 
In this context, Sharon has won two landslide election victories as a radical applying a moderate policy, including a total withdrawal of the Gaza Strip.
That is where Israel is today , facing a political changes fueled by two new elements . 
First, Sharon has moved the Likud to the centre, and has made the hegemonic party, while destroying all the stereotypes on his personality, its methods and his vision of the world.
It is for the same reason that many members of the Likud party see Sharon, who helped found the party, as a traitor.
Sharon must now institutionalize his reforms, even if he needs another party to do it.
Secondly , the Labour Party has proved its bankruptcy , since its option viable leader was Shimon Peres , aged 82 years , and that his anachronistic optimism for the dove has become ridiculous . 
, due to low turnout in the elections , party primaries were won by Amir Peretz , an outsider a populist who wants to revive the Labour Party in highlighting the social economic problems , which means the withdrawal of the national unity coalition with Likud .
Although he will have to form a new party, Sharon will win the next election, which he has scheduled for February.
Peretz's strategy may attract voters from other left wing parties , but Labour will surely lose centrist voters and those for which the national security is a priority to benefit . 
Paradoxically , it will have a huge in principle , yet perhaps very modest in practice . 
When Sharon has strong public support for moderate policies , Israel will be more ready than ever to reach an agreement with the Palestinians , Syria , and the Arab world in general to find a diplomatic solution to global conflict .
However, given the chaos and the paralysis that increasingly characterise Palestinian politics, this opportunity will not be seized.
The growing power of Hamas, who speak openly of their strategy to increase acts of terrorism and destroy Israel, only strengthens this trend.
You can say the same of Syria , whose radical government is turns to a dangerously risky . 
Sharon could decide the partial withdrawal and the rings of West Bank settlements . 
But it is today widely acknowledged that such changes are a reaction to bleak prospects for real progress toward peace.
Hanging on to land to the challenges of a bargaining has much less sense if there is no one with whom to . 
Israel will , rather , continue to give priority to its own security , strengthening its defences against terrorism and consolidating its control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to reclaim as part of a possible diplomatic agreement . 
As a secondary consequence of this strategy, coupled with Palestinian attacks, international sympathy has only grown towards Israel.
This phenomenon could persist if the current political realignment that has occurred, enabling Sharon to win its programme of the centre and even the moderate left.
Nothing is assured, of course.
Benjamin Netanyahu, who remains popular, may well become a powerful rival to his right, and Peretz may well make the Labour Party a strong contender to his left.
Nevertheless , the national consensus has changed , shaking convictions about Israeli policies . 
The February elections will put these certainties to their toughest test in decades .

Ensure the future of the Evian Summit.
The paradox of our time is that the world's richest countries have the power to do good, but they seem to feel obliged to miss all the opportunities in this direction.
The United States is a typical kind excellence a country that spends 450 billion per kind on its defence budget and spending only 12 billion kind year on development aid to poor countries . 
They can bomb Somalia , Afghanistan , and Iraq , but they seem ill equipped to regions these develop . 
Europe does not lie in a better position, as she is paralyzed by internal divisions and budget deficits.
At the G8 summit next week at Evian, France will have a chance to start anew.
For the billion people represented at the G8 summit, life is proceeding relatively well compared to that of the rest of the planet, with average incomes of $25,000 per person and a life expectancy of around 80 years.
For about three billion people in the world at present , including China , most of India and the East Asia , economic development continues relatively well , even if it has many ups and downs most recently , the shock of the outbreak Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic . 
Economic trends are also day in Brazil and Mexico . 
But for the remaining two billion, life is hopeless.
For around a billion of them, their survival is precarious.
Millions of people die each year from lacking access to medicines, food, clean drinking water and basic hygiene.
Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years and fall in many areas.
The G-8 could end the suffering of billions of the world's most impoverished people if it took realistic steps to solve their problems.
He doesn't do it, because he is not just greedy but also fearful.
He believes that world poverty is inevitable and too expensive to eradicate.
But it can solve the problems of the poorest with comparatively less effort and without significant negative impact on its own level of life . 
The most important problem areas concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, in the Andean region and Central Asia.
Other pockets of extreme poverty in China and India are on the way of improving thanks to rapid economic growth of these two giants.
But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa, in the Andes and Central Asia do not solved by themselves.
These regions are trapped in poverty.
Africa is by far the most affected.
The U . S . government believes that these countries can only blame themselves for their . 
But it is about the vantardise ignorant of a rich country that does not understand vantardise ignorant in the ground . 
Africa is trapped in poverty for deeply rooted reasons .
It suffers from endemic malaria , which resembles an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome that would last for centuries , not for a few months . 
It suffers from a climate prone to massive drought and the soil nutrients have been exhausted.
It suffers from the fact that most of its population lives in rural areas , without paved streets to reach the ports and to facilitate access to international trade . 
Apart from a West African countries, it is suffering from a serious shortage of energy (coal, oil and hydroelectric power).
The United States have never been grappling with problems of the scale of those occurring in Africa.
Ultimate irony , these problems can be solved , whatever the cost . 
This is where the G8 should intervene.
The only commitment that must take the G8 leaders at Evian is to follow their previous promises that have not been kept for years.
Over the past three years, world leaders have promised to take concrete measures to reduce global poverty by half by the year 2015, in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals.
But only small measures were taken . 
The United States have increased aid to 4 billion per year while they have also military spending to 150 billion a year and cut trillions of dollars in taxes . 
It is clear that America has the means to do more on a very large scale to help poor countries around the world, if only they would plan for it.
The G8 leaders should commit specifically to provide financial support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, to increase food productivity in Africa through a new green revolution, to ensure that all poor children can go to school and that all poor peoples of all countries have access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
The total cost of this problem would be markedly less than 1% of the annual income of rich countries.
For the first time in history , the rich are so rich the poor so poor that the rich could put an end to enormous suffering with little effort .
The summit in Evian would clarify the situation and whether the greed , ignorance and grandiloquence of war have completely shut the eyes of the USA and Europe and Japan will look within rather than outside .

Good reasons to slow population growth.
The global talks on demographic policies are disturbing.
On one side , claim that the growth of human threat threatens our environment and our prosperity . 
The land, water, energy and biodiversity all seem to have a stress more important than ever, and population growth appears to be responsible in large part.
The debate in rich countries mainly on households and small numbers of children that they have insufficient to take care of their aging parents.
Those who worry about population growth have the best arguments.
The questions which Europe, Japan and to a lesser extent the United States, along with some middle income countries, must face in terms of an aging population are manageable.
, the benefits of slower population growth outweigh the costs .
On the contrary , If the world populations continue to grow rapidly , the pressure on global resources will become more acute .
Governments should therefore refrain from putting in place pro rate policies , even where birth rates are low . 
The confusion of the public debate partly reflects various demographic trends in different parts of the world.
The most rapid population growth occurs in the poorest regions.
Poor people , particularly the agricultural populations , tend to have a greater number of children often up to six per woman and have the highest population growth rates .
Poor farmers rely on the children for standard firm and the safety of parents when they get old farmers 
Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning.
Finally , poor families lot many children as to insure themselves against high infant lot . 
the birth rate is very high in Africa , the United Nations Population Division predicts the doubling of the African population by 2050 , increasing from 900 million today to 1 . 8 billion .
people with rapid population growth are also young populations because people the large population of children in homes . 
In Africa, the average age today is 19 years and it is predicted that it will be around 28 years in 2050.
In Europe, the trends are reversed.
The United Nations predicts a decline in population, which will fall to around 630 million in 2050, compared to 725 million today.
With fewer children and a higher life expectancy , the population has risen sharply in these forecasts from 39 years in 2005 to 48 old in 2050 . 
For the whole world, the population is supposed to continue to grow by 2.5 billion between 2005 and 2050.
The full in the developing world: 1.3 billion extra in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, and the rest in Latin America and in other regions.
Increasing the global population by 2 . 5 billion human beings will increase pressure not only on the companies where the population growth is taking but also on the planet as a . 
Overall energy consumption is soaring , reflecting the combined effect of increased capita capita income and thus increasing energy consumption per capita people . 
The high consumption of energy is already changing change our climate . 
, the tensions created by the global population growth coupled with higher incomes lead to a rapid deforestation , the loss of fisheries , to soil degradation and loss of natural habitats and the extinction for a number of animal and plant species .
Population growth in developing regions, particularly in Africa, India and in other parts of Asia, must slow down.
Public policy can play an important role by improving the services of access to family planning for the people , extending the social systems of care , reducing infant mortality , thanks to investments in public health and improving education and access to employment for women . 
Part of the European public , noting the decline of declining European populations , wants to turn decline and promote the return to large families . 
This would be a mistake.
The defenders of accelerated demographic growth in Europe are worried about the lack of young manpower to ensure public pensions.
But this concern can be handled by greater savings by young and middle aged people preparing for their pensions and working beyond the age of 65 . 
These workers will gain greater benefits if they live in people with stable or slightly decreasing industries . 
Their direct expenditure on children's education will be expenditure important . 
They save on infrastructure investments such as new roads , power plants , schools and other public services .
They also benefit from less congested cities pressure fewer environmental environment through the campaign . 
The European economies will have less cost to take over the limit on greenhouse gases due to the energy consumption, which will lead to more effective control of climate change.
In short, the quality of life will improve with the decline in the European population in coming years.
There is nothing radical here to call for the slowdown of population growth.
For tens of thousands of years, the human population has tend to increase and decrease without really showing a trend set in the long term.
It is only over the last centuries along with the rise of modern economic life that the world population soared, passing from a billion people in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and a projected 9 billion in 2050.
This explosive growth has been made possible thanks to the huge advances in science and technology.
But this unprecedented growth has also put a on our test . 
We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth voluntarely, and we should recognise that the stabilisation of the world population would bring a plus for human happiness and increase the sustainability of the environment for the future.

Are foreign investors still welcomed?
Global flows of foreign direct investment FDI have soared over the past twenty years from 40 billion in the early 1980s to 900 billion dollars year . 
The total stock of the FDI reached nearly 10 billion , making it the most efficient mechanism for of goods and services to foreign markets sales by foreign subsidiaries amounting to roughly 19 billion , compared to exports of 11 billion . 
Meanwhile, the liberalisation of the FDI in virtually every country is a major force for trade between the companies, the vital source of emerging system integrated production and international already about a third of global trade.
But is this beautiful time coming to an end?
If the FDI can provide many benefits , it has many costs .
In the 1970s, when the transnational corporations (STN), which started such investments have been noticed, many governments believed that the costs of FDI exceeded their profits and have therefore controlled it.
The pendulum, held by developed countries, began to wave in the 1980s.
Once regarded as part of the problem, the FDI has become a solution to economic growth and development.
Nothing illustrates it better than the changes in the national systems of FDI.
As the UN Conference on Trade and Development reports, among the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004, 93% were aimed at creating an environment more hospitable to the STN.
But the risk that the pendulum is set to swing back in the other round is real , resulting in a decline of this process of liberalisation . 
The FDI in developed countries (and increasingly in emerging markets) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions.
The resistance to such steps is becoming more frequent when they involve companies that politicians regard as a "national champions' or play a role in national security, economic development or cultural identity.
The growing involvement of private equity firms in the activities of mergers and acquisitions raises other controversies, because such transactions are typically considered purely speculative.
In the name of "economic patriotism," security and other considerations, resistance to mergers and acquisitions is being codified in an increasing number of countries.
For example , a US Senate panel recently tried to block the for the liberalisation of the rules panel foreign takeover for airlines , and Europe has set panel more restrictive laws on takeover bid . 
In addition , governments are applying stricter regulatory provisions concerning the control takeover bid by foreign companies . 
This answer is linked to a defensive reaction to the growing role of STN emerging markets , the small news . 
The STNs already well established , and their country of origin , will have to adapt to this new constellation of strength and its implications for the global market . 
Like other circumstances have taught us , it is not easy to circumstances for newcomers compare , for example , the circumstances to the rapprochement between French Alcatel and circumstances , an American takeover of China National Offshore circumstances Corporation by Chevron or that of Mittal for Acelor . 
Another type of defensive reaction , this time toward the FDI , may well arise when the outsourcing of services has picked up speed .
All indications are that the offshoring has achieved a level and that this phenomenon is to be speeded up through the FDI.
If the countries of origin don't put in place adjustment mechanisms to adapt the rapid revolution which makes sector jobs services , a political backlash against one such as FDI toward the outside be inevitable . 
The growing malaise with FDI is so far largely confined to developed malaise . 
Some signs indicate, however, that it extends to emerging markets.
In the case of large scale projects , some of the host countries raise questions on contracts that define their relationship with the transnationals , governments review such contracts because they think rightly or wrongly that they have not received a fair market .
Of the 219 of international arbitration known for investment projects , some two thirds were initiated during the past three years . 
The approaches of the FDI have changed in the past, and they can still change in the future, according to how governments see the balance of costs and benefits.
This involves not only economic factors , but also considerations such as safety and the desire to control a country's economic development . 
The concept of twenty first century , introduced by the Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala , reflects the economic patriotism of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin . 
The reservations against the FDI (as with everything that is alien) are in all groups of countries, and when politicians are at the forefront protectionism is not far away.
It would be ironic that the developed countries , who led the wave of liberalisation of FDI in the past twenty years , start an opposite movement . 
Hope that the movement of dé-libéralisation which is taking place in the developed countries can be monitored before it spreads to other parts of the world and have undesirable consequences on all.

The energy culture.
The global warming to the volatile oil prices, a global energy crisis seems to happen.
To meet this challenge , humanity cannot afford to ignore resource abundant organic materials that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis . 
Solar energy allows plants to absorb carbon and so produce not just oxygen , but also the matter that the animal kingdom uses to feed itself , and that our machines can use to obtain energy . 
Since the Neolithic, humans are growing this biomass to feed themselves.
À our too times its energy potential is ignored . 
À from the industrial revolution, humans have sought the energy from coal, and later in the oil and natural gas, which led to the depletion of resources that are not renewable.
the alternatives for diversifying energy production are limited.
Nuclear power has a number of objections, particularly in terms of security and radioactive waste.
Hydroelectric power is already widely used , as for wind solar energy , they are by their very nature sporadic unevenly available .
Biomass, on the other hand, has several advantages.
It is widespread, in large quantities, around the world.
In addition , we have long mastered the technology needed to convert it into energy , including high carbonisation , gasification and into disintegration fuel . 
This technology widely used during World War II, has experienced considerable progress since.
The biomass energy, however, is a victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels.
Oil prices reflect its extraction, refining, and distribution costs, but not those of the creation of raw material.
Millions of years and 200 tonnes of plants are required to produce a litre of tonnes , while it takes 15 kilos of plant material tonnes produce a liter of compact compact . 
When oil was sinking afloat in less than $20 per barrel, the attraction of the development of renewable energy from biomass has fallen and there was more interested as the militants' green 'and those involved with basic science.
But the potential is huge.
The biomass of the planet the forests , grasslands , the savanes and cultures , is a productive capital which generates a yield of 10 each year . 
In the image of a battery that is empty and is recharged thanks to the sun , this energy is indefinitely renewable , as long as it is properly managed . 
The yield on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tonnes, and yet only two billion tonnes are used for food and 10 billion tonnes for energy purposes.
Increasing the responsible use of this source of energy would help the against climate change by reducing the proportion of carbon in the atmosphere and by reducing the amount of fossil fuel needed to produce energy . 
In addition , its abundance in the South promises to facilitate their economic development .
Regarded as energy of the poor until today , biomass could become a source of wealth , today that it is grown and used with the support today the international community . 
, energy crops could be developed to produce biofuel .
The remnants of forestry, agriculture and agro-industrielles could be collected and converted.
The six million tonnes of waste produced each year by Niger could theoretically be used to satisfy the needs of this country . 
Growing energy would surely crate competition for food crops in many countries.
Long term estimates predict plans 50 years from now , most arable land term plans world should be used to produce term protection to protect forest resources . 
Therefore, areas dedicated to energy production, particularly to biofuels, may not achieve the level companies would wish.
But in that such a competition reveals new global shortages, it could lead to price increases, thereby encouraging producers to increase their yields and productivity.
It's Although that the energy culture would create new constraints , but it would also open new opportunities for many economic players . 
farmer and could invest in the market farmer the in minor crops , the banker in farmer , etc . . 
It is necessary to implement new policies in the north and south, in terms of agriculture, water management and the Earth, protection of biodiversity, taxation of fuel, information and public awareness, to prepare for an increase in energy crops.
The ancient Égyptiens and the Incas practiced a cult of the sun , Égyptiens they thought he cult the origin of all life Égyptiens Earth . 
Science has agree with them since.
Today, when it has become more important than ever to use renewable resources, we should use the sun to grow our energy, like our ancestors did for their food.

The creation of company 
The world's governments want to encourage the creation of businesses.
Even though many start-ups will become ever more significant, every small business is an experience, and we need much to give birth to one that could transform the economy of a nation, or even just to gain international dimension.
In short creation company is an incubator , also essential to creation term company success . 
Nowadays , to explain differences in terms of between companies , we consider the divergence in attitudes and companies policies . 
But it must also take into account the great differences within the country.
Residents of Shanghai are said to have a more entrepreneurial point of view than those of Beijing.
The inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Kherson are more that than those in Kiev . 
In a recent study, mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov, of the Stockholm School of Economics, showed the extent of differences in the area of the creation of businesses in the cities in Sweden.
They define the entrepreneurs as people who declare resources coming from the companies they control and in which they work at least part-time, and see that the proportion of business leaders in the population differs substantially in the 289 cities they have studied, varying from 1.5% to 18.5%.
What do these differences say of the real causes for the creation of company?
The variations policies at national level can justify the variations identified by Gianetti and Simonov.
In the and early , the central agreements on the threshold of wages were dissolved and the Swedish government reduced income taxes businesses taxes . 
Accordingly , the number of start ups has doubled in the country , but success has been very different from one city to another .
Why?
The cultural variables seem to take up a large part: half of the variations are due to religion and municipal politics.
Cities tend to have more entrepreneurs when they have a high proportion of retired members of the Church of Sweden the official state church until 2000 and a right wing electorate .
In addition, there is a phenomenon of cause: the cities that have the most entrepreneurs tend to create even more.
Once a culture of business company takes root , it spreads to the that people company more about advantage in the business world and start company feel attracted even if the benefits are not immediately company . 
Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov found that the average income of CEO is lower in the cities with more companies in those who are less.
Similarly , studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often earn less initially and saw their incomes grow more slowly than if they were employees . 
These studies suggest that the differences in terms of the creation of businesses are perhaps less due to better economic opportunities (the "supply" of the equation for the creation of company) to the cultural differences that make the creation of businesses more fulfilling a personal point of view (the "calls").
This assumption is highlighted by Giannetti and Simonov, who believe that the differences of prestige of entrepreneurs in the various cities can justify the disparities.
In some boroughs , business leaders enjoy a high social status , whether they are successful or not ; elsewhere they are not considered and other activities are more admirées . 
The idea that prestige is important is not new.
In his book Morals and money , the sociologist Michèle Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United States . 
She asks the inhabitants of the two countries what does it mean to be "a person of value."
In fact, she consult with them on what they consider important in life and on their sense of identity.
Lamont's study confirmed the conventional wisdom that for Americans , success in business is important , while the French place greater on culture and quality of life . 
Similarly , the opened contempt opened of tough greedy businessmen the competition is more often expressed in France than in America .
But while Lamont focuses on the differences between the French and the Americans discovery his most interesting research is that on the significant differences between various regions of France . 
She compares Clermont Ferrand , administrative of Auvergne in central France , and Paris . 
The auvergnats has a reputation for thrift and discipline and , auvergnats recent progress , for a relative shortage of culture . 
Lamont found that both Parisians and Clermontois tended to express have for greed . 
On the other However , the people of Clermont admire simplicity , pragmatism , hard work , and strong will as Parisians relate more to vigor and talent .
It concludes that , in many ways , the of clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers the inhabitants of the clermontois État of Indiana , in the Midwest than to Parisians clermontois 
His research suggests that in Clermont Ferrand , the intrinsic content for businesses is higher than in Paris . 
Almost all countries are units of local cultures that differ in way they units people and shape their identity . 
The differences in the these define a person of value , and in how this value manifests itself , probably explain a lot about the of changes levels in different companies . 
Economists are not alone in often considering countries in groups , to try to determine the key factors , such as attitudes policies , that encourage or discourage entrepreneurship .
But , in fact , national success in this area depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies .
The enthusiasm for the creation of company can take root in any region culturally attractive to any country, once removed the economic constraints, which are Dam, then acquire national importance in the Fed itself.

University investments
Yale University , where I teach , has been fund its funds to only one person , David Swensen for fund 20 years ago . 
During this period, this portfolio has risen from just over 1 billion to $18 billion -- an average yield of more than 16% per year, which is the highest of all the major universities.
And it shows no sign of weakness; at the last fiscal year ending in June, the yield was 22,9%.
the presidents of Yale succeed one another , Swensen remains .
He has done more for the university than any other president, or than anyone else.
In a university, ideas are worth more than money, but $18 billion can create a favorable environment to many new ideas.
With 11 500 students, it is more than 1.5 million dollars per student (not counting the buildings of the University or its collection of art, worth several billion dollars each).
How has this been possible?
How could Swensen make so much money ? 
Everyone is asking that demand including us , at Yale . 
Indeed , many here teaching the efficient markets hypothesis , which claims that the world's financial markets have become so competitive that it is impossible to obtain a return on investment above normal . 
Anyone who breaks the market has just a stroke of luck.
The studies seem to confirm this phenomenon.
For inquiry , a 2004 by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of inquiry University of California and Yi Tsung Lee and Yiu inquiry Liu of the National Chengchi University collected inquiry transactions transaction data on individual day traders in the inquiry stock market . 
The study revealed that only 1% of day traders reaped a profit -- after deducting transaction costs -- during both periods of six consecutive months, and that the average profit valued little for such an effort: $4,000.
It is easy to conclude that it is futile to try to beat the market.
But then we think about people like Swensen.
Can the consistency of its good results really be attributed to luck?
Robert Kiyosaki , author of the books success on investment Rich Dad , books Dad , bases the and the themes of his books on a comparison between his highly qualified father books his friend's father , who dropped out in middle school books 
According À Kiyosaki , scholar wise but impécunieux father À to be pessimistic about scholar possibilities of everyone achieving À something real life , scholar had discouraged impécunieux son À trying . 
However, the father of his friend loved to try to do great things.
Is the fact that he became rich a coincidence?
Kiyosaki is perhaps trying too hard to be inspiring , but I often think of him when I hear finance teachers pronounce on the efficiency of markets how absurd it is to earn money through transactions .
It may be that many academics find it difficult to take action in the real world -- and I have not yet met another Professor claiming to have read Kiyosaki.
But Swensen is a with university doctor . D . in economics . 
It is surrounded by academics.
discussions this efficiency efficient markets has not discouraged him from discussions his efficiency to get there . 
There seems to be a model.
Two similar universities, Harvard and Princeton, have practically known the same success.
The fund of funds from Harvard, under Jack Meyer, has increased its average annual rate of 15.2% over the past ten years, which can be compared to 17.2% of Swensen, and the allocation of Princeton, under Andrew Golden, won by an average 15.6% per year.
In fact, Golden has worked under the auspices of Swensen at Yale in 1988 and 1993.
Swensen wrote two books on investment, one for professionals and one for the public.
In closing closing , I did not have the impression of being closing to do what he did . 
But some elements are imposed on me.
One of them is its long-term vision.
Yale lets Swensen invest in the very long term, and does not bother him with quarterly results.
Perhaps it allows him to focus more on long term , and to make investments that don't necessarily have a good return in the short term . 
But it has always had good results both short-term and long-term.
Part of the success of Swensen is the absolute return , a term now widespread in the investors , which he invented to describe unusual investment strategies involving things like arbitration on mergers and acquisitions and difficulties distressed securities . 
It has also invested in non traditional assets , such as real estate , oil , timber , investment , venture capital resumption and businesses . 
These assets are not generally followed by many analysts , and are not easy to understand , which was giving him a greater advantage by leveraging his intellectual capacity and the expertise how of his entourage . 
In this direction , Swensen is completely different from day traders direction who invest in the short term and trying to direction the most liquid market values listed direction . 
But I also think the phenomenal success of Swensen and his peers reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticism . 
The problem comes from a defeatist attitude, not from scholarship.
When an analytical mind , a spirit trained to rigorously pursue the truth , is part spirit a community of such people free question self doubt , it can produce amazing things . 
I know David Swensen, and I can attest that this is not a solitary day trader trying to beat the market.
He knows how to listen, to support people in whom he has confidence, and he is surrounded by several people with numerous and varied qualities.
And he has nothing of a defeatist.

A moral 
According to forecasts, global consumption of meat will double by 2020.
But in Europe and North America , there are increasing aspect about the methods production how meat and eggs are produced . 
Veal calf has fallen since it became commonly known use to calf white veal pale pink , in use , newborn calves are calf from their mother , anémiés rendered use , deprived fibre and packed into stalls so small use they calf walk or turn around . 
In Europe, the mad cow disease has shocked many, not just because it has discredited the image of food safe and healthy beef, but also because the public learned that this disease was caused by the feeding of cows and fed to brain and nervous tissue of sheep.
People who naively believed that cows ate grass, discovered that the herds meant to become our food could eat anything, from corn to fish, from the litter of chicken (excrement included) to the waste from slaughterhouses.
The concerns raised by our way of dealing with animals are far from being restricted to the small percentage of vegetarian or végétaliens , those who do not consume any product of animal origin . 
Despite the strength of the moral arguments in favour végétariennes practices , it is not yet the favour opinion . 
The most common position is that our consumption of meat is justified the animals are living a decent life before being killed .
The problem , as Jim Mason and I describe in our last book , The Way We Eat , is that industrial agriculture denies any chance to animals to live a decent . 
Tens of billions of chicken products nowadays never go outdoor . 
They are conditioned to have a fierce appetite they grow as fast as possible , to be raised in hangars which can contain more than 20 , 000 animals .
The rate of ammonia in the air , due accumulation their accumulated fientes , stings the eyes and rate lungs . 
Killed at only 45 days, their immature bones can hardly support the weight of their bodies.
Some are crumbling and , unable to reach water or food , are quick to die . Their fate is insubstantial on the amount of the entire company . 
The conditions are worse for egg laying hens crammed in son cages , so small that even if they were one per , they would be unable to open their wings . 
But they are usually packed with four, often more.
In such conditions of overcrowding, the more dominant and aggressive hens can peck to death the weakest of the cage.
To avoid that , the producers cut off the side of the tooth hens a hot razor 
The tooth of a chicken is full of tissue . tooth is , after all , her principal means of communication with her environment , but no anaesthetic or reliever is used to relieve pain . 
Pigs are perhaps the most sensitive and intelligent animals we are used to eat.
When they rummage through a rural village , they can use this intelligence to explore their surroundings and its diversity . 
giving birth , sows use straw or leaves twigs to build a safe and comfortable nest where they when care for their litter .
But in current intensive farming , pregnant sows are cooped up in cash so close together that they cannot turn around , or even take a step forward or backward . 
They are on the concrete, without straw or other form of litter.
The piglets are removed from their mother as soon as possible si it can fall pregnant again , but they never leave the hangar before being led to the slaughterhouse .
Advocates of these methods of production argue that they are regrettable but are necessary to meet demand food of a population that continues to grow . 
Instead , when we confinons animals in intensive farming , we need to confinons food for them . 
The animals burn most of the energy provided by the food just to breathe and heat their bodies, therefore in the end we get only a small fraction, usually no more than a third, and sometimes only a tenth of the value of food that we give them.
However , cows that basis in the fields are eating food that we cannot basis , which means that they add to the quantity basis food that is available . 
It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they get richer, copy the methods of Western and parquent animals in huge industrial farms to provide more meat and eggs at their middle classes in the development.
If this continues , the result will be animal suffering greater even than currently exists in the West animal more damage to the environment and an increase in animal disease and cancer of the digestive system . 
This will also be completely ineffective.
As consumers , we have the power and the moral obligation , to refuse to support methods of which are cruel to the animals and bad for us .

fear and freedom on the Internet
We learned earlier this month that at the request of Chinese leaders, Microsoft had closed the website of a Chinese blogger hosted on a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces.
The blogger , Zhao Jing , published details of a strike of the journalists at the Beijing New , who followed the referral of the editor libre penseur newspaper . 
gesture raises a key issue the Internet really gesture a force for that repressive issue can not control as gesture as newspapers , radio and issue ? 
How ironic to think that the founder and leader of Microsoft , Bill Gates , has been an enthusiastic supporter of this of view . 
Last year , he rightly said There's really no way to wider year repress information today , and I think it's a year all rejoice . . . C ' is year means of communication with an and a total freedom year and that's what makes it so special . 
Despite these sentiments, Microsoft is doing its best to help the Chinese authorities censor information.
A spokesman for Microsoft said that the company had blocked many sites in China , and it is known for several months that the tool used to make Chinese bloggers words like democracy and human rights when they appear in the titles of personal sites . 
The defence of Microsoft is that it must "comply with the local and global laws."
But the sites of MSN Spaces are hosted by the American servers.
The relevant local respect in this case are those of the United States , and discussions respect Zhao Jing on strike Beijing journalists respect not violate any of them . 
Neither is there a global law preventing the Chinese from discussing events that their government would prefer not to see them . 
The New York Times, for example, is free to publish articles on the strike, even if it is broadcast on a website that all Internet users with free access can consult.
If the Chinese government does not want its people read a foreign newspaper, it is up to them to find a way to block access.
The newspaper had no nothing to do so on his place . 
The defence of Microsoft has therefore a long past . 
We can only guess the real reasons that led him to close the site, and fears of an impact on his commercial interests in China could be a major factor.
Admittedly , a company can and limits limit the use of its services . 
The line absolutist, which is to allow complete freedom to prevail, collapses in the face of troubling examples.
According to Gates, Microsoft could prevent the use of its services if they were used to broadcast instructions to manufacture a nuclear bomb, to send the Nazi propaganda in Germany, where it is illegal, or to spread the child pornography.
Are these examples truly valid?
In its classic defence of freedom of expression , On Liberty , John Stuart Mill said that the most important reason to allow freedom of expression is to promote competition between the broadest possible ideas , and that debate without hindrance constitutes the best way of testing them . 
Protecting the ideas of criticism , the government turns them into rigid dogma and life , whether true or not . 
If we agree with Mill, then one example of Gates corresponds to the category of expressions that need to be protected.
revenue for making nuclear bombs are , not ideas revenue 
Child pornography is not an expression of ideas .
So we can reduce both without contradicting the thesis of Mill.
On the other hand , an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults taking a sexual interest in children , and that such conduct should be permitted , expresses ideas , and so vile that 'they can strike us as such should not be censored .
The most difficult of Gates' three examples is the one of pro Nazi statements on a site aimed at Germany . 
That Germany wants to ban such views, is easily understandable.
The laws of many countries ban incitement to racial hatred , which can be justified , in agreement with Mill's defence of freedom , if such laws focus closely on incitement to hatred rather than on the removal of ideas , harmful they may be , that appeal to the intellectual capacity of people .
A defender of the removal of Nazi ideas could argue that they have already removal tried , and that they have failed in the most removal way imaginable to produce a better society . 
Nevertheless , the best possible sign that would show that Germany has overcome its Nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on racial hatred , rather than on Nazism as such . 
In all cases , the crackdown in China in of straightforward reporting discussions of events taking place in this country is not in the removal of a discredited political ideology , but that of a open political debate and . 
If Bill Gates really believes that the Internet should play a role as a liberating force, he should ensure that Microsoft is not doing the dirty work of the Chinese government.

The Weaknesses of a Strong Dollar
It is always dangerous to write an article about exchange rate . 
If the exchange rate of a currency falls, it can be up when the article seems.
The continuing question is of how to think the exchange rate and their proper management . 
The issue here is not only the falling dollar , but what American officials intend to implement in that respect .
Paul O'Neill , the very direct U . S . Finance Minister , suggested that the U . S . can not and will not intervene to support the dollar . 
His remarks have been criticised by some who see it as an abandonment of the strong dollar policy that caractérisa the Clinton administration . 
One of the responsibilities relating to economic leadership is to dispel myths, certainly not to create them.
The politics of the strong dollar is a particularly egregious example of the economic myths that can develop . This myth suggests that the Treasury could , and would like to , maintain a strong dollar , and that a strong dollar would be beneficial to the United States . 
When I led the White House Economic Council, I was often asked if I supported the strong dollar policy.
I would always that I supported the dollar.
In other words, exchange rates are no different from others.
As for the price of apples or oranges, they should be fixed by the market.
Anyone who declares to prefer a policy of strong would be immediately laughed at . 
And yet , many appear to have the utmost confidence in the market and see that the exchange rate as governed by laws , other than those of the mainstream economy that would say a word even a simple glance from the finance minister could raise lower the currencies .
The foreign exchange markets are of course very irrational.
Keynes described a day the market values as a beauty contest where the aim was not to assess the smartest person but the other would crown.
The aim of a foreign exchange market, in fact, is often to guess what others think.
And even if government policies can affect the exchange rate in the short term, in the long term, it's only the market rules that count.
The government can find a legitimate role to play in limiting the market volatility, but if the basic rules of the market does not lead the charge of exchange rates, where does our confidence in the market?
Adhering to false inevitably leads to greater . 
One day , a journalist was interviewing the US Treasury Secretary on the negative effects of the strong dollar in terms of exports at the time , cars sales and other were suffering from the strong dollar . 
He replied that a strong dollar meant that the economy was strong and of that , exports were strengthened .
Despite everything, even the Ministry of Finance, as strong as it is, cannot undo the laws of the market economy.
The levels of demand are flagging ; , when prices are high , American products are less sought out , and a strong dollar means that American products are more expensive .
The strongest counterpoint to the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between the dollar and a strong economy . 
We should not develop a sentimental to exchange rates any more than to any other price . 
A high exchange rate discourages exports , faced with the unemployment of its work force , a country can see its economy to go from bad to worse .
In Moreover , a high exchange rate may also help lower inflation since import prices fall .
If inflation is the first concern , then when higher exchange rate could prove beneficial for the economy .
The strong dollar policy reeks of economic nationalism that stands out in an era of globalisation . 
If the dollar is strong, then the euro and the yen are weakened.
And so what are the reactions of political leaders of other countries?
Will they simply comform to the dollar dollar policy , even if it implies a policy of dollar weak yen or ? 
It is necessary to create conditions for a debate with the United since , the strong dollar policy leads to an unusual situation the richest country seems unable to live up to its means and must continually borrow hundreds billions of dollars from abroad to finance its huge trade deficit .
The strong dollar fueled the bilateral deficit with Japan more than Japanese protectionism did . 
He also contributed to the protectionist policy of the United States that we see at today in the price policy steel . 
It is time that the insanity of the strong dollar policy be abandoned . 
Paul O'Neill should be praised for his efforts in this area.
Maybe we could now start seriously thinking about the creation of an international economic system taking account of the devastating effects of the volatility of the main currencies for the least developed countries in to ensure greater stability . 
We have for too long accused the victims.
It has only served to avoid seriously considering the system itself.

Has China mistaken her world?
Cheating.
How , says the United States , could China undercut U . S . producers in all areas ? 
For decades, America has seemed to dominate production such that American officials have focused on the liberalization of trade for manufactured products.
They spent little effort to establish an equality for farmers because they knew that America could not compete on the agricultural plan . 
China now outshines other countries, capturing huge trade surpluses with the United States.
The US Treasury Secretary accuses China of keeping its exchange rate deliberately low and asks it to let market trends determine the value of the renminbi .
The IMF chief economist , Ken Rogoff , who is leaving his post , warns that trade surpluses threaten global stability . 
For those who recall the crisis that occurred in East Asia five years ago, all of this seems to go against what was said at the time.
China had been urged not to let its currency float.
Until the implosion of the Argentine peso , fixed exchange rates implosion ideally suited . 
The US Treasury had welcomed the government intervention in the markets of exchange rates and had encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with the méga billions of dollars to countries in crisis.
If China had left its currency float again , it would have devalued and would have intensified the crisis .
The country have received a warning avoid trade surpluses and accumulate reserves country these are the main defence of . 
The East Asian countries followed this advice, for a good reason: they had already seen the consequences of a lack of reserves.
The governments of East Asia knew when the policies of the IMF would serve only to worsen the economic downturn , but they found themselves unable to resist it .
The IMF had the money they urgently need . 
China and Malaysia , lucky enough not to have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to follow their own of line , have acted as they should they have conducted expansionary fiscal and monetary policies . 
China's economy has continued to grow by 7%; Malaysia has experienced the shortest and most superficial economic downturn.
To understand the stakes of this fight, it is necessary to explain a few fundamental economic concepts in detail.
First, international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage; the countries export goods in which they have a relative advantage on and bring those in which they have a relative disadvantage .
Overall, America currently has a relative disadvantage in terms of manufacturing, while China has a relative advantage.
China should export manufactured products to the United States . 
Secondly , if a country invests more than it savings , it will be forced to borrow and will therefore experience savings trade deficit . 
The burgeoning trade deficit is the result of America's unprecedented mismanagement of the Bush Administration.
The tax cuts that America could hardly afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit , rather than encourage savings , the U . borrowing . government borrowed , part of which from abroad . 
It is this bad management, and not China's exchange rate policy that is the culprit.
In fact, the overall trade surplus in China is currently low (about 1% of its GDP).
Of course, the Bush administration wants to lay the blame on others, but neither China nor any other country should be duped.
This situation recalls the events of 20 years ago, when President Reagan had drawn up huge tax cuts which were supposed to rectify the situation, but which actually resulted in huge fiscal deficits, which in turn led to huge trade deficits.
At that time was in Japan that America had rejected the responsibility of these deficits.
The truth is that neither the IMF or the Bush administration does  truly believe in free markets.
They hinder the markets when they find it in their interest.
The Bush administration has bailed out airlines, given agriculture unprecedented subsidies and protected the tariffs imposed on steel.
The IMF is right: there is a real risk of global instability, but the underlying cause of this threat lies in the massive borrowing undertaken by the US abroad, which began under President Ronald Reagan.
The US has become a debtor country with enormous debts .
If one day, the creditors of America decided to be reimbursed, they could trigger large movements of exchange rates and thus cause a global instability.
Why has the IMF not severely criticised these deficits?
Why should the world's richest country live beyond its means while the IMF the poorest countries for their less important transgressions ? 
This problem is compounded by the global reserve system which welcomes the demands of most countries requesting US dollars, but only penalises them more.
The system requires that the country that holds the reserve currency in this case , the US is piling up debts until the other countries do not confidence it anymore . 
But to solve the deeply rooted problems in the global financial system, we must overcome the complacency which has long since taken over the G-7 and the unilateralism that defines the current American administration.
reason was right to ignore the demands of America . 
The flotation of the exchange rate would have exposed the country flotation instability that would have led to a host flotation other problems , which would particularly hit the country's precarious banking system flotation 
A higher exchange rate would have shaken the process of job creation and contributed to deflation, which China is currently not experiencing.
China has the chance to have the freedom necessary to pursue its own targets . 
Its huge foreign reserves allow it to ignore the IMF and the US Department . 
Finally , this could be the most compelling reason why China must continue to maintain trade surpluses . 
Once again, China has shown its mastery of the basic economic principles.
The other countries in the loss not having done likewise .

Will Italy survive Berlusconi?
If history seems to support Silvio Berlusconi in the category of Italian prime ministers, he will leave the memory of a prime minister out of the ordinary and more bizarre.
Making one promise but keeping another has been more a principle of government action than a weakness.
Given its nature , it is hardly surprising that since the nature election , which brought it power , the nature left coalition , the Unione , has won all nature elections administrative elections , regional and European . 
But the success of the left in the next elections is not assured , and the fate of Berlusconi has not yet been sealed . 
Given the country's economic situation, one would think Italy ripe for change.
For the past four years, the average income has risen by only 0.3% per year, whereas it has increased by an average of 1.5% in the European Union, and for the past two years the public debt has started growing again.
The strategy of Berlusconi's center-right coalition, Casa della Alliance, has consisted of doing nothing until the European economy recovers, instead of addressing the structural problems in Italy.
This is why it is not only the unions who criticize the government , but also the Cofindustria employers' organisation , which had put all its weight behind Berlusconi in 2001 . 
There is also the incessant conflict of interests between Berlusconi and the Prime Minister Berlusconi tycoon the press, which holds licenses in the area television that give it a position of semi-monopole advertising in the media and on television.
During his term, his personal fortune has increased threefold.
The parliamentary majority number many laws in favour of his personal interests and number flattened some of the legal obstacles that were in number way . However , at the of March , Berlusconi was number again accused of corruption and tax fraud . 
The conduct of its ministers has been scarcely improved.
Two of them , Roberto Calderoli and Francesco Storace , have been forced to resign a months . 
The first , a leader of the Northern League , the third party in the government coalition in order of importance , caused riots in Libya by wearing a T shirt with the infamous cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad . 
The second , former health minister and one of the leaders second the National Alliance , the second of the government second , is suspected to be the source of spying second a political Watergate to the Italian . 
Despite this catastrophic catalogue , both from an economic economy ethics catalogue according to polls , economy Union shows catalogue four point , too little economy terms of catalogue number of undecided voters to predict economy election result . 
Why is it that Berlusconi and his coalition are still in the race?
Above all , Berlusconi's election campaign , like that of Bush in 2004 , aims at mobilizing its supporters and attracting the increasing mass of non voters . 
For this , he has not hesitated to use his semi monopoly on television to tout the supposed performed by his government . 
His campaign campaigning is based on that had campaigning been seen in Italy since 1948 , coupled with a campaigning defence family and values cherished by the establishment campaigning the Roman Catholic Church , despite the that the Church had campaigning drawn from the far left in the campaign campaigning 
The coalition of Berlusconi is also benefiting from the weakness of the Union . 
Its leader, Romano Prodi, has won extraordinary popular support, with more than four million votes cast in primary elections, the first of its kind in Italy.
Even without a party , he continues to be the head of too many parties . 
The cohesion of the Unione has increased the two main parties Democratici di Democratic Party and Democrazia e alliance the Margherita gathered behind the emblem of the tree , the other parties have agree daccord a programme for the government detailed in a document of 280 pages and the Left Party Partito Della has given signs of moderation devoid of any ambiguity and loyalty to the coalition . 
Still , to the voters , the coalition remains fragile .
Finally , uncertainty about the elections' election does not reflect the attitude of voters more than election change of the electoral system . 
During the last decade , the Italian electoral system was based on a majority vote with one tour with a dose of proportional representation . 
With this system , Casa della Libertà has succeeded in 2001 in transforming a small della advance into a parliamentary majority . 
But , fearing that this system no longer benefits the Union , the centre right parliamentary majority changed the electoral rules only a few months before the end of its . 
This is reminiscent of the military strategy which is to defeat looming on the battlefield, poison the well before retreating.
A proportional system without a chance to choose individual candidates results in the secretaries , rather than the people , choosing the members , and , in the absence of a real election threshold , parties are proliferating . 
The voting papers will be 40 centimeters long to include all the symbols of the old and new parties , but one wouldn't find the name of any one candidate . 
But more serious is that the majority-rule electoral system for the Senate could lead to a majority opposed to that of Parliament, leading to a political deadlock.
And that's not all , the mandate of President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi will end at a time when Parliament will be dissolved , so that his successor will be elected by the new members may have to appoint a government with a different majority in each House .
Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a grand coalition of the kind  which exists in Germany, a highly-unlikely result after a campaign in which each of the two candidates made clear that the other didn't have a legitimate right to govern.
And one more election would not solve the problem of the electoral system.
The headache of the political survival of Berlusconi reflects a wider problem at the European level.
Many Europeans, and not only the Italians, are worried and do not know where the continent is heading towards.
It is therefore not surprising that an opportunistic and a like Berlusconi continue to hold the hearing . 
The Italians must decide for the future of their country if they want a leader who has the necessary stature.

The game of trans-Atlantic criticism
As if the diplomatic spats about Iraq were not enough, relations between America and Europe are slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies.
Indeed , the differences between the economic strategies on both sides are as sharply as they have been over two decades . 
At first sight, the depth of this "political divide" seems surprising.
The economic outlook for the rest of this year and in 2004 have recently improved in both the US and Europe.
In addition , the US and Europe are facing a similar challenge promoting economic recovery .
But the actions of their government or rather the lack of action seems to indicate that none of the two sides can see the problems faced by the other . 
During the introduction of the euro , most of the EU Germany , in particular have looked forward to manage their economic policies with greater autonomy and less American pressure . 
, the current structure in the euro zone , with its unique mix of common monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy , was not built to facilitate macro economic coordination with the USA .
But the perception of many Americans was different.
They considered the central involvement of the euro as a to force Europe to be stripped of its supposed free rider role on the international economic scene , a role that has left the United States to shoulder the burden of adjustment policies to promote global growth . 
Europe will inevitably be forced to coordinate its policy with America.
These two views were destined to come into conflict and that is what is happening today.
The tensions overshadowed in the long boom of the Clinton era were revealed in 2001 when America tried to cope with the decline of its economy by releasing its monetary and fiscal policy.
the huge budget deficits surfaced , the European scepticism about the viability of the external deficit in America and the strength of the also returned .
Meanwhile , criticism have seen the euro zone as too cautious criticism it undercut slowly interest rates and maintint fiscal constraints criticism stability and growth . 
Originally, the Europeans had underestimated the economic slowdown which they were facing.
Later, they were constrained by the limits imposed on their fiscal responses, limits set by the Maastricht Treaty; the major economies of continental Europe had not reached a sufficient budgetary consolidation during the years of continuous growth.
Monetary and fiscal policies have facilitated growth but Europe has not done much to redress the imbalance of America . 
Of course, the euro zone is so large that it can no longer abdicate responsibility to stimulate global growth in America.
But the American efforts to encourage people to adopt their discretionary and pragmatic approach to economic policy lead inevitably to the frustration: the problems faced by the European economies unlike the one in the United States, like the perceptions of the challenges.
In fact , the main reasons for the wholesale change in American public finance from a 2000 surplus to a deficit of over 4 in 2003 04 have very relation to stabilisation . 
In addition to the costs of the war in Iraq and other security issues and shortcomings in the previous spending controls , tax cuts in the United States obey targets and distributional distributionnels rather than short term goals . 
A short term stimulus would not have given the most significant term to the richest people , whose expenses are less term by taxes . 
The tax cuts need to support private demand this year and next year, but at the cost of the postponement of improvements in economies and the private debt.
Although the dollar has already been depreciated for a year , continued growth in domestic demand will probably increase the current account deficit to 5 of GDP . 
While the deficit rises more, it is highly likely that the dollar should again be depreciated in spite of performance rather slow the other major economies in the world.
Is the United States will accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and could Europe offer a greater contribution to global growth?
It is probably not.
The equivalent of the emphasis placed by the US on independence rather than on direct public assistance is represented by the desire to maintain employment at high levels , whichever party in power , while most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rate of 8 or more . 
The US should opt for growth .
Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between the potential yield and the real return in the major economies of continental Europe is now lower than in the United States.
The cuts in income to stimulate demand for labour tax cuts are desirable given the existing high rates in tax cuts of Europe . 
But the tax cuts that should be soon cancelled because of population pressure exerted on pensions and public health care are unlikely to stimulate demand loser consumer confidence in the government's ability to control the deficit . 
Europe needs structural reforms and a more rigorous fiscal management, not inflation.
The EU countries are finally starting to accelerate their implementation of structural reforms , but the starting point has become less favourable and political resistance too firmly anchored , as is examples by the recent conflict on the French pension reforms and on the German labour market . 
Further depreciation of the dollar and slower U.S. growth would undermine the Eu's exports, the only relatively successful component of demand in Europe.
The difference between policy and its time will be concealed by difference prospect for improved growth in Europe and the US for difference next year . 
But the medium term perspective is that of a transatlantic showdown that could create many divisions that conflicts on the war in Iraq .
If this is true , the Doha round of world trade , currently being held , could be the first to suffer . 
It will be more difficult to resist protectionism on both sides of the Atlantic.
The US cannot afford a continued massive drain on the through an external deficit while complaints relating to the loss of competitiveness have intensified in the EU . 
The thought that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could calm down quickly or quietly tests the test .

A multilateral engagement in favour of energy security 
The countries of the world are linked just as much by their common need for energy security as by the global network which takes distribution distributing this energy . 
A failure in a of the network , and we are all affected . Local interests and persistent conflicts that life , especially the unresolved issue of the supplies to Ukraine and Europe in Russian gas , remind us once again that energy can be used as a means of political pressure . 
Energy security is one of the key part of the G 8 meeting , that President part Putin is hosting in St Petersburg . 
The G-8 was able to identify the essential economic issue, namely energy interdependence, and it is time today to make specific multilateral commitments in this area.
For some countries , those that are chance to have vast reserves of oil and gas , chance is tempting to use exports to reward friends chance punish enemies . 
But these days , such a strategy is likely to destabilize both friends and enemies , and to damage the producing producer . 
Embargoes generally do not carry the expected results.
The price increases triggered by the OPEC actions in the 1970s were not tenable and have encouraged the economies of consumption and the development of production in countries not members of OPEC.
This has caused a fall in global oil exports from the OPEC in the twelve years following the 1973-1974 embargo.
Experience has taught us that transparency and stability of prices are in the interests of all.
It is essential , in to increase the potential of global economic growth , to hold onto these principles while encouraging the development of international markets . 
When Russia sought earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine, it argued that it was merely the market price.
It seemed right and, for some time, some politicians and investors little to the situation themselves harbor.
To be clear , measured and price in were never challenged ; some adjustments were price for Ukraine . 
But, unfortunately for Russia's neighbours, this is not the market which determines the price of gas from Russia or its transportation: this is the company Gazprom and its President Dmitry Medvedev, also first deputy prime minister.
The price asked by Gazprom is different for each country neighbouring Russia, and determined largely by diplomatic the relations of those countries with the Kremlin.
The prices depend more on the political situation than supply and demand or transport costs.
Ukraine was threatened with seeing its gas bill immediately increased fourfold or its supply interrupted because it had just become independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution . 
Georgia, which had attracted the ire of Moscow with the Rose Revolution, could also suffer significant price rises.
But Belarus, always very close to the Kremlin, continues to benefit from major subsidies in the energy sector.
Of course , Ukraine was not the only country affected by these intimidation tactics some providers , such as Turkmenistan , whose geographic location necessitates transporting the gas through Russia , suffer from them too . 
As for the consumer countries in western and central Europe, rising prices and fears of a disruption of supply have had significant consequences for them.
It is probably the multilateral action of the European Union and the United States that prompted Gazprom to open the floodgates.
Natural gas is perhaps the most supplies of the raw to the vagaries of policies supplies 
The fixed , interconnected pipelines lock producers and consumers in loyalty nearly absolute . 
The diversification of the delivery of natural gas is a cross-border project in the long term, which requires considerable investment and political engagement.
Many study are being studied new gas storage devices , greater efficiency , development study the national production of oil and gas , and other study sources such as methane coal . 
In addition, the market of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is growing rapidly.
It is easier to diversify the supply chain , albeit incrementally , by importing gas from distant producers and suppliers neighbours either neighboring monopoly . 
All these initiatives should make it possible to absorb shocks and to create greater energy self-sufficiency.
But we must go further.
First , G 8 leaders should consider implementing standards for transactions in the energy field , demand require open and transparent contracts that comply with the best business practices . 
It is essential to minimize the impact to the global scale of the behaviour of local politicians pursuing objectives not energy, or simply their personal interests.
We can see this of problems in business in South America , with political instability in Africa business tensions in the Middle East or even with some opaque business , as the dubious contract signed for gas between business and Russia , under the name of street RosUkrEnergo business 
Ultimately, energy security for us all in Europe is based on the recognition of our interdependence.
This is why it would be useful to create an "energy alliance" between consumers and suppliers, in which European countries would supply each other in case of major unrest.
The energy charter , which focuses on market access and transparency , is a commendable effort , but it is inadequate in of crisis . Our markets are not yet sufficiently equipped to manage supply interruptions . 
The Energy Charter could serve as a basis for a collective energy security, provided they are deeper and wider.
It is our duty, as leaders, to find a future path to energy security.
If some tolerate today suspicious transactions because of political expediency , we will all pay for when some day . 
When the inevitable conflicts arise, public confidence, political credibility and market forces are sacrificed needlessly. This is obviously what happened with Russia and Ukraine.
The threats to energy security must be countered and resolved multilaterally with the participation of all stakeholders.
Our interdependence requires us to adopt a multilateral approach.
Our future is at stake.

Lebanon in danger of manipulation
In recent weeks , Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Lebanese Forces Christian meet from time to time as of a National Dialogue . 
Their first goal is to forge a consensus on the future of Lebanon after the withdrawal of the Syrian army, which took place last year.
But this dialogue has also above all that Lebanese politics continues to play itself out outside of Lebanon . 
The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad El retains an enormous influence on the Lebanese state , in particular regards security issues , the Secret Service , the army and police , not to mention its alliance with the powerful Hezbollah militia .
The Syrian soldiers have left Lebanon a year ago, but the regime of El Assad has never accepted its withdrawal from Lebanon and it is seeking to regain some form of hegemony over the country.
The Syrian position is made more difficult by the UN investigation, which accuses it of being involved in the assassination of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, on February 14, 2005.
Syria's Lebanese allies want to improve ties between the two countries , surely the assassination of Hariri won't allow them this victory .
For the moment , the Lebanese parties have agreed not to allow the country to act as a basis for threatening in any way the Syrian regime . 
Meanwhile , Egypt and Saudi Arabia wanted at any to prevent the collapse of El Assad's regime . 
Officially these two countries are in favour of the UN investigation, but in private, their leaders have strongly pushed the Lebanese government to relax pressure on Syria.
In Lebanon, opponents of Syria have resisted this requirement, but the position of Egypt and Saudi Arabia shows that the Arab leaders do not want the fall of other despots of the region.
The attitude of Egypt and Saudi Arabia differs of the two Western powers very influential in Lebanon, the United States and France, which support the UN investigation wherever it leads.
However, those four countries agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be contained, and they are in favour, in theory, to disarm Hezbollah demanded by the Security Council resolution 1559, even if their views differ on how to get there.
Another regional problem, the unending cycle of violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, also marks the Lebanese domestic policy.
Lebanese Sunnis and Shiites - the two main groups in the country because of their population and the support they have in the region - are to be at this stage, but since few political tension is palpable.
Hariri was the main Sunni political leader, and after his murder, the two communities have taken diametrically opposed positions on Syria.
The gap between Shiites and Sunnis in Lebanon reflects the much wider regional differences between the majority of Arab countries (notably Saudi Arabia) who are Sunnis and support Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated prime minister, and Iran, which supports Hezbollah.
In Saudi Arabia , Shiites are concentrated in the east which contains the bulk of its oil , the Saudis fear that discord between Shiites Sunnis in Iraq will spread throughout the Arab world reach them .
This is why Riyadh encouraged Hariri not to break off dialogue with Hezbollah , the main force within the Shiite community in Lebanon . 
Apart from this concern, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are afraid that if Iran manages to possess nuclear weapons, it might lead to a domination of the region by Shiites.
Added to this is the tension between Iran and the US , fueled by the controversy over the nuclear and the conflict in Iraq . 
The Arab countries are sandwiched between the two , like the Lebanese , who fear paying the price in case of an American or Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities . For Hezbollah could attack Israel from southern Lebanon .
Hezbollah interprets the resolution calling for its disarmament as a plot of the Bush administration to weaken it and demonstrate American supremacy in the region.
He is refusing to disarm to what he calls the Israeli threat , but he has changed the definition because gives this threat so many times that one wonders whether he will ever give up arms . 
He recently agreed to place this issue on the negotiating agenda of domestic policy , perhaps because Iran does not want it to become a source of tension in the country , but it is as that they will lead to a real disarmament , at least in the short term . 
Finally , the Lebanese must not only manoeuvre according to regional and international , but they must also take account of American domestic politics . 
Regardless of the opinion one has on the Iraq war , one must agree that the American presence in this country has helped Lebanon to foil Syria's attempts to set in Lebanon , and those of some Arab countries to compel Lebanon to deal with a regime that does not accept its sovereignty . 
If the United States is pulling out of Iraq, it risks becoming indifferent to the situation in Lebanon.
In this case , who else besides Syria and Iran would benefit from benefits ? 
Such an outcome might be satisfying for elements the Lebanese society , in particular Hezbollah . 
But the vast majority of Lebanese want a Lebanon in peace , free from the insulation and activism that are the of Iran and Syria . 
Unfortunately, Lebanon has always been buffeted by its environment and once more, against the will of the Lebanese, it could serve as an arena for regional conflict.

A fight pushed to the extreme MP3 players against mobile . 
We will advise you how to choose.
Almost all the Mobile can read the MP3 files, any MP3 player knows telephone.
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Even Nevertheless there are enough reasons to get a separate reader .
The choice is entirely dependent on the specific use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for home a expensive gramophone to put on the new album of Maxim turbulenc . 
On a first music , such musical products are not issued on vinyl record , music , in terms of quality , there is no music reason for that to happen . 
If there is in your shelves of records vinyles crammed with the art rock, jazz and blues music, some hope at least likely to have such a gramophone.
So is the for on movement go music , that is to say compressed music , or simply movement music on MP3 . 
Again there are also categories depending on the price and quality.
For one , it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner for a reader , in the same way a fan of Pink Floyd would have a hard buying headphones being marketed for 20 market . 
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The long life of batteries is also crucial 
Some high end music players are capable of much more than reading playing music , but these are unknown functions , of course , in most of . 
No current apparatus is as universal as the telephone . 
In addition to the primary functions , telephone calls and sending , it is able to read music and films and record them , it has a camera of varying quality and can , for example , even serve as a GPS . 
And if we take smartphones and into account , you end communicators with a small computer in your communicators . 
Given that no cold storage can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
But the universal universality of the mobile is not without flaws . 
More the number of roles you use is high , more the interval between roles rechargements will be reduced . 
And the reading of music is one of goinfres most important energy . 
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours , in most cases , this figure is significantly lower . 
The music players (especially the rudest) are much more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobile , you can expect that they will only play music for a few hours . 
If you happen to call time in time, procurez-vous, to be sisters, a second charge for the work - this is true even for the more expensive.
This should be no problem for MP3 players , which , following a , are capable of continuous operation for at least 9 hours , including the less efficient . 
Another registration occurs in the mobile , during the music . 
Unfortunately , only a limited part of the aircraft has a universal USB connector , especially as not all aircraft be directly connected to the computer , without a aircraft software . 
We can clearly save music directly on the memory card , but few card readers know how to do it without reduction , given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile . 
Concerning the readers , you do not need , apart from iPod , any software . 
It is enough to fill , via the USB connector , the apparatus music from the computer . 
Most of the mobile and readers will themselves create a media library indexed by the name of the interpreter , the title of the album , the style , or according to judgement user's . 
Some aircraft only display an index with a aircraft structure , way Windows Explorer , others are capable aircraft both iRiver , Samsung , Sony , Cowon , aircraft phones with operating system . 
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile phones have more expertise
In the choice of equipment, intéressez-vous especially for life accumulateur, to the ability of memory, the quality and the kind of out of her and, of course, the ease of the contract.
If music is essentially background noise for you , and if during the day you are only going to listen to it for a limited time , for example you are on the bus , you only need any mobile phone that reads MP3s .
Almost all mobile phones are now able of doing this.
You do not even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read . 
All are able to read MP3s the vast majority of music which will get to you will have exactly this format .
It is one of the most prevalent formats apart from it , the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music .
The AAC format used by the Apple and its iPods is less common . 
For example , high end mobile phones also allow you to buy music online .
Since the of the mobile phone , one can just visit the web pages of the related operator or those of another supplier counterparts buy the song or album in question . 
This service alone should be a convincing reason to get a musical music . 
The offer from the operators is unfortunately wretched and it is limited , in most cases , to rapidly built radio facts . 
Prices are not that low.
However, we usually see this way to buy music (either by GSM, or by the Internet, or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people are always wearing their mobile mobiles on themselves . 
Whenever you want to listen to something , you only have to take the mobile out of your pocket , you have forgotten your MP3 player at home .
, it is also important if you always wear headphones or a handsfree with connection .
If it is not the case , you can use the bodies , that almost all mobile have , but a minimum of MP3 players . 
For many , the main advantage of music is their price . 
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand . 
For a price of three to four thousand kroner, you can have an already very good Walkman .
But in most cases , you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary headphones .
The price of the best phones and better equipped , provided with an entry for ordinary headphones , does not exceed fifteen thousand .
The readers , however , have the advantage of having an command . 
Really matter manages to ensure the of the most rudimentary matter which do not necessarily correspond to the less expensive matter our choice . 
A minimum of functions ; and the resemblance of the command with the post of a cassette , commonly used in the past , or of a gramophone , is obvious . 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet, trendy, by chance, followed by a piece of data transmission.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile , e . g . the Vodafone 527 generally have a slot card exchangeable memory M2 type , microSD , etc . . 
Even taking into the additional purchase of such a card , you will not exceed purchase thousand kronor . 
But be careful.
The basic models as a principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 principle . 
Only the most expensive fare even with 8 GB memory . 
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player , get a Cowon , a Creative , a Sony , Samsung , an Emgeton , or a iRiver . 
Depending on the max . 2 GB , you must not spend more than 1 , 100 kronor . 
If you're among part most discerning listeners , choose rather a specialized mobile walkman Sony part , Nokia and some Samsung . 
These appliances are equipped with independent buttons for MP3 , and the ease of use is closer to that of a stand alone MP3 player .
Sony Ericsson , whose Walkman series of mobile users have the same menu MP3 players sold separately , is the one who went furthest in this area .
The same service , in the same price category , but with a memory capacity up to 16 Gb and a longer life normally 15 hours , up to 35 hours , is offered by an MP3 player produced by one of the trademarks mentioned above .

The first virtual operator will win the to the Czech Republic this very . 
Maybe
The mobile market is relatively advanced in the Czech Republic, our operators offer virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, there is still something missing - a virtual operator, which would force the traditional operators to reduce prices.
It is possible that he won't miss for a long . 
We have already mentioned many on Mobil . cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe . 
The ČtÚ (the Czech office, which indicated that the price of an SMS was higher here than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed.
This is how , following the latest step of the European Commission in the area of step of roaming charges , a paradoxical situation could happen step sent from abroad will be for some customers of step mobile operators cheaper than in their own country . 
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic are still so high, compared with Europe?
The answer is simple , it misses a competition that would really wish to get into the fight . 
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks  and a penetration far greater than 100%.
On the Instead , mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive .
In this, Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Office of Telecommunications (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly said that there was no more room in the Czech Republic for another operator, agrees with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has apparently not much chance (now, it would hardly of frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a substantial reduction in prices , which traditional operators subsequently had to respond to . 
However , even before the entry of such as Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market , similar to those we now hear in our own began to be heard in Great Britain . 
However, it appeared that there was room left for such operators and that they could have a real success.
, we do not have to look too far to find examples .
In February we were informed of the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and to become the fifth operator of the country.
Let us add that behind Mobilking , there is the financial group Penta , which owns , among others , U fon in tchèquie Republic . 
The advantage of virtual operators being the ability to concentrate on a more specific target group.
For their operation to be effective , they really need far fewer customers than a trader classic . 
They are , indeed , exempt from the relatively high construction , operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network . 
, all over the world , virtual providers present themselves as low cost operators offering cheap calling and text messaging rates that are often counterbalanced by a limited range of services .
For example , Tesco Mobile , in Britain , offers text messaging at least 50 cheaper than its competitors .
However , as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows , to bet on an unusual target group can also constitute a good publicity stunt .
Indeed , this operator speciafically set his on men . 
"The real men choose mobilking - an operator who want, and that they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of mobile entertainment company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say , if such a concept would work here .
Miroslav Čepický , the spokesman for Vodafone , in doubt The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentaire approach , on which most virtual operators are based . 
Especially it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services .
No chance in the Czech Republic , say the mobile operators . 
However, it still seems almost sure that if they get a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
We are discussing the expansion of this successful success , but in the Czech Republic , negotiations are not success promotrices sponsored . 
The launch of mobilking will rather than in other countries in our area, "said in a phone has to mobil.cz Jana studničková, spokesman for the financial group pentabde.
She has thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were not in any favorable to this idea . 
Instead , they are trying to do their utmost so that a potential competitor shall not appear .
The GTS Novera group , which wanted to take a step forward in order to become real competitor for Telefonika in the area of customers company , has not , for a long now , been hiding its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator . 
We would very much like to be able to offer our clients not only telecommunications services for , but also . 
And the sooner the better.
We have already held talks about this possibility on several occasions with all the Czechs mobile operators . 
We managed to make progress in the negotiations with some, said the group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may be promising .
According to unofficial information, it seems that perhaps we could already host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"We do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is unique in comparison with . 
For the moment , no issue with a and serious seriousness in this area issue contacted us , Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of telefonika O2 issue , in his statement to Mobil . cz . 
Other operators also relate to the nature of the Czech market . 
The spokesman for T-Mobile Martina kemrová says in a rare agreement with the declaration of O2: "We have not recorded for the moment of viable project and bilaterally advantageous, which could be used."
And she adds: "It is practically impossible for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year."
To operate in such a limited period , we should have now a tangible agreement . 
Vodafone is rather directing its attention to the performance of the requests to get its own 3G licence . 
Miroslav Čepický said about this We are open to negotiations with potential online operators , and especially in the area of shared expenses and infrastructure . 
This is what , in our , is most contributions from the point of view of our customers . 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area discovery finding a partner to establish a common network for high speed mobile internet . 
The responsible authorities lies line the operators . 
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry to another operator would mean an increase of competition, would have led to lower prices and falling to their benefit.
What good is there in facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests , operators can be as thick as dodging . The harassment accompanying the creation of the U FON witness is an . 
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ , at the of creation of the U fon , has been that exerted by the company T Mobile . 
Witness of this is the publicly available information extracted from the Web pages of the ČTÚ.
Today, however, U:FON is ready to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noticed on this subject The competition on the market has been , most recently exacerbated by the entry of a fourth operator on the market . 
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT , it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would submit it , and especially its services , to high standards . 
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here , the indifference of the agencies seems disconcerting . 
It is not just the attitude of the ČtÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not, in the Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition.
This one belongs exclusively to the Office for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted, faced with this problem, his typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the of the necessary infrastructure . 
No such agreement was reached for the moment, because the supply of interested potential originally had not made enough interest to the traditional operators, "said in response to our question kristián chalupa of external relations department of Úohs.
A statement and does not surprendrait from representatives of operators.
But coming from an office , which must represent the interests of consumers and , among other also , be careful that no one will take advantage of its position on the market , such a statement is baffling . 
Especially since Kristián Chalupa adds Abroad , where there are usually virtual operators , you can see that their entry into the market has helped to lower prices of mobile telephone services . 
However pressure direction toward a honest of the pressure and a direction prices is apparently not part of pressure interests of direction . 
What is really shocking is almost tallies of the three mobile operators , which stems tallies their reactions . 
The question whether this is really a chance , naturally course . 
Similarly , a strictly equal price of petrol in all the petrol service is surely due to chance and competition . 
The office did not identify , about this matter , evidence of anticompetitive behavior , it has no reason to intervene in one way or another .
None of the operators has a dominant position , none has a corresponding responsibility for his behavior in the market .
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably the same as those for the telecommunications regulator , Chaloupa said in his statement . 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets drafted by the ČtÚ that telecommunications form a single market in terms of economic competition.
None of the Czech Republic operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some experts of the right offer a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it must get each time the consent of the operator of network.
And the mobile operator has fairly logically the monopoly on its network.
That's how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
But even without acknowledging this argument , it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are clearly proceeding in a similar . 
However, complaints of many involved people (including the already mentioned society Novera GTS) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all the operators.
Placing responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common in communications , through which the ÚOHS washes its hands of the . 
We have already seen this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
It has not managed to get in the novélisation of the law on telecommunications, recently adopted an enlargement of the powers of the ČtÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement.
This, the representatives of the Úohs must know it very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When watches is watching , it can 
That said , the operation of a kind of pseudo shortfalls operators , numerous in the Czech mobile networks , remain undetected . 
It is about business publishing their list price list of mobile phone business , but list price only part public . 
In most cases, it is a matter of firms handling the multi-level marketing.
Particularized mobile telephone particularisés are being proposed by Amway , Bohemia Telecom , particularisés and many others . 
The list of these firms are generally known only by members list 
The magic wand is in the fact that , to the operator , the company wand like a traditional client which is ordering a wand quantity of SIM cards . 
As an important client , she gets price and other special . 
The problem is that business conditions of all mobile operators Czech prohibit such a resale.
If what you suggest were to happen , we could be looking at a breach of contractual terms and could lead to a halt in collaboration with the company in question , Martina Kemrová said in answer to our question on this issue . 
However , it is rather unlikely that an echo of such an activity would not have reached from the mobile operators . 
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers.
No one , however , opposes such a procedure one 
Indeed, the activities of these firms are non-négligeables their profits, and in opposition to the virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own marketing official.
Miroslav Čepický points out the potential problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition , they are forced to admit that the SIM cards in their phones are not recorded in their names , so they cannot use them fully the same way regular customers of mobile operators can . 
, this is precisely what should seem strange to ČTÚ .
Moreover, there is another question for the ÚOHS.
If the mobile operators are turning a blind eye on such a procedure , why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ? 
He added that the Úohs has fairly broad powers to disclose such activity, and if it does not want to settle the explanations of operators, who said they had no idea that this would happen, their contractual terms and conditions the ban.
When we will not be the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times , the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has created a significant loss in the price of services . 
However , in almost every country where virtual operators appeared , the traditional operators were attempt , sometimes more , sometimes less , to prevent their creation . 
The arguments used by these were practically the same - too small a market, even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that intervened, in developed countries, regulators, who did not defend the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their clients.
As well by formal action by an informal pressure , they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator , followed by others .
Unfortunately , regulators Czechs treat this issue in the manner of a hot potato that get rid off by passing it to a near target . 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot shake the impression that the confusion in the skills in this case more than good.
But do not throw in the . 
If information backstage scenes true and a virtual operator will information be home scenes the Czech mobile market will perhaps information active movement scenes 
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the Úohs will hardly remain impassive face rejection (discrimination) other interested parties.
And we may cease to have more expensive than the rest of Europe .

The Sudetes demanded a referendum in the U . S . 
The Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 to include Šumava to the United States.
That stems from a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská Vědecká Knihovna The Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia . 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudeten Germans were supposedly addressing themselves to the US President with such a desire.
This results among other from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov in the letter beg the US president not to allow "šumavská župa '(area of forest in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood well the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops are coming on the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People that the fate of the Šumava take to heart."
Given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is allegedly promising, knowing the Czech National - that of brutality, attitude regardless, lack of understanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter calling on the American president to take in its hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
We cannot believe , that you would give this to a foreign state , that oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter million people who live there , is written in the letter . 
The supposed reason why the authors can not sign the letter is fear of the desire for revenge by the Czech oppressors . 
If the US president doubted the opinion of Šumava Germans, it would have to hold, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if its people wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text content in the letter can , given the current knowledge content post war history , seem somewhat naive , according content some survivors , it illustrates well the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the content . 
While the Germans Czechs were at least suggests that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic will be very few of them are avouaient such a possibility.
Some were waiting for America and Britain to get some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav chalupa, born in České Budějovice confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When , at the end of the war , he was captured by the English and placed in a POW camp in the Holstein region , dozens of Czech Germans came to speak to him he could teach them the Czech language .
They believed that once back home , the Czech would be beneficial to them , Chalupa said . 
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war thought , according to him , that he would be expelled from the Republic as a of the Beneš Decrees .

You do not consider - you pay!
An emotional campaign address attack drivers . 
The most expensive action road safety in the history of the Czech Republic.
A way of describing the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, on Wednesday, the ministry of transport.
The office of the minister Aleš Řebíček believes that she will discourage drivers of having a dangerous driving . 
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, on radio, in the movies, on the Internet, and also in leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from conduct from and drunk driving . 
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It is mainly designed to reach the conscience of young drivers , motorcycle , pedestrians , without forgetting the professional drivers . 
What will appear in the spots ? 
Above all personal stories that are going to attack the emotions.
For the entire campaign, "bloody" was also reflected in the slogan.
You do not consider - you pay!
The phrase You do not think is included in majuscules on the registration plate . 
Then, in a puddle of blood, there is the phrase "You will pay."
What must symbolize that we can pay with our life a moment of insufficient attention.
The spots are going to haunting viewers until 2010 . 
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo Saxon countries , where one commonly sees dramatic images of accidents . 
He believes that this will lead to lowering the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on roads in the Czech Republic.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and strategy against the drivers 
What works with drivers , is the system of sugar and . 
To them , for example , it really seems sweet to gain time when they run a red light . 
The Whip , it's the threat of a fines an accident . 
The risks have to be reminded to drivers , said Martin Kořán , the psychologist transport of the Na Homolce hospital . 
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, believes the psychologist.
The signs pointing out the danger to the drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
When a static panel , which warns against a danger is installed , it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers don't see it anymore said signala .

Olmert would give back in exchange for peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert , president of the Isreali provisional government , has ruled in favour of the return of almost all the territories occupied in 1967 , including the West Bank , east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria . 
He made that statement in an interview published on Monday in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth . 
We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians , which means that it will be necessary to give back almost all the territories occupied , maybe all , Olmert told the . 
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not happen," he added.
He deal that return possible would include East Jerusalem deal 
Anyone security wants to be safe in Jerusalem , and particularly does not want tractors and security to crush his feet , as happened to security of my best friends , will have to relinquish security of Jerusalem , noted Olmert alluding to the two security in the city , in July , during which security people were killed and dozens of people injured . 
According to the prime minister , it will be necessary to find a special solution for the Temple Mount , the sacred and historic sites located inside the Old City . 
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That will not work , he emphasized .
Withdrawal from Golan Heights 
Olmert also ruled in favour of the retirement of Israel from the Golan Heights , which is retirement according to him , an indispensable condition for a peace retirement with Syria . 
It also would require some efforts by Damascus.
I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of a pension from the Golan Heights , he signala . 
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They are going to abandon their current relations with Iran; they are going to abandon their relationship with the Shiite Hezbollah movement (); they are going to abandon the ongoing support to terrorism Hamas (Shiite movement), al-kaïda (terrorist network), as that of jihad (holy war in Iraq, "précisa prime minister.

Questions that arise after the accident Are because inside buses illegal ? 
The law is ignoring them ; walk in a long distance is forbidden . 
In the context of the tragic accident society Student Agency coach near Padua , Italy , the question has arisen of whether the cabin and passengers can move around inside the bus during the journey . 
If we wanted to respect the law strictly and formally , the activity of a steward is contrary to the road , said the spokesman of the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka . 
The accident, during which has killed a hôtesse aged 22 years, was apparently caused by the driver of a lorry which has come across the road to the coach.
The girl was at this time, unfortunately, seated next to the driver, on the seat the most dangerous of the vehicle, although it has available to her other two seats.
But the coach can have an accident or even slow down suddenly , also at the time the steward is serving coffee or distributing newspapers .
What matters is whether coach satisfies its technical by being equipped sheet places coach not . 
If this equipment for standing places is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long distance coaches do not have standing seats; that was confirmed by the company's director Radim Jančura to Aktuálně.cz.
"It is an issue that we have dealt with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of the passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we arranged for passengers to be able to go to the toilet during the journey on condition that they have their own seats , he said , revealing his position . 
The law ignores the steward
There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Steward no legal prescription with this role . 
On the other Moreover , no legal requirement prohibits a carrier from offering services .
The law relating to road transport only contain the term recipient law vehicle ; road do not define his her rights and duties law spokesman road adds with further ambiguity . 
Josef pokorný , the director of the Road Transportation Department , believes that movement at the vehicles director the law tackles the well enough . 
It all depends on fact the coach had in his approval permission fact offer places . 
lies lies in this , he says . 
Buses are divided into urban , where there is standing and a maximum speed , inter urban with standing and a higher maximum speed and long distance with no standing , the highest maximum speed and seats fitted with seat belts . 
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín , an expert at BESIP security road in transport , does not see security movement cabin board as a major security . 
With a movement , there is no danger . The situation can movement compared to the service in aircraft . 
But neither is it sure when there will be a turbulence and the air hostess can bang her head . 
"However, in the case where the coach would have slowed down briskly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in a city bus or tram . 
The carrier needs to manage the safety of stewards by internal requirements , he says , he also believes that from a juridic perspective , the problem is not settled .
Jančura is ready to surpress these services
Student agency is the only coach carrier that offers services cabin 
He hires two hundred of them.
Even after this incident, the Director does not consider their profession a hazardous profession.
"However, once I have the impression that it is a risky profession, I will suppress it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper upon boarding.
That would decrease the costs , he says .
Security concerns are the reason given by the Director of cabin Asiana Alexei vehicles for the absence of on its , which results in a very reduced number of lines in comparison with SA . 
"We have no receptionists. We are opposed to it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident , he said to Týden . years a ago . 
A great tragedy happened
A young hôtesse the Plzeň region , who had been working for the company for hôtesse years , died during the accident on hôtesse line of Naples . 
A Slovenian lorry probably left the stopping shoulder without using his and blocked the path shoulder the coach .

The hopes of the of düsseldorfois on Frankfurt . 
Big words were plenty in the letter sent by the steering committee of WestLB to the employees of the home . 
By a union of the entities the Financial Institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka Bank of Frankfurt , the central institution of markets of the group of the Sparkasse could be formed , according to the letter made public Monday . 
The WestLB would bring a "block of competence" doubled with a durable productivity in such a case.
All in all , such a relationship could be the decisive kick off for concentrations in banking land . 
That is what it looks like when a committee board wishes to demonstrate it's ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB , injured , is still under a of pressure . 
It is not only the European Commission , but also the Federal Authority of the Supervision of Financial Services , which only recently , made clear to the land of rhenanie Rhine Westphalia that time was running out in search of a future solution . 
But it has been an issue for some time already on Frankfurt's part also of some form of relationship between the Deka Bank , which is familiar with savings bank clients because of their investment funds , and West LB .
The head of the deta-bank Franz WAAS announced at the presentation of the figures of six months in late August that he had no sense in the merger of the House of the Mainzer landstrasse with a bank of land, whether the Helaba or WestLB.
DEKA's board which each half is borne by the Länder banks and by the savings banks groups , has instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with the WestLB , for common commercial activities .
It might be the flow of the financial market , or parts of it .
The talks, however, have only just started, one says in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the Deta Bank , which with its 3 , 000 employees account as one of the largest employers in the financial city of Frankfurt , comes into when there is talk of consolidation in the coffers sector . 
In 2003 it was believed for a moment that the Deta Bank could merge with the Bank of Rhineland land and the Halbab . 
nothing has come of this threesome .
The plans had barely been made public the government of the Land of Hesse said it was against any participation in them by the Hellaba .
, the two other houses did not join either .
The Bank of the land of Rhineland Palatinate was joined at the bank of the land of bade-wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there were always new negotiations on the reunification of DekaBank with banks Landesbanken . 
Finally, Günther Merl, president of the steering committee of the hellaba, had however spoken against any commercial strategy to merge with his bank.
Regardless of this , the feeling seems to spread that the amalgamation the different schools of the public sector is especially urgent . 
Now that the parliamentary parliament of the Land of Bavaria has occurred , a parliament of BayernLB with the bank of the Land of parliament Wuttenberg could materialize imminently . 
For the Helaba, this is not particularly a good news.
If the pressure that requires new mergers should increase, the potential partners are escaping him gradually.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far better withstood the crisis than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of savings and transfers of Hesse Thuringe , which owns 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba , has instead pushed a barrier at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB . 
Would remain if necessary the NordLB.
such geo strategic however reflect only one of the facets .
Another facet raises the question of how different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June , Merl stated that the crucial question , thanks by what business model the future capacity banks land should be insured , had not yet been question by the German Association of Savings loan payments question 
Eventually, a carve-up of WestLB could take place, carve-up which here is obviously not wanted.
It is also what it is in the letter of the Committee executive board in place: In any case, would be referred to a 'global solution is for the establishment.
How will all this be lumped together with the union of certain entities with the Deta Bank still remains to be union .

Sleepless disruption for shareholders in Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, the federal Finance Minister insisted only a few weeks ago.
What luck that the politician used the word relatively that he let slip that the German banking sector would not be spared by the movements of the crisis .
This has indeed occurred this weekend . 
The Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate HRE , DAX listed , obtained a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from turbulence . 
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters on Monday that the aid commitments are issued to a total of 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the part which it would be entitled to .
The money comes as much from private banks as from banks of public law.
In the background , it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses . 
The financial , according to a newspaper article , was very short term refinanced for long term projects for which he had borrowed money which is no longer possible given the fact of of the markets . 
In the first half of 2008 , reserve liquidity liquid had been reduced by 95 reserve cent liquidity 2 . 37 million Euros , the reserve rate liquidity capital declined slightly , from 1 . reserve percent to 1 . 45 . 
The current benefits the net ones from financial transactions have , compared with the same period last year , fell to zero , the benefits from the allocation of debt determinated securities the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros .
And it is only due to large profits from reimbursement of costs of accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group Depfa, as well as interest payments, according to the Book of fiscal procedures and purchases for companies to konzern that the deficit of the gains of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990 , the former financial state had initially mis speculated on commercial real estate loans , then had been spun in to the bank Aareal .
Because the classic state classic was not enough profitable , Depfa was then classic more intensively in infrastructure projects and in funding classic projects shared with private investors and État privat classic partnership , PPP and diversified internationally . 
On the value of the daughter company , Hypo Real Estate needs to proceed to , which should have an essential material which remains unclear on the gains and losses calculation of the group . 
The fact is that dividends have been brutally cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the takeover of the Depfa, an extremely important investor of state and infrastructure.
It is more robust than other institutes depend on the refinancing financing of the inter banking institutes because it has no . 
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks has again petered out considerably, the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part about 50 billion Euros of all the resources of the Depfa , a way for short term refinancing . 
According to a by Hypo Real Estate , need of the group are need by medium term credit and the company is protected from the influence need international financial markets which are largely out of work now . 
Other sources say that refinancing would be assured by funding funds to the end of 2009 . 
The president of the committee board of HRE Georg Funke explained that the group Hypo Real Estate should not have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Établissement for the Supervision of Financial Services Bafin assume that Établissement ability of Hypo Real on the market is now Établissement . 
Bank's shareholders and creditors just have to hope it.
However , given the momentum and the impondérabilité of the crisis , there is no certainty . 
, This is not unthinkable that the whole funding should not be used .
But the opposite cannot be dismissed either.
Given the fact that the bank was , according to latest releases , still at the gates of insolvency late end , evening temporary packages will not succeed in releases anyone's to rest minds . 
The share price has fallen by 75 to 3 . 30 . 
The bonds , however , are particularly well . 
While the primary head have barely budged , the of secondary loans sideline flagging . 
The most affected are especially investment funds from the former Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a life beyond 2009 . 
The obligations of the bank Hypo Real Estate appeared still now to be a speculative alternative investment alternative from now their value should be seen as dependent of the stability of the international banking system after the net tightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute who has brought the crisis into the establishment by the takeover of the bank Depfa . 
As the institutes, governments and commercial banks less affected are still prepared to support the system, we can assume a reduction of arrears in time.
Or it will happen that no one would hope at this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But faced with renewed noise of a partial nationalisation , likelihood noise sureté is now nationalisation a mere hope based . 
This should give nights disruption to all long nights creditors on disruption decision of whether they should secede from nights commitments disruption 
Short term investors term can still use what they have line of for postponement of reporting losses for the coming years of automatically deducted tax incomes from capital stock market .

Sylvana and the secrets boite Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop , 16 years old , has to introduce herself for the first day in the Highschool of Tachibana , girls are beginning to the German is so kawaii ! 
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows this word to Mangas in her new log exchanges , she speaks of Japan . 
The first day of course in Japan . 
I was so excited.
Already the way to go to school was scaring me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train for 40 minutes up to Tachibana Highschool.
I find the road alone, fortunately I am not lost.
The start of courts does not seem to be set as start as at courts in Lower Saxony . 
Pupils appear one after another from 8 o'clock 9 20 , a round table discussion with the teacher begins the home room .
But before the begins , it was my to introduce myself . 
I am not the kind who love to talk to people , particularly in of a class love 40 pupils . 
As I did not have yet the school uniform, I put an old skirt from my adoptive mother, as well as a shirt, long blue socks and black leather shoes.
In this dress so , I stand myself to the chair , and tried to say everything correctly 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana . . . ' I call Sylvana , I come from Germany and my birthday is next week . 
À this time , I was very pleased to have À to learn the language two years ago . 
The 31 girls of the class have all whispered , pouffé laugh made signs , and I constantly heard the word Kawaii . 
I already knew it , thanks to my mangas . 
It belongs to the essential vocabulary for survival of Japanese and means lovely , cabbage . 
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a great ironic smile , she felt that it was an honour that the had to sit next to her . 
The rest of the time has been relatively calm , but when the time music , I was properly rules time 
Everyone was vying with one another in pouffait laugh and asking me a lot of questions in pouffait laugh , it is quite difficult to understand the pouffait laugh . 
During the break, they have all taken out their Bento.
My foster reception had also made this kind of lunchbox for me it really reception something other than the miserable German snacks . 
I had some rice with fragrant herbs , some small sausages , a salad of cucumber and algae , fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by tofu . 
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
Things have a bizarre appearance and a completely new . 
What is certain, is that everything is really good.
Well , except maybe salty salt confites , Brrrr ! 
Bentos are not only lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a bento she has prepared itself, and who is prepared very carefully - in the hope to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I have read it in my mangas.
I am curious to know if I will be able to see it as well from here.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I have always answered .
"Because it fascinates me, what"
Ultimately, reading Mangas, this is what I prefer already for years.
And, in order to better understand the Mangas and the culture in them, I have also started to learn Japanese at a time.
For me, it was very clear that I would have to travel over there one day.
Because I have a weakness for traditions and customs .
And here, one gives them a lot of importance.
On one side, Japan is the country of technologies and the latest trends – it is tough, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organised, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."

Rats have also too 
A rat or a cafard flees before danger , does it mean that cafard feels fear too ? 
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings .
But how can really check whether it is feeling the same thing when it behaves the same way we do ? it 
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
Spiegel Online in a series of articles answers the question "What do you be true without proof?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now just as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that every human brain has the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species, and that we address the issues of felt or in general consciousness, we are moving into the difficult terrain, because the hardware is not.
When a rat is in danger , it does the same thing as many other animals it plays death , or attack . 
Human beings behave the same way , this is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective . 
However, I do not believe in it.
Two aspects of brain structure make the implementation of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult . 
One aspect is that the circuits involved almost always human conscience include the prefrontal cortex (the wing of its participation in the short-term memory and in senior management and delivery).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than among other primates and seems to be entirely absent in other people . 
At least for these of our conscience that depend on the prefrontal cortex , including the conscience of who we are , and the ability to predict and decide , it is reasonable to suppose that human beings differentiates itself from other primates . 
Another significant feature might lie in human linguistic nature a large part of its existence is linked to language , it often means that his conscience depends on it .
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language , it would influence it surely , so that the animal awareness , regardless how it is produced , would distinguish probably a lot from most of our conscience state .
It is difficult to determine what may look like the awareness among other animals.
If this , internal and subjective , can be neither measured , nor , because of this particular hardware , analyzed based on our own experience , then his observation poses a big problem .
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious , but next to this there is another aspect of the awareness that should be more easily scientifically accessible . 
One could examine the process of awareness of animals account of their content , and that's exactly what happened in studies on the memory of primates , particularly using the example of display 
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed , one focuses more on the nerve fibres of than on the causal mechanisms the two may be identical or not . 
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the display.
But what does this oil then for the emotions ? 
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
What we as fear is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain or its follow up , as the body's reactions grasps the live memory . 
As well observed, the emotions are closely linked to regions of the cortex that characterise the primates and humans in particular.
Subtle degrees of feeling sensation associated with our inconsatant nature , have been identified , because we can , with the help of words and grammar , differentiate and categorising situations to blame others than ourselves . 
In contrast , Antonio Damasio , for example , thinks that sensations brought on by primitive activities arise in the regions of the cortex and the brain stem relating to physical sensations , does Pankseep Jaak , who , however , focuses more on the brain stem .
this network has not changed much during the course of human development , it could have actually participated in any kind of transverse sensations .
From a purely theoretical of , I cannot contradict him , but I believe that undemonstrable . 
Pankseep argues the fact that what constitutes fear among men in rats is probably also felt as such in both cases How can one confirm if rats men feel the same thing when they behave alike ?
A cafard flees before danger , but what if he is fear ? 
À my eyes , similar is not enough to À eyes . 
Certainly , comparison help rats and humans possess troncs brain stems , on the cafards hand do not even troncs a brain . 
But is the brain waistline behind sensations ? 
And even if we could prove that for rights how could we prove show for rats ? 
I believe that rats and other mammals , perhaps even cafards who knows ? have sensations . 
But I wouldn't know how to demonstrate it.
And their feelings are likely to differ completely from ours since human consciousness is based on special tracks and on the language , I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats emotional sensations .
In all cases, progress poignent nervous on the plan as it gauges the same thing in rats and humans.
As I am not exploring the language and the conscience of rats , either the sensations , I do not know if these exist . 
We could see this short term , but I prefer going forward rather than constantly bumping into a wall .
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.

HSV wins fighting Gladbach 1 to 0 . 
With a goal and simple methods , the SV Hamburg takes the first . 
In Borussia , Luhukay still has not managed to find a eleven functioning . 
From Kristoffer Klein . Enlarge . Emergency landing for international player Marko Marin . 
The Gladbach player only returned late in the game , his high shot failed the rim of the goal .
His message was precisely shaped , it got out of his lips in a persuasive . 
He simply knew he was right.
We need this second goal , siffla Rieger Hermann in the corridor of the changing room siffla the Hamburg arena . 
There was little in the changing room, half-time was over and most were stale.
Rieger was the HSV for nearly three physiothérapeute ; he enjoys a great reputation like many of physiothérapeute former players . 
And this is why his request was received at strategic places.
The assistant Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and has given the boost to assistant . 
Cornelius is the brother of entraineur head , Martin Jol . 
Whose orders seemed to have been similar and how that up with the second goal ! 
The practice is missing . 
"Everything was not very nice to see today," confessed Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would "also have wanted to be more relaxed."
This 1 0 1 0 at half time , the team of Hamburg due it to strike successful head Mladen Petric at the eleventh minute ; and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not do any harm to Hamburg weak players . 
Ça was a dirty victory , resumed Marine Jol . 
The SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121 years this Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky over the arena, and the ranking tables on the giant screen that showed their club as the first in their class.
Il will be a birthday without real celebration . 
"We know to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He doubt that the intermediate outcome of the picture reflects more the unpredictable doubt of the outcome League than picture dominance of the doubt . 
The team with its lately committed entrants Brazilians Neves and Silva , the goalie Petric just like Jansen laid off from FC Bayern is certainly training quietly , but it doesn't shine yet . 
"We need more charm and more dribbles", demanded Jol.

fact conductions fuel soon frozen , the cryogenic death cryogène a conductions for her . 
For years , a mysterious phenomenon is causing confusion among researchers the anomaly of the support gravitationnel . 
The gravitationnal support is a space probes' operation , in which they get an extra boost in an astronomical obect's gravitationnal field , Earth , for example .
Thus , the sondes can save a lot of fuel . 
The Cassini Huygens americo european research used this trick , just like the Ulysses solar . 
Anyway , this is what surprised researchers for years the flying objects are not always behaving at 100 percent we expect according to the venerable gravity laws .
, discrepencies appears on the speed level
The sondes become unexpectedly faster or slower . 
Until now , physicists could not explain this . 
They named it the anomaly of gravitational gravitationnel . 
Some experts fear that Albert Einstein's theory of relativity , which described the strength attraction of as area to the curvature of , may not be entirely correct . 
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes iron that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the anomaly of the support gravitationnel using the so called dark matters that astronomers have identified in the universe . 
Black might be responsible for this anomaly , which is also located close to Earth , he writes . 
Researchers in the area of know about dark only for about ten years . 
It apparently emanates from it an attractive prospect whose effect is seen on other celestial bodies . 
It is however completely invisible , meaning that it neither sends out nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation , especially visible . 
According to calculations of scientists , the dark would still represent a non negligible fifth of the total mass of the universe .

A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and maybe soon for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others merely functional.
even some old taxi drivers and long time local residents cannot provide information to go to Extra Place , because they have never heard of it .
The street is located in the East Village and wanders through the north of First Street not to be confused with Second Street between Bowery and Second Avenue . 
About 30 feet wide and 120 long , it looks like a dusty poussiéreuse rather than an active lifeline . 
No signs indicates the streets . 
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street however has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place , and create a more fluid toward the and shops , which should open in the new buildings . 
Other admirers , including long time neighbours , have said to be charmed by this short cut simply because it is one of the last and oldest streets of the of houses . 
But the Department of Real Estate Conservation and properties of the city that manages the street , has properties interest in keeping bear . 
This month , at a meeting of the owners neighbourhood , representatives from the city agency and from Avalon Bay outlined a proposal authorizing the manufacturer property to buy the streets . 
But the committee prefers that the street remains in city's hands, and asked a new proposal to make next month, said Susan Stetzer, local manager of Committee No. 3.
"It leaves little room belonging to the city, and we would like the city retains extra place," she said.
They could offer to renovate and manage it , which Avalon could also do , but we want to maintain public publically . 
Avalon Bay announced months ago she wanted to repaver small streets and installing seats, some are also used by a coffee that the manufacturer will lend money space.
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele of Milly , door floor of Avalon Bay , declared that although the door floor to exploit the street , this does not door floor that it wants to be its owner . 
The main interest of Avalon Bay is relooker reconsider this abandoned and make it public , relooker said , stressing that it was up to the city to relooker the sale . 
Seth Donlin , a spokesman for the Preservation of Property , confirmed that the city really wanted to sell the street , stressing that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than to manage it .
Compared to its more colourful neighbour , Bowery , Extra Place has left a slight mark on history . 
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name 1802 , when the estate of the big farm owned by Philip Minthorne's many children was split , leaving aside this small peace of land , wich is still abandoned .
The rear entry of the CBGB , a punk rock monument closed entry 2006 , has reopen at Extra Place ; the entry is certainly more famous thanks to the coverage of the album of Ramones Rocket to Russia 
This place was magnificent , said Danny Fields , the manager of Ramones , who took the photograph in November 1976 . 
It was full of scrap yard , haillons , barrels , posters , leaves and yard . 
Some residents , including the bloggeurs who had already spoken evolution the luxury of the East Village , opposed the idea bloggeurs selling Extra Place , saying that this humble , little bloggeurs should remain public . 
Others have announced Extra Place as a true rareté a fragment virtually identical to the city that should rareté left in peace . 
Jeremiah Moss , who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York subtitled The Book of protests A Bitterly Nostalgic Look At a town in the process of Extinction describes the history of the City and Extra space , published in 1952 in the New Yorker . 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra place is a small cul-de-sac, narrow, dark day and night, and marked by the doors of a warehouse in rouillé and persiennes, full of newspapers last week which are soaring along the gouttières."
With few exceptions , the street has still the same pace . 
A agilement runs down the back alley , in of a door agilement was once the CBGB , which has now agilement the headquarters of a chic clothing chics . 
Graffiti on the walls , an empty 22 ounce bottle vacuum beer lies part to some newspapers that have just been thrown out . 
A few passers by said they only rarely thought about Extra contractors , and suggested its value . 
For his part , Mr Field said he thought some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state .

The Bilingual Debate Immersion left the English language . 
In this part of the programme of Supervision of Education , Bruce Fuller and Lance T . Izumi discuss the position of the candidates about the bilingual education . 
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you thought: why the middle classes should be able to choose their school."
favour over Hispanic voters is a complex complex . 
The proposals of Barack Obama on education are an interesting example.
The campaign of Mr Obama points out that African American and Latino students have less chance of diplômer a than white students . It is true . 
To fight these differences , the education programme of Mr Obama supports especially , among many other subjects , the bilingual transitional efforts for those who learn English . 
But the question for Obama is whether his desire to establish bilingual education which defends the teaching in class of languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating the differences .
Take for example , Sixth Street Prep , an elementary school of the east of the Los Angeles County . 
The students from this school are largely Hispanic, and with low income.
More than one-third of students, comprising many new arrivals, is studying English.
Of the CM1 students , 100 passed the review maths in 2008 , at the expert . 
Similarly , almost 93 of the students took the examination 
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient than the one proposed by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street on analyses , practice , a constant skills assessment as well as an practice attitude . 
In addition , and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy , reported Linda Mikels , Principal of Sixth Street Prep , this school has introduced the education of the English language using the waterboarding . 
The full waterboarding in English focuses on the almost constant use waterboarding English in investigation . 
Ms . Mikels , of the bilingual education , has declared we have had a tremendous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico , 12 months later , if you go to his class , you would have had no chance to identify him . 
This way , she , it worked for us 
Mr Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and repeat it in other schools composed mainly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves ; but the education policies within his party associations National Education Association has for a long supported bilingual education and his enormous support for bilingual education makes it difficult to predict Mr . Obama's response . 
Although he is in favour immigrants learning English , Mr . Obama recently seemed to favour this issue insignificant , when he proclaimed that favour all need to stop ranting about favour laws regarding the English language . 
Instead , he said , 'You must make sure that your child speaks Spanish . 
Mr . Obama really wants to eliminate the differences , he should carefully consider the education models that work , rather than disdaining them or considering them insignificant .

Eatonville , the first entirely black city to integrate , childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston , this description that she wrote in 1935 , is not so simple these days . The city with five lakes , three croquet , 300 dark foncées , 300 good swimmers , of goyaves two schools and no prison . 
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora festival that takes place each year at Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in different ways , the city that she describes décrit become a thanks to its inclusion in the décrit guide to Florida published by The Depression era décrit Writers' Project remains a place apart . 
It is as independent, dignified, and private than it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share its true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, does not know what he loses."
Even if it is the election year of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain wary of the view from abroad.
We are very careful about how to tell the story , said Hortense Jones , 59 , a resident and the city's paroissienne . 
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It is both a historic model of a takeover blacks black people and a community of nearly 2 , 400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average . 
This is a central point but also an example of rural black southist culture sudiste scorned , other times acclaimed reminiscent acclamée the birth of slavery in America . 
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville which started with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She hometown her home world worldwide through sincere , full of hometown books such world Mules square Men 1935 and Their hometown Were Watching world 1937 . 
Five paragraphs in the guide to Florida transformèrent this city , located right on the of Route 17 transformèrent a road that runs through the centre of Florida transformèrent often forgotten , which leads to a chapter of Black history and transformèrent human tragedy . 
Bold a bass drum in life in literature , Hurston led readers to the store property of the first mayor of Eatonville , Mr . Joe Clarke , which was then divided into several private parts .
go past the road on the left she wrote , you will find the modern brown left white public school , with its ordered gardens and parks game Miller has always taken care left , although he can barely read and write . 
She mentionned Widow Dash's new husband wrote that Lee Glenn sells any kind of drinks everything that can serve coming people .
So , in scarcely about one hundred words , Hurston associated Eatonville with a auto government but also with analphabétisation , remariage , and sex . 
Of course , Fodor was not this . 
This was not actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora has described the reality, "said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, a young girls Johnson that Hurston has immortalised, citing the songs without colour, interpreted by men who have recognised their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not appreciate."
You always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person , who was frequently coming back his family had moved to Jacksonville , Fla .
Augustus Franklin , 77 , rappela that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning rappela in a big Chevrolet , with a cigarette in her rappela and wearing trousers here where , even today , rappela are proud of traditional clothes . 
Many residents were fascinated , Mr Franklin said , many were laughing at her .
"People were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he adds further , balançant in his chair of the back patio arse got a balançant on Sabelia Lake , where Hurston was certainly baptised , balançant never stayed too long . 
On the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a star in the of literature , a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College years the 1920s , she was buried in an tomb in Fort Pearce , Florida , where she lived . 
In Eatonville , no great celebration , and no commemorative mark for the public . 
I do not think that they understood the contribution or the legacy that she left to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occured in the 1980s.
The civil servants of Orange County wants to make a motorway in five channels in town to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, Main Street in two ways of the community.
The development of Orlando has already extended Interstate 4 until the west of the city . 
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period of its history.
A forced integration, among many other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s , the dispute about the mix of races have led hatred to the of the community . 
At this , a bunch of young whites came to launch oranges or objects on the whites sitting on launch side said Mr Franklin . 
"A woman even died."
They threw a pastèque their car . 
In a letter from 1955 addressed to the Orlando Sentinel , Hurston casts doubt on the request of the Supreme Court aimed at forced integration , characterizing its decision in Brown v . Board of Education as insulting rather than glorifying for my race . 
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools , positive in some respects , has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakened the confidence of the young .
Black children were used to be embrassés I remember well we kissed our master in the morning , and embrassés the evening too , said N . Y . Nathiri , embrassés Dinkins' daughter as well as head of community embrassés Eatonville safeguarding , a non profit group . 
It has taken, she added, when teachers and students nor the same place.
You do not tone white teacher because he is blanc I mean that there tone here , a cultural line of demarcation , Ms tone Nathiri said . 
The civil rights movement , , helped make room for many other Zora Neale Hurstons black writers , actors and artists who moved beyond prejudice , she did , armed with cheerful confidence and personal mottoes such How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company !
It is beyond me. "
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the anonymous Hurston grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later , an acclaimed biography on Hurston carried out by Robert E . Hemenway , a real best seller , reintroduced her to the réintroduisit cannons in that . 
The project of the motorway arrived just when the most famous girl of Eatonville had found her appeal back.
this time , the old neighbours of Hurston regard her as a savior .
The community has begun to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this would motorway . 
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and many are returning in January, to celebrate it.
After many years , the contée rejected the proposal of the motorway . 
The fiasco of the motorway with five ways , very fast , a real pride ways Miss . Nathiri . 
Ms Boyd summed up declaring that Zora saved Eatonville . 
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non residents , such as Rachelle Munson , a lawyer who has come to our church since 1993 , began to come in large numbers , residents were beginning to reconsider the past .
Eatonville is classified historic town since 1998.
A single subject library subject name , of ouvra opened in 2006 , subject name magnificent , repaved repavé Boulevard . 
Today , Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida six miles from Orlando , it feels at time like an old fashioned back street on a rainy summer day , small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the . 
(there are today 90 percent of blacks)
Foreigners who come to discover story , its raison d'être , are still treated story caution . 
We must ask permission for most of the interviews , and some such choses the walls of Eatonville's old church , painted by the white men , man black men in the should not be photographed . 
Many in Eatonville , like Ms Jones , a courageous teacher with a soft for bright red , are still afraid that their island community is not well understood . 
However, given the festival Hurston expansion, a certain level of local pride appeared.
The young in particular , tend to view Eatonville the Hurston viewed her entire race beautiful , problematic , neither better nor worse , but proud , creative , bosseuse , crazy and mixed , just like the other ethnic and racial groups in America . 
It is sincere civic affection we hear in the voice of Mr . Franklin's nephew , Edwin Harvey , 18 , who expects to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police , which needs additional . 
And even the people , like Alondra and Alexia Kenon 11ans 11 people old twins from Winter Park , seem to have correctly learned people description of Eatonville . 
Most people passing through that area will think 'Oh , this city has nothing , compared to others' Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday . 
But if you stop and take time to contemplate history is a very beautiful city. "

Here in New York, all speak fluent finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan stayed far away from the newsstand and the giant television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
Never before they could not believe that in the offices in glass and nest of bee on top of their tète, bankers and managers of funds to cover that have a New York, are the worst 'working day in office since the fall of 1929.
Delivery livreurs continue to slip on the pavements , with their livreurs and their shelves of muffins for matinières . 
The Latinos still drag themselves along between the residential , like mules , with about 50 fancy shirts hung from on their shoulders . 
Office continues to be queuing up to buy their matinier dealers from , and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16h and 19h in week . 
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a account savings account . 
Fortunately I had planned to work in the late afternoon , because I discovered at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase , couple twenty people queuing . 
Neither in front of the cashiers' windows nor to withdraw cash or to make a deposit , before the customer service window , there where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks , tourists requested the directions for the Macy store , and new customers opened accounts .
Most of those in of me , I would learned that later from Starr , my personal allowed banker , were all queuing up for the same reason as me . 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies from the smallest banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from the savings accounts of called thrifts such as a building society , associations , and the kind of local savings banks and their subsidiaries which only function in a state , and which say they are treating their customers like their families 
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
These days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327 made use of the syndic bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers covered in the home for the week ending on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, the savings accounts with a value of $440 million, désespéramment sought a buyer for the save.
The bureau and employees shops stands in front me , bureau of employees potential shops have transferred their money to a bureau that employees more reliable to them shops the one which made most bureau bailouts employees Wall shops . 
The ordinary New Yorkers have become very familiar to the world of finance in the last weeks.
I heard a woman in my local Chinese supermarket , speaking on the telephone about Lehman Brothers , the bank that just bust , and his meagre CEO Dick Fuld , with the same familiarity that she could have to criticise a colleague . 
And Lyn , the doorman in of my building , has changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the shipments of my fruit and vegetable wholesaler . 
She said to me, after my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings in the monetary fund market.
"I have changed, I do not want to take risks".

Sangre de Mayo , Garci's bet 
Based on the stories are talking about our Benito Pérez galdós, José Luis Garci récrée the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre Mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmographie with nearly 15 million budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis," that he has always admired in the implementation of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of players.
The film Sangre Mayo that lasts more than two and a half hours will be released in cinemas next Friday and will become a TV series of more than four hours for Telemadrid .
Big fan of the literature of Galdós , José Luis Garci asserts that with this filming he has camera a child's dream thanks to Esperanza Aguirre , who asked him , three years ago , to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2nd May , something he has always accepted when the narrative stuck to the historical facts . 
The 15 million Euros provided by the municipality of Madrid are for Garci a unique opportunity to reproduce with the settings and clothing the atmosphere of a Spain which chose the wrong head the , since the fight for independence led the people to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII , he pointed out . 
But the filmmaker regret not having achieved a funding for the films' Captain Alatriste "or" the ghosts of Goya ’ – more than double that achieved for "Sangre Mayo ’ – as it has not been able to turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio valcárcel, with whom he worked for almost his entire career.
The director of Volver a Empezar has influenced his usual way of working , his staging of the actors , with whom he rehearses before filming , and his doing no casting , as that seems humiliating to him and he believes that the role of the director is to go to the theater and to movies to keep himself informed .
Many players in Sangre Mayo rehearse in of the camera , like players rellán , Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo . 
Nominated four times for an Oscar he has won one , Garci believes that the three films that represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy , Sangre de Mayo , Sept Tables de Billard Français , the winner , Les Tournesols Aveugles , are not representative of the young Spanish cinema , which deserves to be better known , he said .
Garci does not expect a from this price .

At the beginning you believe you are working for posterity , you realize you are working for prosperity , and now you are happy just to make one film more , explains Garci after more than 30 years of a professional career .
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of Seville sévillane Tórtola Valencia 
One Sevillian sévillane will pay tribute to another Sevillian dancer . 
Carmen tórtola Valencia , daughter of a Catalan father florenç tórtola Ferrer and an Andalusian mother Georgina Valencia Valenzuela , was born in the District of Triana and at the age of three years went on in London with her family . 
She was a dance free dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life as a pioneer of the liberation of women, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was vegetarian and Buddhist , plaida advocated the abolition of the corset which forbade the plaida movement of women . 
The life of this woman who left her in the history of dance in Europe between the two World Wars has fascinated Isabelle Bayón . 
I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to interpret the Seville sévillane Tórtola Valencia , and it seemed unbelievable to me . 
According to the dancer , we're not trying to tell his life to bring his thinking .
The titles of his dances made me spirit about flamenco . 
, the dance of the butterfly reminded me of a popular Cuban dance and the dance of the snake of some tangos .
Her sensuelle was sensual and they told me that my way of dance sensuelle similar to hers , she says . 
The staging is thanks to two outstanding contributions: Miguel Poveda who chantera new Isabela in one of his performances, as he had to "the Puerto Abierta"; and the professor Matilde coral, which has an unusually willing to cooperate with one that was his pupil.
Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature man . 
I am pleased because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me. "
The staging is also due to the composition of music and the guitares de Jesús Torres is paco Arriaga, to the folk song of Mr Ortega, El pulga to me Morón; the percussions of El pájaro, violates Rafa El Viola and collaboration of a player, juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the long-time companion of this kind of artists who were regarded as divas. "
This work tells , in a certain way , about the life of this woman who had exhibitions in such faraway places , especially for the time , as India , the United States , and Russia , but throughout Europe , since she usually lived in London .
I wanted to memorialize her because I believe that it is women who have an enormous influence in their time nowadays , no one knows values her body of work , affirms Bayón .
The show will begin at 8 30 p . m . at the Lope de Vega Theatre

America pleases less without Paul Newman
time God creates perfect people 
Paul Newman was a part of it. "
This sentence is from actress Sally Field , who has worked with him in Lack of glee and clearly illustrates the despair of the American cinema , and the whole of America , with the striking idea that Newman is not of this world anymore . 
He had a hard getting an Oscar 
He was no longer acting since 2007.
Everyone knew that he was ill.
It was a blow to everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford began crying, 'my life and my country were better, thanks to his existence ".
No one was afraid to get ridiculous or to exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and the country died during a particularly dark time , terrorists and stock markets are frightening , the Americans' self esteem has fallen very low , desperately searching for reasons of dignity .
When times are so tough without reason to live , only admiration is left to human beings it is not necesseary to be Luis Cernuda to like Paul Newman .
It was for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an enemy of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and defeated causes , like the foundation to fight drugs created in honour of his older brother who died from an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food . 
This was a victory for a country which has been struggling to assert itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expanding wave of admiration balayait across Hollywood without attention about the nationalities or balayait passports . 
The latest James Bond , Englishman Daniel Craig , has ascertained that no James Bond has died before him . 
Another Englishman , the Oscar winning Sam Mendes , said that work with Newman marked the of his career . 
The bad boy coming from Australia , Russell Crowe , dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration . 
"It has set the bar high", said George Clooney, which is perhaps the only today trying to penetrate the screen as Paul Newman: being very honnêt and privacy, serious and further goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle days . 
But there is anyone who tries , and Paul Newman is one example anyone 
After a divorce , he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward , to whom he was faithful even he if not lack for opportunities not to be .
"But why should I eat a hamburger outside my home, if I have a beef in my fridge?", he used to joke.
In the sky , he pride attends the his daughters' meeting with his fans on pride , something which is unusual in America pride 
Among all major roles that he interpreted , he was very proud to be the providing husband , the father in love , the attentionné and philanthropist grandfather , they say .

Madrid in the race for the of the 2016 Olympic Games 
And yes, the dream of many of us is for Madrid to hold the Olympics, after the failure in 2012, it could come true in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: We are not!
They call it 'the perfect race', but to me, it was the worst race in which I have ever participated.
If they had taken into account any mistakes that occurred during the race , they would have received mistakes note éliminatoire . 
But let us look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
The errors begin with the withdrawal of the dossards , which force you to go ahead . 
This is not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip to shop).
Well no
They made you go there only to get the players' dossard mistake , traveling travel for that and after a dossard queue surprise ! , there were only size S dossard second mistake jersey because I dossard a size XL . 
In what are we living ? 
Is it because of the economic crisis they have decided to shirts only tiny businesses with less fabric that are therefore cheaper ? 
Well , this is nothing compared to what happened the day of the racing . 
The fact that we need to go there very soon to withdraw the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and we must leave his bag to back at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes , which is incomprehensible 11 , 000 people are expected for these races .
Since there was a long line , the competitions started and we still had not left our knapsack at the entrance , although that was done , getting it back was even worse .
, the rain has accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barrack took place .
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow , and some people like me will not even be counted in figurerons classification with the exact time , because I think the chip they gave me did not mark the start . 
Of course , if they were asking me to cite one example of perfect race , this one would certainly not come to my idea . 
And I believe that we will always be able to of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games .

Microsoft is seeking a virtual . 
At the technology Émergentes conference on emerging , a new system Émergentes image recognition and human interaction has been presented ; it's a kind of technology Émergentes , not very smart but able to perform technology Émergentes basic tasks , such as calling call taxi technology Émergentes the Microsoft case , a shuttle to move technology Émergentes company campus in response to what technology Émergentes asked during a conversation 
Thanks to a camera and recognition of forms and faces, "while" can know how many people there are in place, which they are - including remembering what positions they are - and listen and hear the keywords of their conversations.
to pool them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video , the while detects a third person but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is speaking with her and that she is not part of the company . 
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him shortly.
All this with no blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus focus , for example on the next things of its focus system , Windows . 
This week we discussed about a strategy change at Microsoft .
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programmes.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft , version after version , has not stopped adding functions and perks to Windows . 
The strategy change is welcome.
Microsoft is right , its operational system loses value , but so does its software . 
When Google Chrome came to the network , I was one among those who joined the theory that Google Chrome was the first part for Google to compete with Windows . 
Several people have rightly pointed out that a Web browser is not an system . 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential base for the hardware and software to understand each other .
It occupies the same function that your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear but we must see the death of the operating system not as an absolute truth , but as a relative truth . 
Ballmer confirmed the idea this week.
People are less and less paying attention to the operating system but increasingly to the navigator.
We switch on the computer only to use Firefox , Explorer or chromium and every day , people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows . 
To whom do half the applications submitted with the system serve?
He who can do more, can do less
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much fewer than Vista.
Less heavy, less crowded, less complex.
For now , Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online online so that they ultimately become an alternative to Google . 
They desperately need this, indeed, and I'll show you an example.
The photo in this article , was taken at the of this photo in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft's employees photo in Redmond . 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster asks them to use their own search tool -- "Your research. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to seek information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or even in 2010.
Microsoft will surely start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, resembles a computer more and more.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, this will be expensive for them.

And if we try to list all its appearances , it could also cite the strapping moustachu which created the weight in a travelling circus . 
It is not simply swimming male body , moulant and sleeves . 
English people call it 'tank' the stunning Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others .
First , by his flamboyant name although he is known by the name of Marcel which has to do with sports because , according to legend , he took the name of boxer Marcel Cerdan , one of singer Edith Piaf's lovers . 
The Marcel differs from others in its excellent cotton , it its single sex , in its distinctive logo and in the small barely recognizable Belgian flag that these most well known have at the neck . 
But be careful , the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops .
But it also produces sweat boxer , old fashioned , cardigans in Kashmir , cotton boxer , babies , mini shorts . . . 
Clothes designed for the underwear comfort.
Even though it is a shame to wear them only as his underwear .
They have too much charm.

"I want to become a young mother; the candidate does not worry me"
Her huge resemblance to her sister has not prevented her to develop its own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who are lending their names.
She was present at the the Mango brand has done in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the price the most important fashion house that the Spanish . 
Monica is warm and timid.

I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have set up for Mango for the new season automne-hiver but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of 'mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera House in honour of Valentino.
A very intense , but at the same exciting , day awaits us . 
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season based upon?
The film of the 1950s and 1960s dazzles us and we film much from it for our collections . 
I very much like to trip around town and look at the women to see how trip are town , how they coordinate their clothes . trip do it town . 
Dancer , actress and dessinatrice , you are a very versatile woman aren't you dessinatrice 
I think yes everything is joined , and these activities have much in common .
Since I was very small clothing pleased me ; I desired to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and to see her clothes . 
It was brilliant, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of the way I dressed.
The dancers like a dress for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feeling good.
And in the role of actress, when you endosses clothing at this point that you really put in the skin of the man.
As a result , everything is connected .
You were not long ago 30 years old: Was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever , my 30 years of me . 
I think that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock do not scare me.
I have done all the things that I wanted to do I was very small and this has given me a lot of inner joy .
Then , do you think about becoming a mother ?
Of course, I want to become the mother because my body asks me and I want to become a young mother; I do not want to lose it.
Regarding the candidate, I do not worry.
What I will do is give happiness to my son and raise it with a great love.
Turning to the cinema, you look that different films that you made last year.
It is true, I am looking forward to them coming out.
I , who am a woman stemming from scene , am very anxious and worried , I scene like to have now but of course that is scene possible . 
I look forward to ensure the films' the última Hora and in busca the tumba of Cristo.
To see what you would think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell , did not you ? 
Don't say that!
I did not climb up the bridge to do the mannequin . 
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell has called me, I know for some time to invite me to participate in London a parade of charity for its association with the support to women and the clothes that we exhibions - I have exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were auctioned off to collect money for the NGOs to Naomi.
The people that Naomi is a person with a heart . 
They say so many things about her, I do know her, many things are not true.
Moreover, such a good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to for such a noble cause , but if she had asked me to do a , I would have done it anyway . 
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.

Repeat offenders of drink-driving will have to install the system 'alcolock'
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol , has to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the from starting when drunk , or if he does not exhale . 
The initiative was already announced last June, and since then it has appeared in the report of the Minister of State that this initiative is seen as a pilot project that will last a year.
His aim is the reinstatement of the driver by offering him rehabilitation aim . 
The State Minister responsible for road safety but also the General direction of Road Safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for the Security car take to this initiative . 
According to statistics , between 30 and 75 of motorists arrested for having driven more than once in a state of intoxication , car . 
The alcolock would prevent this because it is a device plugged on the vehicle which measures the alcohol level in the breathe and prevent the car ignition when the driver does not blow before ; or the driver's alcohol level is higher than permitted .
Its cost is higher than 1 , 000 euros and is at the driver's . 
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 indicated that the vehicles equipped with this system reduced up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain, we believe that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This itself to administrative penalties for two reasons to cope with these before they become criminal offences . 
And facilitate its implementation as judicial reform can be made in uncomplicated ways penal code reform , however , requires reform of the existing law .
The facility is not yet available on the Spanish market in facility commercial trade , although some industrial and office vehicles already have experimental experiments . 
Precisely tomorrow , the Congress members will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party , which proposes to set up in the school bus system , as has been done in France .

Talking in one's . 
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake telling us about something that happened the day before, but children who speak in their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but in reality it does not matter.
It is a benign distortion of sleep that is called somniloquie . 
It is quite frequent , especially among children and adolescents . 
It is sure that there is more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically once in life , for example , associated with an episode of life fever , or more regularly every day , once life week , once a month . . . , life day after the child does not remember nothing . 
There is no single which determines its appearance 
They are often linked to other alterations of sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors which were the night énurésies (out at lunch in bed) or the sleepwalking, but it is not always the case.
As we already said before , they can also be associated with very strong fever , with situations of stress or . 
way it is a bit studied . 
The intensity with which it happens is also very variable.
He may speak with a small calm calm , with isolated words , or on the calm with screams , tears , long speech . . . 
In cases where somniloquie occurs very frequently , it would be wise to somniloquie the child and to consult a specialist , to somniloquie if there is a problem causing a lot somniloquie anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem somniloquie 
We have said this is a benign distortion , so there is no treatment , unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated e . g . if it is apnée to sleep or to stress . 
What we can do is be account of a number of very simple preventive measures such account 
Try not to annoy the child before he goes to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent .
With very nervous children who death relaxing , relaxation techniques can be used to death them calm down internally . 
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
Once the somniloquies , try to stay calm . 
Remember they are harmless for the child and the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Do not wake him up.
It is useless because He is unconscious you would wake him up
Even if he speaks , he sleeps and rests .
Remember that if he feels very anguished several times , it is advised to consult a doctor or check what is causing so much anxiety to the children . 
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don't be tempted to question him to obtain any information.
You will get nothing , because sleeping , he is not aware to arrange his thinking .
Moreover, you hear what he said, but you will not know what it is dreaming of careful how you interpréterez information and conclusions you draw from this.
Never say to the child that you can interrogate questions during the night in to know his secrets . 
Not even in . 
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion , do not worry , this is nothing really villain , it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes .

Among the undecided voters, who are those who count, Obama has emerged the winner for 39% of respondents, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected from his running colistier , Joseph Biden , during the first and only public debate with his rival , Sarah Palin . 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts ", has, however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagénaire McCain has been putting forward its indisputable experience concerning septuagénaire policy , while stressing the naive of his opponent septuagénaire these issues which were in the heart of this first septuagénaire . 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and expertise needed to be president , has he also said . 
An line of attack teeth since yesterday in the Republican TV line . 
Obama has stressed that he represents the future.
Undaunted, he was concise and accurate.
It has highlighted his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
McCain hasn't understood yet , while Obama has though said this weekend , a Democrat tv ad , which accused the Republican not to have grasped the impact of the crisis on 'Joe the plumber . 
During the 90 minutes of the debate , John McCain had much to say about me , but nothing about you , Obama criticized yesterday , in of 20 , 000 personnesrassemblées assembled for an election rally in North Carolina in a driving rain . 
He has not even uttered the words middle class or workers . The rout advantage benefits Obama , who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the declining economy . 
"The coming week could be a turning point," said yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel , a former Clinton administration , compared the good economic instincts of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998 . 
For the Democratic candidate , the current débacle is the final verdict of eight years of bad débacle policy implementation by George Bush and supported by Senator débacle . 
Reiterating that he would manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the unpredictability of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois has also indicated that the achievement of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority along with the establishment of a system of health insurance.
McCain sought to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030 . 
Carefully , both candidates ducked the questions about the financial rescue package of 700 billion 470 billion Euro adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular .

In Minsk, "You have noticed that there was an election, haven't you?"
Young and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square in the capital of Belarus to reject the general elections results in . 
A few hundred Belarus met on Sunday evening the polling places on the central square in Minsk had closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the election .
While no results had yet been announced , many young people came to results against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko the dictator results resignation . 
Some admit to not even having voted What's the point , because will do what they want with my voice , a young says .
They do not believe that the regime which has been looking good to foreign observers in to resume regime with the European Union is ready to carry out regime democratic watershed . 
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarussian leaders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
We have been excluded from Electoral Commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting , lamented Yuri Potemkin , the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces , a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties . 
It is a cosmetic change , says Alexander Milinkevich , former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leader of the pro European , because the important thing is who counts the votes , and for home , it is the executive power . 
If members of the opposition enter Parliament , it is that they members been appointed , not elected . 
But their entry to parliament can mean area on television , meetings in the regions and some area laws . 
The opposition must enter the political game because "we must initiate dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and that we do not reform, we will be a protectorate of Russia.
we want to be independent .
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the election process will not recognize the validity of the ballot.
It points out that the figures of participation seem too high, and that voting in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all the manipulation.
You have noticed that there was an election ? the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline asks , one of the two remaining political prisoners released in August this year . 
There was nobody in the polling stations.
And there will be at the maximum five opposition parliament members , those best suit to power . 
The silence of the night falls back on the October place.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission welcome their success.

meeting Blood become safe again course 
Héma-québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation and its president, the Dre Francine décary, had reason to rejoice, because héma-québec became one of the suppliers to the more security and effective.
And above all, he has regained the public trust, which had been seriously dented by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know , the national blood managed by the Transfusion Service of the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus HIV and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s . 
In this tragedy and the public discontent, the government of Canada has set up in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Krever giant, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster again.
While judge Krever was tardait to submit its report , some provinces have established tardait committee aimed at planning a new system of tardait management in Canada . 
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee has fulfilled this term.
Following the gélineau and Krever reports , two suppliers have À created in gélineau Héma Québec to serve Quebec À the Canadian gélineau of blood to supply all the À provinces and gélineau two territories . 
In 1998 , when Héma Québec began its activities , barely 38 of people still confidence the system of blood in Quebec , the Dre Décary recalls . 
The situation was discouraging.
À strength of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we have returned to public confidence ", according to her before proudly say that in early 2008, nearly 94% of the population québécoise has confidence in héma-québec.
Dr . Décary keeps in mind however fact that trust is something extremely fragile .
Since its creation , on September 28 1998 , Héma Québec has applied the principle of . 
À this time it was in Europe to many of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says that is the strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we did not know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then relied on a key recommendations of the reports Krever and gélineau that when we don't know and that a serious blunder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by a degenerative brain leads inevitably to death, bringing in measures of exclusion.
So in April 1999, they refused the blood of people who had stayed more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has this shown us that the precautionary principle that we applied made sense."
In 1999 has appeared on the market a technique is much more sensitive HIV testing, testing nucléique acid (tan), which can detect directly in the blood of donors in the presence of the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which sat the tests used so far.
NAT allowed us to shorten the silent period , which extends from when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be found in the blood using our techniques , the specialist explains . 
One could reduce this period to less than a week.
We have this substantially decreased the risk that some donors are infected without knowledge and without possible . 
These improvements have helped to considerably lower the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today , one out of 12 million is put at of receiving HIV contaminated blood . 
"In other words, it means that 12 million of blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take over 24 years before that occurs a case of HIV transmission by a blood products.
I think we can feel at about receiving or prescribing blood transfusion to restore health , asserts the head direction Héma Québec . 
Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products . 
You never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island , which like the West Nile virus , is transmitted by an insect in the blood . 
We must always be vigilant , continues Dre Décary before emphasising that in addition to a security , Héma Québec must also provide an adequate supply . 
Needs are increasing the population is ageing .
The anticancer anticancéreux being more treatment , patients often need a of treatment blood cells or blood plaquettes . 
The ageing population also has implications for the network of blood donors who only 3 of eligible Quebecois to donate blood . 
Any healthy , aged 18 and older who meets eligibility criteria , can give blood every 56 days , or six times a year . 
On average, 14% of people who offer to give blood are not accepted, because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled in a country where there is malaria, they will be excluded for a period of a year.
With these 3 , we manage to maintain an list that meets the needs of hospitals . 
Shortages are very rare.
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and can no longer give blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donor.
Life today is so unbridled, one rarely finds the time to spend an hour giving blood," Francine Décary laments.
With an annual budget of 297 million , Héma Québec provides not only blood products , but also human tissues , including greffons , valves , the and skin which is used almost exclusively for serious burns . 
These tissues are analysed , processed and frozen before being stored at Héma Québec which runs the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec .
The umbilical cord which was once considered as a biomedical waste is full of blood rich of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks, the Bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and is predicted to take over one thousand per year.
We should begin to offer it for transplants at the beginning of next year , says Dre Décary who described this programme levy umbilical cord blood as very popular . 
Several grans are disappointed not to be able to have access to it , grans Héma Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and grans in all hospitals in Quebec .

Charest is betting on the north Plan 
The prime minister does not exclude to trigger elections before the end of the year
Immediately after the of the Liberal party's main council , Jean Charest came yesterday in Jean Talon in Quebec , where the new health minister , Yves Bolduc left , is trying to get elected in by election today 
"push the limits of our last great northern border": This is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, lévis yesterday.
During his speech , a of mill was projected behind pictures . 
Go loops, on three huge screens, clichés spectacular power dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google maps, maps, etc.
Great resources as in an election period.
, during the press conference , the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this autumn , although he pointed out that his time sheet was very busy .
The North "is the fourth part of a" vision "that the prime minister claims for Quebec, a new economic area", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the Ontario.
Often mentioned in the speech of the prime minister recently , the opening to the North the territory North of the 49th parallel had never been introduced . 
The prime minister , however , restricted himself to explaining why the North was a jewel with enormous potential , but did not set a deadline , figures investment or disclose the precise priority of the future projects . 
At most a few avenues which could be developed further notably power , the forest , but over all the mining sector , led by the growth of developing countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure . 
The North contains nickel , zinc , copper , platine , , money , iron , titane , platine even diamonds , according to Mr list platine 
This territory twice as large as France , it is in home , it is in Quebec . 
Not only is it home , but it is within us , he insisted , as if to show well that he was soliciting a national myth .
Quebec has much built itself in its relationship with the North , he said the gold rush in Abitibi , the québécoise engineering , Bay James . 
"We, our future", he added, having made a dramatic pause to contemplate the vast map behind him.
The North , 70 of the Quebecois , includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed , the prime minister said at the point . 
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border on which there is not an understanding for a very long border , when the opportunity arises , I repeat that border on the behalf of the government , he said . 
, with climate change , we must rethink our view of the North , he said speaking of the Northwest Passage , which is open all year because of melting ice .
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would pay great care to them that the project would benefit them , especially young people .
Two former ministers from two different parties , Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau a former member péquiste the Parti Québecois in Ungava , have already begun consultation with about thirty communities . 
A committee chaired by Benedict Pelletier and Julie pellets (transport and natural resources) has an important place has started work.
The prime minister does not exclude the possibility of a great meeting , not necessarily a summit , a moment where we will have a common vision .
The development of the North would beside be in conformity with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be concerted , methodical and environmentally friendly , he promised . 
Jean Charest described this vision as being in continuity with that of the liberal Prime Ministers who preceded him . 
"As the liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to transform the challenges into new opportunities of growth and development."
This has been a recurring themes at the end of this week, which began on Friday by a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage leading the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois plant to Adélard Godbout dam . 
From Godbout who created Hydro Québec , to Lesage who manufactured the quiet revolution of the nationalisation of power to Bourassa who made the Bay James , our party has been able to shape the future , said Jean Charest . 
As of press, he cited another reference, conservative, the programme "roads to the North" John diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
addressing the project of the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a Ruper , Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012 .
Ça remains between us , but I expect to be Ça , he confided to his militants , prompting home Ça applause . 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not eliminated the possibility to trigger an election this autumn, what the law allows him.
He underlines that his schedule is full , especially by a Federation Council's mission in China and a summit between Québec and New York . 
The general council of the weekend has given the Liberal leader a platform containing resolutions nationalists, in the 'constitutional aspirations, "which have gone as a letter to the post: the plq calls, especially the recognition," the specificity of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also hope that the Quebec called the council members of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications and that they have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the side of the opposition , the outlines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism . 
The head Péquiste , Pauline Marois , has brought forth again the for the development of the Nord du Québec that the Landry government launched in 2001 . 
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, has renounced to apply it.
If he had done, "it would be more advanced today," commented Mrs Marois alongside its candidate in elections Jean-Talon (today), Françoise Mercury.
The support said it supports government of the Northern Plan . 
But what we hope is that it will not be just a spectacle , commented leader Sébastien Proulx , replacing Mario Dumont , who is returning from holiday today .

Letters A disgraced country 
It is Mr Vic Toews , former 'Justice' Minister ironically in the Harper Cabinet , who last summer made bold to say about Louise Arbour that she was a disgrace to Canada . 
And the cast aspersions on this woman who has conducted an unending struggle for justice and deserves admiration as said so long on the entourage of Prime Minister on Stephen Harper itself.
We are facing a government which is the only one , of all the Western countries involved , not to have brought back its couple locked in the concentration camp of Guantánamo . 
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at that time he is accused.
The only government that , despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention , denies his own floor and leaves a child soldier languish in inhumane conditions . 
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused travesty 
Remember, remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadr, so that he has a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government which condone torture: not matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps for ever, after years of abuse.
It does not yet, but we are currently undergoing a rampant erosion of our rights, our freedom and democracy, the word that Harper continues to hold and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Now is the time no moral no longer exists we can bully , torture , arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a government leader so far in the minority as will be then after October 14 . . . .
A of voters believe that they will find salvation in a which extols virtues , law and order they do not see that this government has abandoned the of our country's reputation and dignity . 
The shame , Mr Toews , it is here , in this shift , and not anywhere else .

Free opinion Barrick Gold's orwellian speech 
In its edition of September 17th , duty Devoir published a letter from Mr . Patrick J duty Garver , Deputy Director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold . 
Pursuing an Orwellian approach, he says that the biggest airline gold of the world has brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent" public debate.
it is true that judges are independent and impartial , it is not the truth that they judge , especially in the case of libel prosecution , but the law .
Not surprisingly , this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr . Garver . 
Because , for Barrick Gold , would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position to its hers ? 
Whatever the outcome of the trial , the authors and the editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and to fight , arms quite unequal , against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining . 
The tactic , in these uneven struggles , is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a gentle settlement which bâillonnera opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to re examine the issue . 
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate , it is before the public that it public had to present his vision of the facts public 
Contrary to what happens in several of the countries in which Barrick Gold works , debates in Canada are normally exchange of ideas and not clubs . 
It was enough for the mining to open its books and its and to establish a real debate , through newspapers , the media , publications and with funding for independent research teams that could shed light on the issue . 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects dismissing the petitions and letters of support from black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how it can request a "public" in which the views of the public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word only means highly paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What does not understand or does not want to understand Barrick Gold , is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it primarily because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining . 
The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but based on the exchange civilised arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a poursuite-bâillon (with the "public debate," Barrick Gold has also lodged a formal notice of the authors of black Canada but to stop the use of this term...).
surréel Mr Garver's surreal speech , continuation Barrick Gold is a surréel attack against freedom of continuation research and the pursuit truth , which are essential to continuation democratic society . 
She denies, part of the right to the quote to credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations, which represent the backbone of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and to discuss issues that do not like the rich companies in this world in a country like Canada , for fear of repeated rehearsal , who will be able to do this ? 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public and transparent debate , she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada . 
She has a right to reply . 
The academic world, which we belong, has long known to manage the debate and dissent and resolve conflicts.
The excessive legal proportion by Barrick Gold clearly shows that , contrary to proportion it claims , it has no desire for a proportion . 
This is a loss for the academic world , it is for public debate in Canada ; and it is time for governments to establish regulations limiting these kinds of malicious lawsuits .

Operation Rescue for Wall Street – Democrats and Republicans agreed
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion dollars plan aiming to curb the financial crisis affecting Wall Street for dollars has yet to be approved by both chambers of dollars Congress . 
It includes: better control by members of its implementation of new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money involved, new provisions to contain the number of foreclosed homes in default, as well as an influence on the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , president of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and the president representative at the table , Senator Judd Gregg , announced president good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday , president marathon negotiations lasting two days . 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement which will be effective on the markets," declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
Everything was done in order to the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis in Wall Street , said the Democrat . 
"It is the fundamental point: If we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The talks had turned into a sprint in the last few talks by fear of the effect that would cause another talks on investor sentiment . 
The limit that was agreed upon was the opening of the markets time limit . 
Brought into the negotiations late , the two US presidential candidates were rather favorable to the agreement , without failing , however , to express their dissatisfaction that it had to come to this . 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has blamed the addition of certain provisions in the agreement , particularly the proposal to allow homeowners to keep their homes that the pay of executives of companies rescued by the state .
When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some , there is to be proud of . 
But these measures are necessary , he commented on the airwaves television . 
Questioned on another chain, on whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
The lines that I have read that it lines something that we will all have to digest and lines which we will be able to move forward . 
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, he said.
The 700 billion plan to buy up with taxpayers' money the bad debts , risky and unsellable assets of the American financial institutions . 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of the real housing bubble which first led to the collapse of sub subprime mortgages before spreading to other , more widespread securities of credit pcaa commercial ABCP and leading to a liquidity exodus and the of banks and financial institutions . 
It is a group of elected Republicans who had killed the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed we are out of this impasse since Democrats have agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies in trouble are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to cut corners for everyone in Congress , they have also added a provision stipulating that if the government should take losses for five years with this programme , it could put in place new taxes aimed at helping recover its implementation . 
The new plan provides for a first tranche of $250 billion that will add another 100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be ratified by another vote in Congress.
In exchange for its assistance , Washington will receive shares in the rescued companies which will pay dividends in case of profit and which it will be able to sell when the storm has passed .
The federal government will take the opportunity to delay the procedures of foreclosures on homes attached to the real loans covered by this plan and set limits on pay and redundancy payments paid to executives of affected companies . 
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted for a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
, voices continued to be raised yesterday against this project , both on the Republican and Democratic side .
"Obviously, Washington did not intend to," said to his constituents, the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the finance committee of the house.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one which consists in taking advantage of taxpayers".
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed "the caucus of sceptics", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: we are asking the Congress not to hurry and to carefully consider the way to follow", he said yesterday.
Meanwhile, in Europe, we had once again the proof of the crisis' global nature.
At the end of an emergency meeting , the three countries of the Benelux announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11 . 2 billion euros 16 , 3 billion Us . 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg had become necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was abandoning the acquisition of its drowning rival since it lost 2 billion Euros 2 . 9 billion US during the mortgage crisis in the United States . 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of 20 major European banks and the ten biggest insurers.
This is not wasted money , said yesterday the Dutch Finance minister , Wouter Bos . 
In exchange, they get a vote in the bank and influence.
This is precisely something that savers and households enjoy now that the time looks uncertain."
Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seemed on course to nationalise another bank mauled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government will resume his account of all the loans at the bank Bradford and bringley, more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US) of mortgages.
The Spanish bank Santander made it known yesterday that it would buy the branches and the customers of the British bank . 
The Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.

Paul Newman (1925-2008) - death of a committed icon
Her blue eyed beauty eyes her card for a long , some eyes say her weakness . 
Had he freed himself from the narcissist's mirror narcissique the American player the charming charmer 
Yes and no.
His modesty , his sensitivity and a talent which was obvious also have taken him cry from the register of power that is giving rise to the real sacred monsters . 
But what a great long substance runner ! 
Paul Newman , deceased on Friday , at 83 years old , because of a lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut , remains one of the last of the American of the prosperous years . 
Less monumental than Brando , to whom he ressembles and was a long rival on the screen , more cautious in his game , certainly more fragile , but also a great champion of freedom and the bursting of dramatic conventions . 
Mixed blood often brings forth beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 , of a German Jew and a mother with Hungarian origin . 
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without huge egos , the ultimate mark of quality . 
Because was projected in him a whole country in love with the self made man , the Pacific war fighter , wounded in action , who in the early 1950s studied theater in Yale and attended Actor's Studio in New York , before succeeding at the theatre , television , soon in movies .
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the pilot cars , who came in second at the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979 , and was a sex symbol , albeit member of a model couple together with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 .

What could anyway produce Zuschlag company ; Cie in their bills factory ? 
Soon , on the 8th of October , will start the proceedings concerning the ongoing criminal process underway against János Zuschlag and his accomplices . 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud in the form of organisation and regular criminal , having led damage rather sizable . Other charges have been brought against them , such as and use of . 
According to the public prosecutor, money from subsidies, was spent for personal gain, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the État and municipalities, approximately 65 million Huf in total, was in the coffers of the movement Fiatal baloldal and, in the pockets of some people.
Their method, made public by the authorities of the inquiry, was to touch the money subsidies received by issuing bills of expenses, behind which no real provision was given and the associations have never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were forged.
For the latter , they obtained invoice bills at the Józsefváros market , while they produced the stamps bills Kiskunhalas . 
As for the names of societies that were included on the bills, they were decided, among others, during tours in the province of North Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, on the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter , he was supposed to identify pensions and restaurants . 
For his personal consumption , he called for a bill , modeled on which they wrote other bills that they would introduce , among others , in the Ministry of Youth and Sport , the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour , as well as the capital access get grants . 
The majority of bills was created by István lados and his accomplice Mr András Őri who , according to our information , was involved in files drafting needed to qualify for subsidies . 
During a circuit spot one of the choice of Lados was a bistro . 
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003 , this place has assured the restoration for a group of 90 people , members of the Biztos bridge Egyesület association . 
However , according to what the manager said , it would have been impossible that so many people fit in this place , at the same . 
Similarly , during summer 2002 , the bill on behalf of Jobb Jövőért foundation which will bear the name of Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért , grouillait full of form and content . 
A pension , located in Badacsonytomaj , had in fact only three rooms , a maximum of ten people could spend the night there . However , the bill was mentioning one hundred thirty clients .
Invoice providers with overflowing imaginations plunged into excess , when they said that the company Pigal KFT also belonged to the HORECA sector . In their accounts , or the name of Jobb Jövőért nor that of Hoppá appears , according to the information given to the prosecution . 
Győző Farkas , the manager of the society , said to the site hvg . hu that when society public prosecutor summoned him and showed him the bills society he knew immediately that it was . 
The name of our society and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp . 
He added: "beyond the fact that after the bill, a hundred people were housed there, not very truthful headline either, as this has only 11 bedrooms, which were not so much space.
, the also mentions meals too , and our restaurant is closed since long ago .
Issuers of bills accomplices were not informed on the travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but only organising trips abroad. Thus, naively, they said residency in Hungary on bills to pay in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Also , as it emerged during the investigation , they also added VAT on these documents , while the benefits on the travel activities , which the is outside the European Union , are charged without VAT . 
Similarly , the VAT rate of the four bills made out in the name of the Hotel Révfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect , because the company's allowances do not cover a VAT of 25 as indicated , a VAT of 15 . In addition , employees of the hotel issue only printed bills , while the false ones were made out by hand .
The prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "Issuers have also made mistakes, stating that provide the Road Haulage, that the company issuing bills could not exercise, given that his profile was the council in investment.
, it is also for procedural defects , such as inadequate kinds of bills and false stamps , that bills issued by Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány , of XXI . Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont turn out to be wrong .
As in the case of society Ravenna bt. or sporting kunfehértó internship, who both deny perpetrators of invoices in their name.
Counterfeiters have not paid attention to the fact that society Hib KFT., established in nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (2001) the group of Fiatal városért egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. Our information, this is why the liquidateur of the company denies having made this bill.
Invoices set deliberately 
Another group of issuers of bills was composed of those group were fully aware that they were being asked to issue false group . 
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation , at the request of grouping Fiatal Baloldal Ifjú Szocialisták , wrote an bill to the of the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation , for a sum of four million HUF . 
According to the indictment , the manager of the society Collab Kft . was asked to issue false invoices society one of the accused , Ludovic Györfi . 
Similarly , in cooperation with the Zuschlags , the company Biogate Kft . , which is currently under liquidation which in 2003 issued bills to the order of the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation , the Atlasz Egyesület association the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association , amounting to around five million HUF , for which no services have been rendered .
No financial movement took place , either , given that the invoices were cancelled result , but the organisms bodies carefully to mention this in their accounts . 
The following group of companies which issued bills is that of companies directly linked group the accused . 
, the administrative deputy to the executive director of the Delta Trió KFT . enterprise which trades in fuel and cars , whose headquarters were located in Budapest , where he was nowhere to be found , was Iván Kubatov .
In October , November and December of 2005 , this company has issued several bills for the sale of computer equipment , sum to about 18 million HUF . 
According to the investigation , such equipment would have been purchased by the company Cash Investment kft of Kiskunhalas , which was in since September 14 , 2005 . 
This company's director was a man from Romania , whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents relative to connection company society between 2002 and 2005 . 
According to what we know , Kubatov acknowledged during the inquiry that he issued bills on the order of the Atlasz , Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány companies , and that he pocketed their equivalent . 
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian builders have created the Fa Bani Jos Faipari Kft . and Jos Investment BT companies . 
In fact, none of these companies worked, that the accused is that they did not receive work.
He served when even those companies, because at the request of maestro Zsolt szente, coaccusé as well as editor of corporate foundation, established the Bills to their names, the order of associations with Zuschlag, as the associations atlasz and y-generáció.
Kubatov gave a bodies of 15 bills , issued by the bodies Investment , Delta Trió , Fa Bani Jos , bodies Investment and Linaxtrade companies , with a value of 14 . bodies million HUF . 
The public prosecutor believed that 10 of the pointed on the bills as well as VAT were going in Kubatov's pockets . 
The man even used the Szi Beri Bt . company to establish fictitious bills that were used as part of the request for a subsidy for Biztos Pont . 
In January 2006 , the Y Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant from the public utility body of the socialist party , Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány MRI . 
They have achieved this subsidy for the amount of twice 500 Huf , but these amounts were amount used for the objectives pointed in the demand . 
In order to prevent it from being known , five bills received from the Works Team Kft . company bills been presented to the TMA . 
Moreover , these are bills that have been found during the raid on the office of Árpád Kemecsei , the Minister of Education . 
At the hearing , part of the accused relatera explain bills production method , as it had relatera done in of the public prosecutor earlier . 
What could be really interesting would be that the main , János Zuschlag himself , decides to lift the veil on the whole history . 
Until now , his admissions are not very detailed , and although he has admissions repeatedly to tell the detail , he has not yet done admissions . 
The question is whether it is in their interest , perhaps eventually the Socialists would together conclude that in exchange for reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF , Zusi would wear only the hat .
Today, this one is probably annoyed, since the requests for his placement under house arrest, on a basis of a reduction of its detention conditions, keep continuing to fall in deaf ears.
While those who have caused much more important damage , and the authors of irreparable economic crimes , walk freely or at the least , await in their own home the end of the procedure . He does not have this possibility .

The psychology of the bidding war: why do we spend more money?
At auction , buyers tend to spend more , and overestimate auction commodity . 
The researchers in neurology and economy of the University of New York managed to update the neural and economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be outbid in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, which is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These studies have tried to set a neural pattern of this kind of "game" with the help of auctions experiments.
One of the groups of volunteers playing the lottery, while the other group was involved in an auction playful, while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), the researchers analysaient brain areas of the experimental subjects.
In both games , the participants could win money , but during the auction whose a key element is higher surfeit by a third , all the situated under waistline brain , called striatum , were intensively crash at the loss of the part . 
This part of the brain, in addition to having several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why , according to researchers , the rise in prices is explained by the brain researchers the violent reaction of the striatum . 
In support of their theories , the members of this group of researchers have pursued analyses of financial supervision . 
During these, three groups were outbidding facing a partner, in various circumstances.
They have simply informed the control group of the real value of the product in question , and they have made their bet .
To another group, they promised that if they came out winners of the game too, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group has received the $15 before the auction, but the group also lose money if they lose the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was put in on victory, while another, on the failure.
By demonstrating the assumption of neurologues , members of the against failure players team were willing to higher than those made by the control group and the for victory group . 
"These results cannot be proven by any economic theory that already exists.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena noticed during auctions by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only the neural imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories, leading on a third explanation. "- found Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.

Hepatitis: when do we have to see a doctor?
In the world, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
An estimated 100 miles patients infected with hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles following treatment. This is the fact that often patients do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infection affecting the liver and caused by different virus . 
There are many similarities between their symptoms . Inflammation of the liver and jaunisse are characteristics , but the pathogenic pathogens and the disease caused differ from one another . 
The virus , in the of pathogenic genes pathogens spread mainly virus two forms hepatitis A and pathogens through the virus tract for example contaminated food or water pathogens hepatitis virus , C , D and pathogens other virus blood and organic liquids sperm pathogens vaginal virus . 
For passengers , it is anyway recommended to be vaccinated against the passengers and B virus . There is no vaccine against passengers C . 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated feed , in most , accompanied by poor general state , weakness , upset stomach and nausea . 
Then there develops on the skin and white of the eye a visible yellowing , the faeces become lighter in colour and the urine , darker . Recovery could take two to three weeks . 
Throughout the world , every year , a million people die of the most serious of this disease , as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B . 
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one patient out of ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know they are infected by the virus , because the pathogenic gene silently destroys the liver cells . In many cases , the first symptoms only appear after 20 to 30 years .
Consequently, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than average among a population of three groups those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991 , consumer and drugs who have tatoués . 
Currently , we figure 200 million patients suffering from type chronic hepatitis C in the world . 
Since the disease can be detected by a routine examination in a laboratory , it is advised to examination doctor attending from observation of unknown origin examination . 
The disease can be cured , if it is detected in time . The virus can be eradicated from the body , this the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is averted . 
On 30 September is the world day of hepatitis , organised for the first time in 2004 by the bodies representative of patients corners around the world . 
His aim is to draw attention to the liver cirrhosis has got a chronic, caused by viruses, on the causes of its development and on the importance of the early diagnosis of illness.

Does who believes in God feel less pain ? 
According to the results of recent research , religious beliefs as a kind pain reliever , which would have already made the of the death martyrs more bearable . 
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article stating that researchers at Oxford University have had an interesting experience analyzing at what level the belief in God could influence tolerance to pain in human beings .
As part of this experience for the bizarre 12 Catholic believers, and as many atheists have been subjected to electric shock treatment, while each of them from a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the faithful Catholics have been able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique palpation the human brain , we were also able to discover palpation Catholics had been able to activate the part of palpation brain responsible for regulating the pain . 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments , to which academics , scientists , philosophers and theologians take from different sectors of the university . 
Specifically , the experience is as follows an instrument that emits sparks and broadcasts the electroshocks is set on the left hand of the experimental subject . 
Researchers asked the participants in the to experience looking for a long at two paintings , one being experience Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in experience 17th 1600s and the other , the Lady in Ermine experience by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th experience . 
origin who initiated this experience hoped that the sight of origin Virgin Mary tells a kind of state of faith origin the believers , while the choice of Da origin painting , not very different from the first , origin on its calming effect . 
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scan, and during this time, received 20 ect four part is a worthy successor, watching the paint religious theme, the more general.
Catholics have said that at the view of the Virgin Mary , they felt safe view like someone who is taken care of and they calmed down view and peace invaded them . 
At the sight of the painting of religious themes, they have reported a 12% of pain in less than when they watched the work of Leonard.
Psychologist Miguel Farias , who took part in the experience himself , believes we can achieve the same effects for atheists with some other of powerful image , provided we find the appropriate photo . 
"We should find a picture toward which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, has welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, changes effectively our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results , all that remains is the question of the effect on the pain regulation of the issues if believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by another painter of the same ? 
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary yield better results

You are what you disclose about divulgues 
In the tenth anniversary, Google says that we can find at the bottom of the pockets of people as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their summer holidays, which experts they look and what their interests.
This is still not enough , according to Eric Schmidt , who is one of the influential people in the society . 
While as to the sceptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's vision of horror , they do not properly see the bulk Web 2 . 0 . 
Eric Schmidt said , not long ago , to the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users . This is necessary so that Google's founders can keep to their original purpose which was as follows Let collect all the information in the world in a system ! . 
According to the leader of Google who was interviewed , after ten years of leader chamboulement world , they are still only at the initial beginning leader their targets of being able to deal with all leader information . 
The question: what will be in five years ago? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can answer questions such as "that I could do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that I would be better?". However, software can only respond to this type of question, simple at first sight, as when they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used performing Internet searches , the IP address of the computer that launches a search and the pages which are then consulted by the people involved are precisely recorded .
Through the programme personalized search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own historical research and can see what they have sought, what they have cliqué. Through this long-term recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to give much more intimate, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences.
What happens if someone is using my data against me, if it looks at what is my job? asking users, who worry about seeing the monopoly of information to Google.
In most cases, it is the power potential represented by society, which can cause of fear, and this is not the remorse, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can arouse a contre-réaction Internet users.
It is , however , a known fact that the terms being sought are not only registered , but in some warranted cases , they are sent to a third party , in this type of case law , nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users .
The most resounding of these days is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles , days which Google has sent the Brazilian government information days was collected on the public page called Orkut days thereby allowing identification . 
Internet users concerned about human rights could heave a sigh of relief last May , when Google , arms in disarray with the body of legal electronic protection EFF , has proved its right to the court in of the FBI . According to the pronounced ruling , in the future , Google will still not be bound by any points of the constitution to disclose information on request secret FBI , of whatever kind . 
Meanwhile , the federal government successfully obtained some 50 , 000 Web addresses and 1 , 000 research terms it gained because of the stronger child protection law , passed several years before . , it failed to acquire the lists from investigations of individual users , or the entire list of Internet sites and keywords from the past two months .
The judgment of Google is quite inconsistent it is attacked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data , because they think their inner world and their private sphere suffer when they are starting to use the services of Google . Therefore , they argue against them in the spirit of revolt that protests manifest against multinational companies that take pride in their conservative image .
Meanwhile , American geek culture and its wild boys gathers the passionate , activists and enthusiastic computer users which emerge in many countries , consider Google as the next big businesses generation , the trendy corporation , opposed to his rival , Microsoft , classified as a world invader because of Windows , even if both companies are fighting for the same goal . 
This may be explained by the fact that Google , unlike Microsoft , ask users neither for an identification code , nor do they ask for money for its applications . The documentary code and the package of programmes , are continually updated , are more accessible , younger and cooller , faced against the official giant of software .
The reason may also be that the geeks see exactly what is the problematic relationship between the individual rights and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word in recent years, just got behind him.
Indeed , the Web 2 . 0 does not relate to something other than collaboration , the fact that we something leave traces behind ourselves , and that we make something communication channels available to us , and while the something of these changes one by one , the essence something the same it is exposed . 
Any young person , in general , can have a profile on several public pages , from Facebook to Xanga , and he can even link them to other services , such as at Twitter Last . fm , listing his musical preferences . then he can connect those to a friend following site , like FriendFeed Blip . fm . These young people can also have blogs , on which their most recent photo galleries kept on Flickr Picasa automatically appear .
While you may know of many examples , such as the girlfriend who understands on viewing photos in the morning , taken with a circle of common friends , with which her friend has spent the evening , or the society that has dismissed one of its employees , for the honest opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management , we can be sure of one thing private end needs privacy be completely reconsidered these days . 
He who lives a life online is whatever he shows about himself , and that is so we can define the principle behind the behavior of today's young people . 
Somebody who is hiding something , or at least , wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly , can do it starting with , for example , Scroogle , using Google's searching system , , at the same time , leaving no sign intentionally .
The number of people who deliberately , not register themselves on public pages in order to make it impossible to locate them , is not insignificant . Google online services , from the text treatment to the image treatment , information reading can be replaced by alternative versions , which are not linked to a huge range of servers witch does not collect our best profile , having been to date .
The public expects, without really hiding it, when Google will reveal his true nature.
The company , with its current value of 156 billion dollars , is worth more than IBM 140 billion dollars , Intel 124 billion dollars or Coca Cola 110 billion dollars . The advertising AdWords Adsense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies , while the benefits introduced at increasingly great are causing severe headaches , not only to Microsoft , but to many other creators of computer programs . 
However, those criticisms are, in addition to all this, the contradictions of worrying effects: for example, the top management Society has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the kindergarten and company after the company has found it too expensive restaurants multiple daily, taken at any time. All this pales next to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced to the Chinese government and under the terms of their agreement, the company sees all the results that offends the good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime.
According one of the society s internal rules , new services are not announced when can be used . What is certain , is that in the coming months and years , they will change the world on new points . While some believe that Google s project of digitizing and archiving of books and magazines takes so great dimensions that society will soon faced the Supreme Court of United States , others fears its Health system , because in this one , we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analyses results , our doctors and our problems .
The fact that Google is setting up a genetic can give a good raw material for the next generation of science fiction novel . Cory Doctorow's novel , writing with orwellian , orwelliens a future in which a man could be approached in a horrendous only through Google's data .

The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis worsening, the newspaper leaders of the European press reported a "second 11 September."
"The global financial disaster, it should the American President", accusing the Rome daily La Repubblica. "the president has not been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised rushed to help a depressing..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour , evoked by the billionaire Warren Buffett , it is more appropriate to talk of a second 11 September .
A of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington . 
According to the vision of the daily newspaper El Mundo , it is the failings vision political leadership there which led the world vision to the of collapse . 
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing every day ; and thereafter , the whole world will pay dearly .
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the vote in Congress, there is a real threat : that Washington does not suggest a political tool to curb the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the vacuum, just when the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer – underlines the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still offer a lifeline to their staggering financial titubants , and thanks to their own taxpayers' money , they can save them from bankruptcy . 
Of course , if more banks like dominoes , then neither money nor new improvisations will not be sufficient . 
In the long term , we need member of the European Union to mind less their national member interest , and centralize control over the financial member . 
Just Monday , the weakened financial institutions have received more than 100 billion recalled the Viennese daily , Der Standard , which adds that fears that European taxpayers also will have to pay , very much , similarly to Americans in order to remedy the crisis , are becoming more and more realistic . 
So far , the EU has not really dealt with the crisis , which , like a tsunami , crosses , from hand to side , the old continent . 
The "rescue workers' should not fly straight to 100 billion, by contrast it would be wise if they notaient how it would be rational to touch the taxpayers' money, with the aim to prevent more serious damage.

What method would be best to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if not imitation of a sensor obstacles that already exists in nature?
As for example, the one of bees.
For the draft presented at CEATEC , taking in Japan , buzzing draft bourdonnantes gave departure engineers the draft idea which inspired them inspiration to how they had draft the next generation of obstacles . 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo , Nissan has built a mini robot car , a bio inspired , order robotized system , BR23C , which it has equipped with the of bees , the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles . 
During its flights , each bee is its own space , ovally shaped , which in reality is very similar to our safe protection hulls , said at the exhibition , Kazuhhiro Doi , the director of the Department research and development and brand's technology public relations . 
The multifaceted facets of the bee plays an important role , as facets is able to see in all directions , in terms 300 degrees . 
To mimic the functions of the facets , engineers came up with the idea of télémètre laser facets . 
It identifies the obstacles in a way of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C it assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, who turns into avoidance maneuver.
The perception of the barrier is taking place in a split second. Then, the Mini car robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, changing the direction of its wheels in the end of a light enough to avoid the collision.
Unlike any system that currently exists , this of avoidance place entirely with an instinctive . 
If it was not , the mini robot car could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacle , explains Toshiyuki Andoh , the director of the Mobility Laboratory and of the robotic car project .
It must respond instinctive and instantly, as this technology is the most vulnerable and most of the envelope, a layer of protection for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process should reflect what the bee do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a instant . 
opposed to bees , the difference is not to be able to go upwards , downwards on the diagonal , it can only have two dimensions , and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn .
In this way , instead of the endless combinations that bees possess to avoid way bees , in our case , one way use only rotary rotatif , speeding up way slowdown down moves available provision a mini robot way . 
The BR23C uses lithium batteries which are lighter and combination energy is greater , what makes their living longer than the lithium ion version . 
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction which is essential, not the data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism must treat with just some incoming messages per second , and with them . 
It is not necessary to store store and react with the intuitive logic based on store from previous games . In this way , it store continuously only a few dozen kilo octets of store . 
We do not need gigabits memory capacity , or even . 
It is the first step towards the concept of a technology for the avoidance instantly. According to estimates of Nissan, this system will make its entry into the cars manufactured in the series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its inclusion in the GPS satellite navigation system, so it can guide the driver to his destination and avoid the obstacles on his way.

A name has even been given to the overpriced baby.
The written version of the economic recovery plan of $700 billion, to redeem the troubled loans from banks, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half that amount will be spent.
Reuters News that during debates even until after midnight local time Saturday in the East Coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the controversy that exists for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion.
We have taken a serious step forward , said Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of the US House of Representatives , according to whom it only remains to put the agreements on paper . 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the programme will work and will be effective , however other measures still need to be implemented . According to Pelosi , it is not here , of the the rescue of Wall Street , but to turn the workings of the economy in the another direction . 
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets , on Sunday night at 8pm local time in Washington i . e . , on Monday at 2am , according morning the local time in Central Europe , but has not caused a dramatic in the stock exchanges . 
On Monday , the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill behalf the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 . Then , its fate will be in the hands of the Senate . 
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House has also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with progress achieved last night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy", said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
Moreover, the programme is the original proposal made by the Bush administration, which she mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent only once, for the purchase of securities on the appropriations.
Now, maximum half the sum of $700 billion can be used. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This amount will be the Treasury secretary to buy bad loans from banks, while the use of $100 billion more will be left at the discretion of the president.
The programme will be overseen by an independent body , in which the president of the Federal Reserve body take part too . 
The spending of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree in Congress.
Under the law, the Secretariat of the Treasury will be able to implement a strategy combined: It can also buy bad loans and securities related to mortgages and dubious mortgages and other types of debt "toxic".
The people of the ministry said that bailouts can take place within the framework of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program , in which the Treasury Department guarantees the which are the for , for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable . 
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the required tools to spend $700 billion for the financial system urgent needs such as the huge buyback of dubious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system triggering the collapse of one or another financial institution.
"We shall take the necessary measures, to be prepared to law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
However, bankers are in bad position and waiting for aid from the État can expect their redundancy payments, called simply gilded parachute overseas, will be limited by the government.
The salaries is mentioned only in specific case . Moreover salaries restrictions depends on the the Treasury Secretariat proposes salaries aid to the company . 
The capping provisions state that the Treasury Department does the buyback in the form of an auction , it will levy an additional tax on the golden parachute , unless the president of the discredited bank retires .
Immediately after the purchase of the bad debts , the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to top leaders will not be excessive . 
For the image to be complete , we still need to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified . The cap only concerns new contracts , motivating the participation to the plan .
It is the first time in the history of États-unis that legal ceilings limits will be in force on the allowances of the directors - has commented on the commission president in charge of financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition , the state reserves the right to buy shares in banks taking part in the plan . This way , the risk that face taxpayers diminishes , because they can even gain from the deal as soon as the economy and by the saved banks get back on their feet .
The draft law says that within five years ahead, the president must submit to Congress a proposal that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who had expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not why the people commissionned us , this does not protect the people of taxpayers said the Republican member of California , people Issa . 
His Democrat colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that the people who are pushing the measures are the same that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The press cuttings of the German language 
camp right right is intact , it is only camp the heart right the party that voters have become camp aware this right how the Der Spiegel is refering to the camp score of right Bavarian Christian Social Union in camp country 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de.)
In the Internet of information German left wing magazine , Franz Walter information causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in information article entitled The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers information 
According to this acknowledged political scientist, the erosion of the CSU started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades now , these are the same modern citizens who are turning their backs on it .
This change of era is simultaneously the problem of all Christian democracy , and , the one of Angela Merker too .
For the CSU , the failure was not a complete surprise , but on Sunday , there came to an a process that was likely just ten years before the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended . 
Ten years before that , in 1998 , the CSU ramassait with 47 . 7 percent , and , for the first time since the 1950s , with score that level below 50 percent . 
It has said it was three years ago during the election of the Bundestag in 2005 when the much talked about Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernisation "devouring her parents', put in place in the region so consistently by the CSU.
It is 40 years, sociologists say that but they have been misled about the pace, secularization, the results of Education and the establishment of Germans of the north and is in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not stay without consequences on the loyalty of voters.
An update goes hand-in-hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right right camp is intact , it is only in the of the right that voters have become more aware , more critical and right stubborn . 
It is equally astonishing that , in recent weeks , it was precisely the academic citizens which were rather distant from the CSU , such as the self employed , the artisans , holders box those with post studies . 
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 percent.

Die press diepresse . com . 
In his article entitled who ? with who ? the party chairman remains reserve when faced with questions of the chairman the conservative Austrian newspaper is dealing with the chairman of confusing domestic policy which settled after the chairman elections . 
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to talk with the Conservatives in the ÖVP . 
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ to meddle in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open to negotiations. The greens do not want to agree yet over the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly showed their cards.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is indeed possible it is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist socialist . 
The question according to whether he would picture a coalition with Wilhelm Molter , the current president of the Övp , as vice chancellor , remains part from Faymann . 
As he mentioned , Schüssel Molterer direction was , in any case , rejected . 
A replay of this combination is out of question . 
Molterer reacted with caution to the proposals from the red . 
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be a failure if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is a very open. These items must be discussed within the Övp.
Jörg Haider, BZÖ president, is open again to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.

Járóka said We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation 
Today , began in Paris , the European Summit for Égalité opportunities , of which guest is the representative representing the current presidency of the European Union . 
In her message presentations the plenary house , as one of the message mouthpieces of the consultation of experts , Lívia Járóka message presentations Fidesz European house Party , drew attention message presentations in education house because this is a violation message presentations which house affects Roma children , and message therefore one presentations the main house to their success in life message 
On behalf of the French presidency , this high level conference was opened in by Xavier Bertrand , the French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs , and in by Vladimir Spidla , European Commissioner for Work , Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities . 
Among the invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners , as well as the most prominent legal protection representatives and European civilian agencies , in the area of equal opportunities . 
According to the bureau's press group of Fidesz party járóka warned that the distinctions in the recruitment, Roma disappear from the labour market, in first place, following their qualifications.
An overwhelming majority of young Romani have no high school qualifications , and as a consequence of a poor quality basic education , only a tiny part has the opportunity to obtain a high education degree . 
Moreover , Járóka has insisted that education as a fundamental right of human beings plays a key role when one has to assert the other fundamental rights .
Investing in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union countries . 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, equally between the Roma and the non-roms.
Indeed , the earlier a Romani child starts school , the more it increases his chances of becoming a productive member on labour market ; by the tax paid from his income and his consumption , he is involved in the budget . 
by their nationality in the European Union , the Roma must be nationality of their right to a quality education , and to be nationality from a poor quality , sectarian education nationality Lívia Járóka emphasized . 
According to the member , a European Union collaboration geared towards member goal and an action is needed for an immediate of member process of schools . For this , abiding by member anti discrimination directives in and in preparation is of member importance . 
We need to break the vicious cycle of poverty , segregation and . We must give Roma children the opportunities assured by democracy , so that they can participate part the future of right as citizens with full Járóka járóka . 
On behalf of Année Européenne pour des Égalité guaranteed for all , the summit's aim for equality Égalité Europe held every year since the summit in Berlin Égalité year , is to ensure a unique platform to Égalité the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and Égalité the fight against discrimination , targeted at European level Égalité within individual countries .

CSU Pardonned for a transition period . 
It is in October that will be taken the decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber Beckstein 
Despite this pathetic electoral failure , head not fallen off yet , and the debate head personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian Christian head Union has been postponed . 
The party's president, Erwin Hube and the regional government leader, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is: When will end the grace?
The fate of the tandem , having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 percent , will be on the agenda of the special party congress , held during the last weekend of October . 
Members of this heavily criticised pair case made felt that they didn't specifically wanted to hold their seats case 
Thanks to this , they endeavored to appease the angry members of the group of the base , which a day after the Bavarian tsunami , demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority .
Five years before admittedly still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber at the very top of his career the Christian Social Union garnered 60 . 7 percent , while today , a year after the coup against Stoiber , only 43 . 4 percent of their strength remains . 
During 46 years , the CSU has been the only of Bavaria giving 18 percent of the German GDP . 
But, conservatives have always strongly in the southern region, important key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal restructuring of the party, the vice president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as a possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this small group of recognition, who initiate discussions feeling our way ahead with the liberal FDP, and with the electeurs free, trained on the values of right, about a possible coalition government in Munich.
A mockery strange fate has been using the list of electeurs free, in the legislation Gabriele Pauli, including taking action against stroiber served as a possible coup by the duo huber-beckstein, then to address bluntly the very ambitious woman municipal politics.
Now , leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilise , one or another , Beckstein . 
In this transition , Stoiber , who until now pulled the strings behind the scenes will be given an active role . The former head of the regional government and ex chairman of the CSU , has called September 28th the bitterest day of his political career .
Monday, Huber launched ascerbic remarks against the CDU. According to him, they would have earned a lot more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be Chancellor again if they restore in one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, barely concealing her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU shall not negatively influence the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which is relative , , because it will not be easier to manage the damaged CSU , and the Social Democrats' crisis is still ongoing .
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.

rivals 110 0 . 
No member of the opposition came to parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian monitors , this is explained by a country led by monitors Lukashenko , who assures its prosperity and stability , monitors according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE monitors this is explained by committed during the monitors of the votes . 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not approve the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million works well in opposition for many decades before the election yesterday, the opposition joining forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (odsz) had hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, in the footsteps of changing the constitution in 2006, 'would' this time the presence of some members of the opposition in parliament.
This odsz renounced his boycotting originally planned.
The fact that Belarus , increasingly economically dependent on Russia , wanted improve its relations with the EU , where because the political order of Belarus is classified as undemocratic , Lukashenko and several senior politicians do not receive entry visa , was one of the expectations of the opposition . Belarus had to take a loan because of the reduction of Russian natural gas imports , always more expensive , and contributed to the Beltransgaz enterprise , owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country , passing into Russian hands .
The fact that the OSCE in the evaluation of the campaign, stressed the positive changes rather than on areas such as the ban to run for a third of candidates for the opposition, was referring to an easing in advance.
However , release OSCE on Monday challenged the campaign , during release most of the opposition candidates could not release in the media , and particularly the fact that release opposition could not be present for counting votes . 
Despite all this, the opposition feels quite an improvement palpable in the political regime: the political detainees have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontation with Moscow, still in refusing to recognise South Ossetia and abazzia split from Georgia, Russia and Belarus form a federation on paper, consider the two territories as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and a step backwards, but most important is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that it remains, despite that "the power has been afraid to parliament which has no weight, to make even a single opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protests in light of the results . It is rather trying protests get its message across on the need for economic reforms protests the voters . 
"We obviously have a lot of concern in this area: we need to print newspapers opponents in Russia, local authorities we put up obstacles for the spread, but I can see that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of elderly people," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, who considers the social security as its main outcome, the ozone pensioners most supported officially regard him as much as appropriate.
of the country's indebtedness and the rise of the trade deficit , the collapse of Social Security , 'evoking the silence of a graveyard' , is just a matter of time think Milinkevich .
Unlike the opposition politician , the Russian monitors certified the elections as democratic . 
Sergei Lebedev , leader of the Commonwealth of Independent States , told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti People do not believe in words , but in deeds . , the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of the Belarussian voters .

Brunetta said: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never in the history of the Chigi Palace have we had revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today , is in effect this new measure against the smart asses , against who they clock out and then go to drink coffee at the pub during working hours . 
The new anti idlers was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration , Renato Brunetta , and by the Secretary General of the Council Presidency , Mauro Masi . 
The revolving doors tournantes Brunetta are a tool to work better , with more tournantes , more attendance and more services says the minister tournantes 
Now is starting a new season of accountability and transparency . 
It is reformist also stresses Brunetta . 
The installation of the council presidency in every is completing with the Chigi palace . 
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important, even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees has been recorded , the secretary general assured It is a shared by employees , and we have had the cooperation of all . 
In short , no more breakfast during working hours no more coffee nor croissant .
Promise of Brunetta, suggesting with a smile, "a good 7 o'clock cappuccino in the morning is a good and healthy resolution".
During a Public Administration High School conference . 
Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months, the absence of disease of public employees are reduced by 50%, 60milles workers in a year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the public administration more efficient.
The Italian, "whose dynamic salariales- explains the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled in the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation.
Meanwhile , thousands employees civil , united to challenge the standards of employees Brunetta decree by making use of Codacons . 
While the minister of Public Office spreads today data regarding the decrease in absenteeism in the workplace because of illness writes the consumers association the active lazy people continue to rise .
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the public administration, gathered to declare war on illegitimate standards, contained in the decree.
In particular , in Tar , we question the prohibition of extra allowances in case of service disability ; the extension of ill worker s house working hours , during which there are inspections , and other aspects of the new rules proposed by the minister .

Accidents in the workplace, Napolitano: "prevention is crucial."
Every day , in Italy , one day , there are 2 , 500 accidents , 3 and 27 people who are disabled permanently . 
INAIL's data confirms , in fact , that in 2007 there were about 1 , 200 white deaths .
The figures indicate the gravity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To focus the attention of institutions , social forces and resources of information on this dramatic , ANMIL celebrates today , in all Italian provinces , the 58th national day for victims of accidents at work , established as the second Sunday in October . 
The disturbing information provided by ANMIL , as well as the tragic events of recent days , confirm the importance of prevention in the workplace , says Italian President Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to Pietro Mercandelli , President of ANMIL , the national association of those who have been injured and disabled in the workplace . 
The head of state expressed his sincere appreciation for the collaborative ongoing effort associations favour to prevention in the workplace , protection of injured workers , assistance to families of victims and of public awareness . 
Naturally indignant , everyone hit the table to put an end to such tragedies which , by their size , raise the rest of media and the participation of opinion , even if the daily reality presents the dramatic case even repetitive in their dynamic . 
Napolitano does not deny that there is certainly a matter as to resources it is essential to invest in training matter information . 
The many initiatives promoted in the schools bear a special significance for greater awareness of the young people entering world work . 
It is our duty to keep attention focused on this phenomenon , not to underestimate the alarm about its societal seriousness , implement and improve the legislative standards . 
The president of the house Gianfranco Fini has pointed out that "this phenomenon of dead white is a social emergency, who insult the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a real effort to end quickly".
The data of people injured at work appear to indicate a slight positive trend , but that does not prevent that the number of white deaths is still impressive has the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli underlined .
We do not want that this 'trend toward on the cheap' actually translates into diminished attention because it is precisely when attention relaxes that tragedy occurs . 
"We believe that in general, we are not doing enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and this contrast can be done through multiple actions."
We believe Mercandelli emphasized more mercandelli and inspections are necessary , like greater intervention into mercandelli training of workers , from school onward mercandelli 
He ajouté that yet another effort must be done concerning communication ajouté raising public awareness . 
"But the more important, a greater sense of responsibility from employers facing a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"mercandelli subsequently denounced" the progressive deterioration of the conditions to safeguard the compensation for victims of the work "and" the drift of assistance to the system is moving in recent years ".
The objective thus , is for giving the worker the guarantee of insurance he added so that the fate of anyone who has an accident , should not depend on the spontaneity or the widening of the legislature .

"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently make use of portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, unconsciously can damage their hearing an irreparable," says Meglena Kuneva.
According to scientific scientifiques the responsible Ue continues it is a clear risk and we scientifiques react quickly . 
What matters most is to raise the awareness of consumers and to make public this domain . 
We need to check again the existing control systems , given the scientific opinion , in order to make them entirely effective that can follow new technologies .
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem , given the intensive use of portable music devices and the in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate . 
"The scientifiques-conclue executive ue- confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now look at with the member states and other interested parties, what could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and appliances.
There is already a European for security , which limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100db , but the concern is growing about the harm that could come from excessive exposure to such noise sources . 
It is possible to adequately limit these data making use of solutions like of levels and of the length of exposure to noise . 
The EU Scientific Committee pointed out that users of portable music devices who listen to music at full volume over 89 decibels for five hours per week are exceeding the limits currently in force as to the acceptable level of noise in the workplace . 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods , are at of permanent hearing loss after 5 years .

Obama? The first anti-American president. This is why.
A famous American politician who wants to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter , who , part his decisions , destroyed the US economy and had a reports as he still has today , as a private part with the enemy Islam . 
The attacks against Obama as the date of the elections are getting closer . 
A lady from Miami has written on a website This person lady full of ambition . 
culotté is really full of himself he believes he will win the highest office in culotté nation which has altogether two black governors and culotté black senators ! 
In actual fact , these are attacks which mean very little ; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature , and do not answer the question of all the voters Will he be a good president ? We have , in addition , the polls , which all say that Obama will win and by a good margin . 
In this case, it is again someone who speaks from the heart and not from the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper , in the South United States , wrote an article once in the , we well know who the American Patriot will give his vote to . 
Here is one aspect of the American mindset kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we shall we put the cross, Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: If Obama wins, we will leave from the United States.
Things never revealed till now , so much so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain . 
Anyway , despite all these arguments , the winning winner for the Democrats is George Bush . 
It was asked to 1500 people What were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure ? 89 cent replied Iraq . 
America is changing.
In Vietnam , this nation has lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back home with a in fesses . 
In Iraq , 4500 soldiers have lost their lives , and Americans have not been forced to pack their suitcases . 
Despite this, Iraq was, for most, the weakness of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will have an enormous to accomplish .

USA , the economic debacle is felt even among journalists in the press is the for deletions and many blame the Internet , this killing of the paper newspaper . 
The Pew Research Center questioned five American hundred journalists about the status of their profession and about control in the future . 
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However , they have not openly declared to the value , information be feeling less worried about the credibility value 
They do not feel isolated as in the . 
The problem of American journalists, it is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition , the losses incurred in the newsroom , in the room where the editors work at assembling the newspapers , are a big problem . 
This is a problem that must be resolved , according to the journalists interviewed , if one hopes that traditional media such as the public understands it , will not be reduced substantially .
A clear but complex pessimism invades the American journalism.
Six in ten senior executives and journalists from printed printing are convinced that journalism at national level is heading printing wrong way . 
Locally , the executive executive is at 65 . 
Printed publication against broadcast . 
Journalists have no in seeing where the web in going . 
The larger homes are éditrices themselves a shift towards internet , seen by many éditrices the 'murderer' paper newspaper . 
The economic pressure that smell journalists were feeling , increased up to 79 . 
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted taking to technology hoping it "will do something good" for their journalism.
agreements , the largest in the American journalism is between those agreements run the newsrooms i . e . the directeurs agreements reporters who work for them . 
56 of managers at national level , are convinced that the reporters share their values , while at local level , this percentage goes down to 23 .
For some , this is linked to work work . 
The directors who plan to lose their area within 3 years , are of 47 of the national . 
Concerning journalists, we are heading towards 30%.
The one of safe working concerning the level our authors , ed in America is still level the agenda authors 
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In such a vast nation as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it is fast becoming an issue of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always earn big wages , while the editor can earn ten thousand dollars per month , besides pension and the payment of insurances .
Concerning holiday , the logic becomes complicated days after the first year , days after the third , up to 15 days in all , after a certain number of years . 
But , according to their revelations , American journalists are often sick during the revelations . 
It is the fault of the climate.

Elites in danger.
The phenomenon has already shown a few days, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans, and still is, more interested to punish Wall Street to save the American economy.
And yesterday s New York Times confirms it well announcing that the current crisis divides the Republican party , even more divided between his East Coast old soul , moderated , pro federal institutions and pro business community , and its new soul , on instead contrary , conservative , hostile to those of Washington and to the world of finance , powerful especially in central and southern states . 
The Soul, which has made to feel a despotic rule with the vote which I mentioned earlier.
However what has been mentioned is only one example of the changes , the big changes that the ongoing economic earthquake pre announce or let already not only in the United States , but everywhere in the West , and may be not just there . 
The United States in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena couvés for some time, so that, in the new climate, they solidifient and show.
The first of these phenomena is the updating , the extraordinary stimulus , of the sovereign state etat category compared to a sort renationalisation of the economy . 
The crisis , indeed , is a crisis of banking financial institutions that have , obviously close relationships abroad , but who , above all , are involved on a large scale with the balance sheets of people and families who live in one country , in one state . 
This immediately creates a political problem for those rules govern it i . e . , how to rules to the difficulties and the protests of individuals and rules electorate are not . 
In short, the crisis appears economically worldwide, but politically, it is here nearly national.
The political really seems to be game or , have little to say about that the obvious evidence is game by the European Union , which as usual game shared between the various interests and the various national game , not succeed to decide any common policy . 
And , it is from the government of each state that all are waiting for speeches , rescue and recovery plans , new rules , and especially a credits affection when one s going through a difficult period , only the States have the economic resources , the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in place .
They also possess the necessary resources and the legitimacy to use them two priceless resources , things which no market or international organisation can ever use in a similar way . 
This new emphasis of the nation is in perfect harmony with the importance still major economic developments most recent economics tend to give a factor quite linked to this point: the territorial limits.
And, paradoxically, when we were convinced to now be entered in the Kingdom of the network, technology increasingly sophisticated, no equipment, convinced that global finance was now aimed to dominate the world we have found a bat, that our future will have to settle scores more with the things relatively little material such as water, harvest, the oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another one on Earth, but which are definitively linked to a restricted area, a territory.
Thus, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards than that which is not, i.e., anyone who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and water.
I now come to the experiment , however , which predicts a fracture . 
He who says Territory , State , Government , inevitably says Politics , and thus Leadership . 
, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomenae .
One side, the conscience of the need objective of authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who will take control of the situation.
On the other hand , a disrepute wave for the existing leaderships , economic species that have been proved inadequate and full of dark areas .
And furthermore , something even more profound , and in some sense , even worrying a shadow , a suffering , an image of inadequacy , a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries in the West . 
increases even more the conviction of the various classes , before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now to their apogee , their way of listening and of being , their culture in the complex acceptance of the term , to have same time , and to be increasingly more foreign with the opinions of the majorities .
In short, demand for leadership, fueling below, a powerful and ramifié movement of délégitimassions ruling classes and traditional political orders in the 'revolt' electoral improvised or, in the changes of collective moods of recent very recently, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Britain, the rebellion of delegates Americans against Bush (and that the victory of the right in Italy is not by chance).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, would anyone have more difficulty, which is not starting today, to understand and therefore to represent the deeper layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and wave potentially too much.
Seeing sight this , to talk of a current rebellion of the sight on the agenda talk seems frankly exaggerated . 
But one says well, to keep one's eyes wide open, it is not without reason.

The super supercolle to walk on the walls . 
Defeating the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue, and in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the aim of various American research centres , and today , a aim of four institutes centres succeeded at it . 
With an adhesive barely 2 . 5 centimeters , researchers have succeeded in keeping stuck corps 100 kilograms on a vertical . 
etude the American Science has published the findings etude some researchers from the University of Dayton , of Akron , etude Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research etude . 
The material , invented by the team of researchers , is an of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon , called nano tubes of carbon . 
The principle of the glue can be imagined a series of tubes diperses a pile of spaghetti . says Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos , which are overlaid by microscopic hair which ensure the animal , a perfect adhérente . 
The testing of various materials, such as glass, the téflon, and the paper, glass, have demonstrated that the new removed is ten times more powerful than the legs of the reptiles, and together, that he "stands out easily from the walls," explains Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty of engineering from University of Dayton.
Walk on the walls? – 'this material could be used as temporary scotch-tape" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls as Spiderman ? Maybe that yes , but researchers think of a much less fascinating such as the connection between electronic appliances , given that the carbon are of heat and electric current . 
Other applications could aerospace engineering . 
For now, no super heroes.
Other Research The University of Berkeley , in California , is doing it , in the search for a new adhesive .
In an article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society , California researchers introduced an adhesive made up of , like , which clean dust off themselves during their movement over a to guarantee a perfect and constant grip .

The Nobel in economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for Economy has been given to American Paul Krugman for his research on models of trade and the location of economic activity . 
Krugman , 55 , is a neo Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous columnist of The New York Times . 
Krugman is one of the greatest criticism of the solutions in economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times, the second event would have been more crucial that the first, in effect in US history.
A prediction which unleashed many controversies, and which was blamed upon the economist for years, but which now has proved accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked of the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or WorldCom, have disappeared from public attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi , of the executive committee of the European Central Bank , Krugman is an economist of great value , but also a divulgateur with a very aggressive style , particularly critical towards the excesses liberalism of the Bush administration .

Immigrants New York Times wonders if Italy is racist ? 
Italy "as an immigrants country recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with resistance.
This transformerait-il beautiful countries in a nation of racist? it is intéroge the New York Times who has dedicated a long article discussing the subject of racism in Italy, based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a boite of biscuits.
This case highlights that the New York Times describes as "the paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where there is "more and more work," but also "a sense anti-immigrés the strongest and most important support to Northern League."
Confirming the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants , the NYT also made to episodes of intolerance in Milan , Parma , Rome , Ciampino and Castel Volturno . 
Not only.
Even the new legislature sought by Lega to curb immigration and legislature the return of illegal immigrants , is cited as legislature of climate change in Italy .

Students victims of high rents , up to 900 Euro for a . 
The renting market for students does not know any crisis
According to the latest survey of Sunia , the tenants' union , to rent a simple house simple cost a student up to 900 Euros euro Milan , 700 in Florenc , 650 in Naples , 600 in Rome . 
"The phenomenon has now reached very seriously at the point to exclude entire groups of young, the right to the study because of the overall costs so high that families in need soutenir- explains the responsible for the Bureau of studies of Sunia, Laura mariani- in those cities, the strong demand from the students has distorted the market that a process of widespread increase is amorcémême for residents.
In most cases , the rental tender in addition include a series of violations contracts type tender , unregistered , limit rent , tender rentals . 
For the Sunia, exceptional measures through the taxation review, are needed to calm prices.
I read in detail the investigation, we see in Milan, for a bed in the area Brianza, it should be around 450 euros; for a simple, we will at least 650 euros (area gang Nere), an average value of 800 (lambiate zone, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (area Vittoria.)
In Florence , a bed costs , on average , 350 400 euros , a house around 700 euros . 
In Bologna , where students are concentrated in the areas close to the university , it costs 250 280 euros for a bed in a double , and 370 to 500 for a simple . 
In Rome , in the areas near the central San Lorenzo , Piazza Bologna , they charge about 600 Euros for a single , 450 for a bed in a double . 
Slightly lower values 550 euro for a simple for the areas close to the euro universities Ostiense and Cinecittà . 
You can only save you distance yourself in the outlying areas 300 euro for a bed , and 450 for a simple in the Predestina , Centocelle or similar areas .
In Naples , you need 300 400 euros for a bed . For a single , we spend 400 to 600 euros , with higher prices in the areas of Policlinico , Vomero , and Colli Aminei . 
In Bari , for a , it takes 250 350 euros , at least 350 for a . 
In smaller towns, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a great importance in the cities economy.
, cities such as Perugia , in which rentals are often taken by students from outside the community , there is an anomaly the rent later for foreign students is increased by 25 30 compared to that applied to Italians .

Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities éliment historical rooms.
The historic cinemas are closing in favour of multiplex . 
"A city without cinemas is a blind city , it is like a face without eyes."
The image provided by the director Giuseppe Tornatore , well shows what happens image major Italian , but also in image cities . 
The process of marginalisation of theatres, with the birth on the outskirts of big multisalles, and the death of consomption of Mono rooms in central areas of cities, is one of major events, which is inevitable and intuitive; he has all the characteristics of a real crime, cultural.
To disappear , it is often historic full of memory places , it is like one of my friend disappeared , someone we known , with whom we shared a bit of the road so many emotions observes the director of the Nuovo Cinema Paradiso , the film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago , the first Oscar the Grand Prize at Cannes juror , witch was telling the poetry of a provincial auditorium , nostalgia for a way to experience cinema , maybe forever lost .
The figures provided by ANEC , the main Association of Traders , shows everything the last five years , 316 traditional movie theaters shut down , these are the main cities' movie houses which have paid the bill 10 less in Florence , 9 in Milan Rome , Naples , Bologna , 6 , at least in less in Turin , 5 in Palermo .
Among the areas most affected by the closure , the Roman Emily is at the top with 82 single rooms cinemas lost , followed by the Tuscany 44 and the Lombardy 41 . 
The proof confirming t that primarily responsible for their demise is the advent of multiplex because of the three Italian regions that have the most new cinemas multisalles: 195 screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as emilie-romagne.
"The Italian exploitation has grown so irrational," observed Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would need to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a firm in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all prepared to go to multiplex.
Without mentioning the missed deliberation of the credit for traders the antecedent debt of the State is around 10 million euros traders 
It is shameful that , from an ethical and moral étique of view , the government does not abide by the étique laws . 
To support the industry will require between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna , the first Italian city that , concerned about these closures , decided to resolve the situation with the signing of a protocol between City Hall and ANEC , the first of its kind in Italy , to protect and promote cinemas room rooms in historic centre and on the outskirts . 
Among the expected , there are state tax measures in favour of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone and will have special tariffs for parking spaces and in certain parking parks . 
It is an initiative that I am very fond of note Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by establishing place measures . 
However , it is clear that , in order to contrast the superpower of the multiplex rooms , the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image , because the public of today is more demanding . 
Traditional film defence issue a which has always been film for me the closure issue the Bagheria's Supercinema , place film my childhood issue teenage adolescence was the spark that film me to issue 'New Movie House Paradiso' which I thought film 10 10ans . 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I turn to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have both experienced emotions shared, I turn on the other side not to see signs noircis by dust.

The arrests of this morning follow those of last July , following which the police announced having decapitated the décapitée clan . 
At the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; back in 1991, and always because of alleged conditions between organised crime and the local administration, local politicians had been discharged of their duties to administer the city.

Here is an enormous source which occupies over 70 of the size of the planet and now big global companies are discovering it . 
Waves , currents , tides , here are the new renewable sources on which behemoths such as Chevron have set , and are now trying to lay . 
The possibility of energy from the movement of the sea is considered for now a hundred years, and in the 1970s alongside the first oil crisis, the research have intensified.
When oil prices lowered, around 1980, the idea of exploiting the marine energy was sidelined, but now the environmentalists and the new increase of oil prices give a big rise to the sector
The World Energy Council WEC of London valued in 2007 , that 15 of worldwide electricity need could be covered by systems exploiting seas . 
That amount would be twice size amount produced by nuclear power stations . 
And , there would be the currents and the tides . .
Colossi to attack . 
The first company to bet on marine navy has been the Enersis , who in 2005 , navy siglé an agreement to build a plant in northern navy . 
When the agreement was announced , it didn't really seem revolutionary revolutionary 
Two years later, still more candidates among these companies which have always been dedicated to traditional energy are banking on marine energy.
Chevron is currently studying the technologies on oceanic energy said the spokesman of a company associated with the American oil giant , to the economic daily Wall Street Journal it evaluates opportunities to cooperate with us .
Cooperation in question, is a deliberate enabled by the US Commission on the energy needed to give rise to a marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting , especially if you consider that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and President Bush recently set up a project for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. In New York and ocean power of New Jersey, who travel the route of energy from the sea, and the amount invested until today, although their details are known, according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology . 
The experts are stating about a technology still in its infancy , from the fact that marine energy did not dispel fears concerning environmental impact . 
At the being , systems like those in Portugal , or some in Scotland , are small , and do not seem to create big problem to the ecosystem . 
To produce energy on a large scale , however , one must use technology with a higher environmental impact . 
And the choices are diverse Ocean Power , for example , uses a system of buoys connected to each other .
The pressure of the waves , which moves sludge up and water , is converted sludge hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylindres inside the cork . 
The pressure causes the turbine to spin which in its , feeds a generator . 
The energy is sent to the side through underwater sailors . 
For now, we have four systems such as project, in anticipation of a single federal approval and part of energy could be used to a military installation.
Verdant Power, instead, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six turbines in the Marines of the East River in New York.
The movement of the water at the tides turns the turbines' , creating a rotary which feeds a generator . 
Verdant said that it had a long list of customers waiting needed permission to draw some energy . 
After the waves, tides.
A special interest , they say at the electric Institute of electricity , is worth at the time , the potential of tides . 
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon , tide is more predictable than wind , sun , or waves , and therefore more reliable as an energy source . 
And it is precisely on tides energy that like New York , Maine and Alaska , with others , look toward the coasts , have invested 7 and a million dollars in 2008 and will invest up to 35 million in 2009 .

The bennes sorting are not in the perfume in Brno 
In À everyone can sort out his own drinks , À in the villages of Southern Moravia you drinks across bennes on every street corner . 
And in Brno?
Here , you would need to take several minutes before finding the bennes . 
I do not mean that we do not sort out Brno' waste.
But I have the impression that councillors in our city , the second impression city , councillors not interested enough in this problem impression 
Brno in the stone age of the sorting of waste not only because people cannot even select the paper, glass and PVC, but especially because many of bennes devoted to these waste.
Have you ever tried to drop a plastic bottle in the downtown ?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found for the moment , is the place of Moravia , in front moment Potrefena Husa . 
Mr Onderka and his colleagues do not want, but it seems sacrément little.
Without mentioning the fact that in other parts of the city it is not easy either.
And finally , many of my friends don't sort out their waste 
Out of laziness.
Ça is a good for them to reach the bennes . 
That does not surprise me from them.
After a festival, I have offered to go throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I saw no benne colour truck on Kounicova Street . 
Fortunately I found the proper place going to take the tram .
That said, waste were overflowing.
It is all the centre of Brno , which is supposed to represent the city at best , isn't it ? !
It is probably because ecology and esthétisme called don't really the Socialists in Brno too much esthétisme 
That they prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league is a disgrace to the city throughout the country , instead of buying a few extra bennes and providing more of the sort of raw materials for a cleaner Brno . 
I am glad to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after having taken a moment to check the internet.
According to data from the EKO-KOM Company, Brno really is the worst in the whole region of south Moravia.

The budget of Paroubek has removed from the argentaux and the holidays disease . 
After the left has increased, despite the government, farmers and officials there may lack money for pensions, the disease or savings housing.
But also for the interest on debt of the État or internationnal judicial proceedings . 
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says the finance minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some classes , they based it on the fact that the government will make loans for sensible spending , pensions or medical . Ça only puts the problems off until later , planting in the ground , said Janota . 
It is on borrowed money to pay the interests of more expensive and will need to be back sooner or later.
The État does not really have the choice to know where to État money . 
If he does not reduce aid or spending , he will have to raise taxes . 
À all those that the left wing has presently risen À , teachers , farmers left 
And thereafter, to their children.
People will get them and should not fear for their pensions or their health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater indebtedness of the État - next year it will therefore not 163 billion into the coffers, but more.
Despite the efforts of minister Janota the debt is going to grow faster and faster and with it , the expenses related to the interests .
The État will need money for the repayer and it does more to increase slightly VAT or reduce the maternity leave as the government in its anti-déficit package.
Five billion will also be missing to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
It is mainly sections and started already decided that it is not possible to change the projects to reduce possibly costs.
At most to keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stop 30 major sites, and the removal of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka's warning, ministry of transport spokesman.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very deftly it will draw from the dividend of ČEZ producer and distributor of electrical energy , of which État State is the bulk to feed the transport fund . 
The concern is that the of dividend is never certain and that it is in no dividend a well without a . 
Last year , 18 billion was navigués from the ČEZ into the budget . 
Each year , dividends are used to pay for removal up damage to supplement pension accounts and even pensions as a for the coming pension reform . 
Moreover , this device increases the real budget deficit to a of 5 . 7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules . 
And it is far from being the end of this carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensation to victims of Communism and of crimes , or even the compensation housing , decreased by nearly three billion . 
It is not certain that the État can act without this money . 
This is a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure , we will have to way him pay , Janota . 
The minister will then have to side on the department or , in the worst case side touch the government's budget . 
It is also short one hundred million to fund cash État of two billion , which should allow online of État of each administration . 
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warns.

Your next smartphone will master two operating systems.
Americans are envisaging a mobile phone in the future that À allow the user to move from one operating system À another by pressing a single button . 
The projects that were revealed seem promising.
One button is enough and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds . 
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of American society VMware , which deals primarily with the development of virtualisation for computers . 
We are going to allow you to manage two users at the same time on your mobile phone . 
You can alternate between them , you can see the personal and professional 
The two will work together, said Srinivas Krishnamurti society VMware in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was unveiled in November last year and it was first made a demonstration of it a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
virtualisation on smartphones is absolutely no fiction . 
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which ran simultaneously the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
The company VMware now works with the European and American operators to test virtualisation on smartphones , and customers should have access to the during 2012 .

The lack of snow in the mountains hotel 
The courses trails pose a problem not only for the operators of courses 
The lack of snow deters people from booking stays skiing in hotels and pensions . 
Thus, it is always possible to get rid of Chambers free for all the dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have plenty of hits on our site.
Internet users browse the offers , ask for prices , but do not dare to commit and reserve for the moment . 
And if they call us, they ask immediately whether there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend New year of his dreams to Špindlerův mlýn, better not too hesitant to reserve.
If we give priority to Economies and the quality of accommodation only come next, then we can try to wait a few days.
The hotel propose for the moment only hotel week week for the New Year . 
I think they will try again for a moment to place place , but they will give up too and will accept shorter period . 
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease , said Jandura . 
The tourism Ingtours of Vrchlabí also still proposes vacant beds for tourism periods of winter . 
The week of Christmas us the most for the moment , it is not completely sold . 
There are still unoccupied , let's say , about half the houses our offer . 
This is why we have already prepared a of stays minute Christmas , said Petr Schiefert , Ingtours director . 
The agency of tourism can also offer New Year in the Krkonoše , tourism there are fewer available places . 
The 14 first days of February are selling just as well , the remaining hivernaux sell moderately . 
This year , interest in winter visits has been negatively influenced by the fact that there visits still no snow in Krkonoše . 
The people are waiting for it to start to fall.
Nobody wants to spend winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks recover themselves during the week , Christmas also will be complete , thinks Schiefert . 
, occupancy of the hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year .
It was an improvement of almost five per cent.
We have some places left for New Year as well as for Christmas . 
During the January there is a great holiday interest from Poles , and February sells well holiday , advised Karel Rada , director of the best holiday in Pec . 
The Omnia hotel near the central of Jánské Lázně is also 80 per cent full during the New Year period . 
half of the beds remains empty during Christmas Instead the jánské lázně newest hotel .
This year , we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January , where we have already 60 per cent of occupation at the present moment . 
February is a little more low for now, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will still certainly rise said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not however hope for more snow . 
On Thursday it will be fresher there will be rain ; it should be snowy in the mountains .
But , the weather should warm up , Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informs us .

United States repetition is the mother of wisdom . 
It is even comical, painstaking effort with President Barack Obama to the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on Afghanistan, that he regarded himself as so simple.
When he eventually let his ardently awaited doctrine supporter , it proved to be a paper doctrine supporter the Bush scenario for Iraq from three years ago doctrine 
Not content with using the as in Iraq several times in the same text , he has in addition not hesitated to use the title of the Bush speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech A New Way Forward . 
Meanwhile, he has personally criticised Bush's idea to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a decision with disastrous consequences."
The following months have shown that Bush's strategy, which was issued recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success so the headlines today do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush , however , objectively speaking , he left his successor a far more favourable final situation than anyone could have hoped . 
Barack hope hopes that in Afghanistan , the miracle will happen again 
It is once again the commanders of campaigns, who asked him to an increase in military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley mccristal, which was severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40 , 000 to make the situation more favorable . 
The president hesitated for three months , he lacked for a better option , he had at least cheated the general out of 10 , 000 soldiers .
He has managed to obtain the promise of additional 5 , 000 from Europe , even if he was expecting 10 , 000 initially .
Which makes the most problems throughout the Obama strategy seems to be its intention to withdraw troops to Afghanistan by 18 months and to finish this process in three years ago. The doctrine of Obama leads to more questions than it does not provide answers.
Many have doubts about the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit the progress in Iraq . 
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years , the Iraqi society is relatively well organised its leaders honour the agreements .
The Afghan situation stands out for the exact opposite - one cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change of leader day to day according to what suits them.
Political institutions , although officially founded , will remain pan than dressing behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will continue to proliferate . 
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.
Even the foundation of a quick to act state , which is the aim of the operation , does not seem to be very real . 
The time of Obama's strategy is perplexing given his determination . 
In the past eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has only got worse and it is currently on the brink of chaos . 
Only a purely romantic heart and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent to the tumult of the war in order to their speedy return will bring a miracle . 
Politically, setting a date for withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible since the Taliban see it as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit demonstrated that the Europeans' to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is decreasing . 
European politicians neither know nor want to explain their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush . 
Another factor which is capable of radically altering the situation is the development of the events linked to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not have any effects on the Iranians , the Americans will find themselves facing the very difficult question resolution resolving the problem by the use of military force . 
It must be answered for example when , according to Obama , America will victoriously withdraw troops from Afghanistan .
Each solution of this kind will, however, drive a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only for Obama is the fact that three years are remaining until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to develop a new strategy in case this one would be revealed to be a flop .

The leaders of Goldman Sachs bank will not receive bonuses in cash anymore.
The senior leaders of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive leaders in cash this year . 
The company announced it in response to strong criticism of its pay practices . 
The group of 30 leaders will receive shares instead of money , which they leaders not be able to sell for five years . 
The measures could be withdrawn from the leaders in case they measures take too much risks . 
According to Reuters , Goldman Sachs is placing itself as the leader of the effort aiming to link remuneration with the long term performances on Wall Street .
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that we must take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the JPMorgan company.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank became the target of criticism after set aside  for itself almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters of this year.
For this year, the total amount of bonuses will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis , big premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries . 
Britain announced Wednesday that it intends to spend a single fee of 50 per cent bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.

The minister Janota considers resigning. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning Finance Minister Eduard Janota , who balances his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the State budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies 
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the position of Janota in the cabinet too will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the public finance crisis.
It was the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his office on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget will be subject to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion kronor to the Czech Republic should manage.
However , the Chamber of parliament has approved wednesday the proposals from the left on parliament transfers of money and increased the amount of officials parliament the operation of social services and direct payments to parliament . 
The government blamed the proposals of Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement is born between left and the government, Klaus and the right to disagree that calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer was formed by agreement between the ODS, the Čssd and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget , as it was voted by deputies , removes the package of saving measures passed by the Fischer government which should , according to him , stem the debt of the State .
Klaus , who can ratify the law on the State budget who is not obliged to do so , said today at a discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the serious problem of the unrestrained deficiency of public finances .
À now there is , according to him , no favourable À . 
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if it could rely on a consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS president Mirek Topolánek indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its ulterior existence.
Petr Nečas , Vice President of the ODS , told the ČTK that the idea of a official supported by the ČSSD , the ODS and the Greens just doesn't fly any more . 
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by former government of Topolánek is staggering and it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday , the ČSSD called the ratification of next year's État budget a success . 
The People's Party was also satisfied.

Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism that the principal roles are played by American actors , the South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus Unbeaten will expose to the world many things about the country , its fighting and its success . 
The story is about sport , relations between races and Nelson Mandela . 
American actor Morgan Freeman , rewarded by an Oscar , embodies the film on Nelson Mandela's , a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system in South Africa and first black president . 
Freeman said that it is a ninety one years old Mandela who asked him to embodies flesh in the film . 
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: 'If I have to embody you, I should be able to personally see you..
The 72 years old actor who has been rewarded by a price for his role in Clint Eastwood's drama Milion Dollar Baby located in the middle has , for example , embodied the leader of a movement against slavery who became himself a , a fictitious US president , even God shadow , in the film Almighty , but never someone as alive and important for so many people as Mandela . 
The former South African was jailed 27 years for his hard work to end the apartheid in South Africa . 
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875 . 
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country . The newly elected President Mandela knows that his resteencore still remains divided racialement and economically after apartheid . 
He is convinced to be able to unite his people by sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders at world . 
The South African team will finally move forward in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring the history of Nelson Mandela to the big screen . 
I had no other purpose than to play this role to bring it closer to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to speak like him
The actor said that if he and rights international politics been in the same region , rights would have tried to meet Mandela , dinner with rights , and to be in the scenes before his speech rights 
The most important for him was to shake hands with him.
I realized that when I shake hand with you, I collect some of your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film as François Pienaar, captain of a national rugby team  in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he has six months to prepare for a role in the harsh of rugby . 
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I arrived at the door of the home , he opened it for me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was 'I look much taller in the film . 
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the leadership of the filmmaker Eastwood received positive opinions and one's even talk about ambitions for the Oscars.

The mystery of the will in Norway is resolved the Russians were testing a rocket . 
One was able to observe a strange ring of unknown origin above Norway . 
The Russian Ministry of Defence has admitted only yesterday that he has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders . 
The launch , however , has been a failure again the Bulava missile which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
His repeated presence during the tests of the rocket has not had the expected effect on the success of the flights . 
Most of the time, either Bulava did not take off, or it was damaged in flight.
Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the "missile that do not fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th test took place normally at the . 
Ça is only at the end of the flight that Ça was again damage the equipment . 
It is clearly the force of the third floor of the rocket that exploded force 
This time, "Bulava" has taken off from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can precisely be launched from a movement immersed immergée 
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably just from a defective Bulava . 
By the rest , Norwegians did not doubt any moment that rest is a Russian rocket . 
The generals argue that this time, one cannot talk absolutely of failure.
The two first floors of the rocket have resisted and the damage has floors the third one only . 
In the previous cases , the engines have had failures on the first floor . 
Even if none of the test launches have gone smoothly , the leadership of the test launches Defence thinks that only 6 to 13 have test launches .

The company , according to Vaněk , decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for hours . 
Or they can receive extra for overtime hours or they can make December 28th a vacation day as a replacement and extend their New Year's celebrations , Vaněk said .
In addition to that all employees here on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch . 
Given that the extra hours were the most urgent and the warmer in the comments and the demands of unions and employees who have voluntarily stopped production in the last week, the management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for December, said vaněk.
Until last week, employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of after signing the agreement . 
The next negotiations between the leadership of the car factory and the negotiations should take leadership on Friday afternoon . 
The trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the strike in case their claims are met a joint document is signed .
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers spontaneously went on strike because of continuous hours . 
They were protesting against poor pay conditions and of alleged hazing .
The leadership defended itself with the fact that employees had to leadership supplement fact imperatives production cars . 
During the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions have also asked that the employees who have stopped production are not subject to sanctions.
The trade unions demand the society to reduce the time to the demand 
, they want this year a reward of 5 , 000 crowns about 209 for these ones .
The Hyundai plant of Nošovice currently employs 2 , 000 people . 
She began series production last year in November . 
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.

Czech discovery a substance that works on virus HIV too people 
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that could slow down the spread of HIV in the body . 
The main advantages of the improved substance is that it also acts advantages the virus that have already developed an immunity to advantages . 
This has , in some cases , the upper hand based on the fact that the combination does not act as intensively against the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available . 
It is not possible to recover from AIDS at the moment.
Nevertheless, we can extend radically the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
Their consumption leads , , to a number of side effects .
Plus, the repression of this increase brings about the development of so-called virus strain on which drugs do not have any effect.
The work of experts from three institutions , the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic , the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a to cope with the resistance of the virus . 
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are a patchwork of boron , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt . 
This combination is blocking the virus development in a different way than all the medicines used to date and therefore they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their routes on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three dimensional structure two multi walls cages are shaped by the boron atoms , hydrogen and carbon and connected by a atom , cobalt in this case . 
A traitor and resistant virus . 
The of protéase HIV is a protein of the HIV virus which protéase essential to the life cycle of the virus . 
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by protéase HIV the mature infectious particles of the virus would not develop . 
If you stop the HIV protease , you will stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body , explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Republic Academy of Sciences .
In their work published in the scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry , scientists describe a number of combinations where two pairs of cages see table are linked by a short organic link , which is then systematically altered . 
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the protéases HIV has been tested in test tubes and its variations resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as clinical medicine, however it does not weakeon on resistannt versions against which current medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other changes chemical compounds are so interesting to examine more to move towards the development of effective medicines against HIV, says pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Laboratory of structural biology, the Institute of organic chemistry and biochimie and the Institute of molecular genetics to the Academy of Sciences.

Dispute over the budget . The ODS Fischer , who defends himself . 
The President of the ODS Civic Democratic Party , Mirek Topolanek , is describing the budget ratified for the following year alarming and he believes the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence . 
The prime minister described the connection of the ODS as drastic verdict . 
He says he is taking time to analyse.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas declared that the idea spokesman an administrative official supported by the Čssd , the spokesman and Green Party did obsviously not work anymore . 
According to nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend at the House of Representatives support on the minority who cares to combat the ballooning deficit, or if he cares to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats regarding the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed . 
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday , however with changes tune up to 12 billion included by the left . 
The House has increased the money for salaries of officials, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that fact have been indirectly increasing the budget deficit . 
The Czech Republic should handle with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the room before the vote , playing with the government desire which means a modified budget is a better variant than an acting budget . 

# id=280
Disappointment and . 
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility , Prime Minister Jan Fischer indicated that the government will still consider the current situation . 
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the of changes , the situation could be different . 
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after its passage in government.
He said while he wondered if it would remain in office.
His disappointment about the around the negotiations is the reason . 
While Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit , Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD , who forced changes to the budget , do not have their place in the government .
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will quit if the Congress ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those that affect the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek the ministers appointed by the ODS are not question . 
This is the of the head of government Fischer and all the government . 
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing prejudicial , Topolánek emphasized in a written statement from the United States . 
He pointed out that the deputy ministers from some ministries themselves of TOP 09 , which voted against the budget . 
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the fight against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is entirely logical and reasonable that it is based on the majority of the left which is currently in the house."
That said, he should not expect support and tolerance from Democrats.
I was not considered and that it will be on the agenda and I will, said since the House to journalists, Defense Minister Martin barták elected government precisely with the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew off in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS backed down at the of the Prime Minister . 
Nečas stressed that the ODS probably would have voted on Wednesday against the budget changes if he did not explicitly asked the House Democrats to vote on the budget.
We do not have the feel of being orphans , we are not small children , feel responded to the question of whether the ODS had feel accusations criticized by president of the Party in feel House or in the country during the of the budget feel 
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that would follow in the months would be a bolchévisation house and destruction of all that was positive, sprung Topolánek in person.

The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk Jeseník will leave at two hours intervals . 
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up in Bratislava on 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kroner more.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport which will pay the railways next year a total amount of four billion kronor to settle the visible losses , the same amount as this year . The regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year , knowing that the État will account for almost three billion . 
This year regional trains are 200 more expensive . 
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always of one year.
The railways like the system , which also explains why they have not resorted to an in the price of the vast majority of transport . 
The changes will affect only the notes of a day Čd net and the Internet at lower prices eliška notes.
For passengers without a card , the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner . 
The price of eLiška will now depend on the journey taken , while before that it was valid between the cities of a chosen choice and had a single rate of 160 kroner .

The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood movie arrives in American movie theaters in the coming days ; the title is Invictus the official Czech title is Invictus Neporažený , it narrates a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela .
The role of the against world famous apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman , who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody . 
The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been cast to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas , return from critics and the public is cinemas heard . 
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela ; he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu , South Africa . 
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought , in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk .
He was the president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations as it is presented at a time when part of South Africa is in full preparations for the football World Cup, and because the media are troubled by disturbing news about the rise of racial conflict and discrimination of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority in power.
According to the agency Press , reactions to the new film are for agency moment rather positive in South Africa , despite the agency reservations expressed about the principal roles in which Hollywood stars strut agency . 
Morgan Freeman is , however , quoting his own terms , proud of the film . 
I have dreamed of this role for years, and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly met Nelson Mandela power as they say gain his energy , he said power the official official of the film in Los Angeles power 
I think it is a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and the message of Nelson Mandela . 
This is the history of the south african Republic , but it affects each individual , he added . 
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room which has given its creation to the people depicted the defender South African human rights during his term of presidency.
Morgan Freeman is trying during the film to reconcile two racial groups of a long divided country and like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he enters dressed in the jersey of the South African national team on the field of the World Cup tournament , which South Africa had won .
For showing up on the lawn in a jersey , which is seen in South Africa as something sacred , Mandela had been cheered at fourteen years ago mainly by the white and had been recognized by the white population . 
Let us hope that the Soccer Championship will manage to unite people once again as a single nation , said rugby player Chester Williams , who was in 1995 the only 'black' of the national team . 
It remains to be seen if the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The white South Africans , however , are skeptical as has recently confided , in an interview for LN , Christopher Dawson , fan of rugby who has fled to Great Britain .

Jančura will sue for libel against three chiefs of the Čssd 
Radim jančura, owner of student agency will file today complaint for slander against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against švejk Hašek of the region of South Moravia , against švejk Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of švejk Olomouc region , Martin Tesařík . 
Jančura said it in Dvacet minut of radiožurnál . 
The complaint is linked to the attempt of the society to operate regional railways in some regions . 
All regions, however, have ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czechs railways.
All three attacked us and say we made the people , while we only made an offer for people they wanted themselves 
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways which is not true because we know the of the Czech railways which have been signed last week . 
So it remains for us to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the society Student Agency , said Jančura to Radiožurnál slander 
Similarly, he said that he has evidence that no region has been in agreement with the European law.
We are preparing for that a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr Jančura's complaint represents the Švejk of his media spectacle , which is used as free publicity for his Švejk and himself . 
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and call the other chiefs to do the same .

He said that the campaign will target corruption at large.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to give the exploitation of rail links to the Czech railways , for an of about 150 billion kronor , without putting bidding forward . 
According to Jančura , acting in such a is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice . 
According to him , his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led threats from a member of the ČSSD to Jančura . 
The only threat was that if we did not stop , we could lose licences buses . 
He presented himself as a member of of the Čssd , I do not know who he is but I would not say his name , stated Jančura today to Radiožurnál .

The pneumocoques against the will be free and optional 
Vaccination against pneumocoques overturn old habits as soon as January 
It will be the first to be free and at the same optional for families . 
voices are already speaking up , saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more voices . 
The preparations for the introduction of free charge against pneumococcal pneumocoques culminent . 
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum price for vaccines that health insurance will pay for.
Specialists are also quite clear about the vaccination process . 
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children born in August.
Since January , children born last year starting August 2 can be vaccinated for free pneumocoques charge . 
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started having the vaccination last year or earlier , you will have to pay for the following yourself . 
The first dose of the vaccine must be administered between the third and fifth month of the child's . 
Last year already one quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated its children against pneumocoques quarter 
Yet parents paid 1,600 kroner, or more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses . 
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spend 300 to 450 thousand kronor on doses of vaccine . 
However, they save on medical care that non-vaccinated children would need.
Until now the State État spending about 500 , 000 kronor a year for all État spending of children . 
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package."
pneumocoques is the cause of inflammations of the middle ear pneumocoques also serious infections including inflammations of méninges poisoning pneumocoques . 
According to surveys in hospitals , up to 28 deaths of children under surveys years were caused by pneumococcal pneumocoques . 
À from the Czech Republic , about 40 other countries À introduced vaccination refunded . 
Will vaccination ? 
There are opinions regarding a possible mandatory vaccination in the future.
From January on , it must be paid by the À and optional . 
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His Association promotes since long vaccination against the pneumocoques . 
During an international conference in which our association took part, experts have not been really happy that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other Furthermore , we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this .
I think it is a direction that we now need to follow, said Kalovský.
But the health ministry does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumocoques . 
We are definitely not for the moment, said spokesman Vlastimil sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks , doctors . 
Hana cabrnochová , president of the Specialized company of paediatricians , acknowledges that a vaccine based on voluntary volontariata paediatricians shortcomings . 
If all children were vaccinated , we could consider a decrease of vaccination renewals . In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum , I understand the decision making the vaccination optional said however Cabrnochová . 
Experts estimate that starting next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
The vaccination against pneumocoques marks a break because it is the first pneumocoques vaccination , which is funded by insurance and not by pneumocoques État . 
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should free up funds for the prevention , they would economize on any future medical care .
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is , , linked to the concerns of paediatrician practitioners , which relates to the purchase of vaccines .
The original intention was to buy vaccines through insurers , the doctors intention the same way as other insurers products provided intention État state 
some deputies feared that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the sums from health insurance .
Thus , doctors will have to buy insurance products and wait for to repay them . 
According to estimates, paediatricians will have to invest individually nearly 40,000 kroner per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
Ça will be far from being easy , according to Cabrnochová .

The Labour is defending the increase of the budgetary tax . 
The ministers have defended the increase in taxes the spending cuts announced in the pré budget report , despite the criticism of the opposition , the companies the unions .
The Tories said that Alistair Darling failed to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit he postponed his decisions until after the elections .
The Chancellor also incurred by addressing the of low wages and average salaries . 
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 0.5% of the social insurance and a cap of 1% on the public wages from 2011.
The anger of Social Insurance 
The unions have protested that the low salaries are penalised by a recession for which they are not responsible and have warned that problems are looming . 
The loss of insurance sociale- who will get about £3 billion per year - has put the business world, angry, because he is a tax on jobs when the goal should be a recovery.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than 20,000 GBP per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
Main points of the pre Budget report 
The social insurance will rise again by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the expected 4.75% this year.
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The of the surtax on the benefits of society for small firms has surtax abandoned 
Tax rebate on electric cars and wind turbines.
Raise of 2 retirement 5 of the 
According to estimates of the Treasury , someone earning 30 , 000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and someone else earning 40 , 000 GBP will lose 190 GBP , while someone earning 10 , 000 GBP per year will gain 110 GBP .
The ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit before 2013 entailed difficult decisions they insisted that 60 of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5 of employees .
Stephen Timms, Treasury Secretary, has refuted an increase of the tax and pointed out that cutting spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be crucial over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that the economic growth would get going again at the end of this year .
However, forecasts of the Labour Party on economic growth - which will affect the amount that it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - have been put in doubt after the Chancellor has been forced to revise its initial figures.
In his speech , he said that the economy would probably decline by 4 . 75 this year far worse than the decline of 3 . 5 predicted in April while loan would be 3 billion of GDP over the prior estimate . 
"Missed opportunity" '
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the Labour Party's debt crisis , have argued that the project borrow 789 billion over the next six years was not viable . 
The ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to reimburse, they added, "cynically" dodging difficult decisions until after the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
They have not produced significant on what they will do , said Philip Hammond , Treasury chief secretary of the shadow cabinet . They had the opportunity to do it and they have missed it . 
The major announcements will be made after the election , whoever the winner . 
Roger Bootle Deloitte.
The Labour insists that the schools , hospitals and police will be protected from further cuts , unlike the Tory proposals that would lead to faster and more important of the deficit . 
But the Lib Dems have argued that the money gathered due to the taxes increase the spendings decrease would be used to support next year spending not to reduce the deficit , arguing that the plans were built on nothing .
Nick Robinson, editor of the BBC, said that the timing of announcements, such as rising inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned ci-dessus- would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, the money simply being retrieved the next year.
However , leLabour insists that additional assistance is provided when that people in greatest need and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010 .
"false budget."
Although ministers have not published the details of spending beyond 2011, economists have argued that it was clear that the restrictions on public expenditure would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies Institut Etudes Fiscales asserted that the figures from the Chancellor , imply in the future , substantial reductions in many areas , including potentially transport , higher education , science and defence . 
"The pain is in fact only delayed", said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, whoever the winner," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the Deloitte accountancy.
This was a pre budget false report . The markets are well aware of it .

The FBI said it was investing on whether that was the same men who had been reported missing from their home, in the US state of Virginia, the last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said that it sought information on these people .
Three of them are introduced as being of Pakistani descent , one legacy Egyptian and the other of Yemeni origin . 
If they are American citizens , of course we would like to know what the accusations are against them and under what conditions they are being detained , said the , Ian Kelly .

Amnesty condemns Iranians abuse 
These last twenty years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the report of the Amnesty International association.
The report presents "repeats of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
A man named in the report asserted that he had been beaten and burnt with cigarettes. Another declared that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the previous criticism about its of for human rights . 
The authorities said that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran , after the disputed dispute of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution of 1979 . 
Dozens had been sentenced to prison and the prosecutors say that at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne , BBC correspondent in Tehran , now in London , says that at the beginning of protests , the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse , ordering the closure of the detention centre of Kahrizak . 
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"false confession"
Amnesty International has related the case of a 26 year years computer student , Ebrahim Mehtari , who claimed to have been accused of working with the Facebook networks and protesting against the election results . 
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted as saying.
"I have been burned with cigarettes under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me".
After five days , he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street , still blood and a half conscious , said Amnesty . 
In August, the election's losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others have been raped.
The Iranian authorities have denied the accusations of rape but admitted that abuse had taken place . 
Amnesty has also mentioned the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has accepted that the Iranian parliament and judiciary create a committee to investigate the post election unrest and the government's response , but it claimed that the mandate and the powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public . 
The group has said that at least 90 people had been arrested, during the last three weeks, in order to prevent further demonstrations.

Can Islam be French ?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular State.
Roger Bootle Deloitte.
Some readers will be attracted by this new book , admirers of the author's last book Why the French Do Not Like the Headscarf 2006 , an elegant and well documented study of a problem that has divided and worried the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today . 
Mr Bowen's last book presents much web and much more ambitious . 
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques , in schools and in colleges which now provide in France what Mr . Bozen calls Muslim spaces for the 5 6 million Muslims . 
He knows very well to listen and replicate the debates between teachers and pupils on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim must marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the development and the gay rights be taught to young Muslims development 
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-musulman?
Could a Muslim a banking system based on interests for a loan ? 
These are this practical problems, he says, which are the everyday life, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam . 
The scholars and activists who have been interviewed by Mr . Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts , lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia , which nowadays are a small part of Muslims in Europe . 
I Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the religion of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of both side . 
He wonders just how much French politicians and the intellectual elite which is such an intense guardian of secularity are really committed to pluralism . 
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with the secular Republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of the core values".
Can Islam be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."

The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice composing it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
oil , gas , shipments and fishing are in the newly opened oil , with shipments , lawyers and now writers in oil wake . 
In On a Thin Layer of Ice , Richard Ellis , writer and illustrateur , a natural history of the symbol of the Great North , the polar bears . 
Aware of the history and complicated of whaling , he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were doing their evidence in the white bear hunting . 
The meeting of Admiral Nelson , then a courageous yearning 14 year years naval who had to fight with yearning the tip mousquet his , is certainly a yearning , but the rest is true . 
The young oursons captured when they were swimming alongside their mother which has oursons been killed , were caught and sent to zoos and oursons . 
In the early twentieth century, a famous was 75 bears.
Even today , the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the necessary surface for an adult living in the wild liberté Climate is rarely mentioned a polar bear living in Singapore has become green as a result of algae that grew in his thick fur .

Mr Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often mentions the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species.
Despite being banned in Norway , America and Russia , the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters in helicopter and Inuits on motoski use powerful assault to their . 
Ironically , it is in the fursthest waters in the North of these two hunt that the ice will stay longer . 
In his new book , After the Ice , Alun Anderson , a former editor in of the New Scientist , offers a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there . 
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphéristes nor océanographes can describe the exact speed of change . 
It is not for of trying . 
Late 19th and early 20th , travel pioneers travels gave the first information on the pioneers ice melting . 
The submarines from the cold war then mapped changes in the relief under this one.
The surveillance satellites and the sondes placed on the icebergs are of very help , sondes the bulk of work is done by tough men sondes camping in cold . 
Mr Anderson look at the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice dependent system formed by nets brackish water pressure by freezing . 
But the bear mentioned above with the microscopic marvels contained in the ice everything will be totally lost with the demise of the ice , scheduled between 2013 and 2050 .

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country , said the services of the American Foreign ministry . 
The national , who has not yet been identified , works for Development Alternatives Inc . , based in Bethesda . 
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U . S . Interest Section in Havana are trying to have to the detainee who was arrested on the of December . 
The specific allegations were not made public , although under the allegations law , a Cuban citizen or a visitor can allegations arrested under the pretext of being 'dangerous' . 
All the so called revolutionary activities , including moderate protests and critical writings criticism bring the risk of being arrest . 
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a bloggers community which gets bigger and bigger , led by Yoani Sánchez , commentatrice who frequently writes on the way are husband and herself are monitored and harassed by the government officials . 
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go receive prizes but authorisations have always been refused him . 
The detention of an American citizen will perhaps increase the tension between the communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which is pursuing a soft approach to improve relations with the island . 
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by The New York Times , arrest Friday evening . 
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by taking firm steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the US can reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba , although there are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average wage of a civil servant is 15 per month .
Just this year , the Cuban government accorded its ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones ; they are principally used text messages or for a 15 minute conversation , which corresponds minutes about a day's earnings . 
On the island , the Internet is extremely limited . 
It is available in the luxury hotels and visitors in the country and in some buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect must often give their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Of the few Americans incarcerated in prison , most are behind bars for crimes such as prison trafficking , said Gloria Berbena , Press Attache with prison U . S . Interests Section in Havana . 
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity which , in any other open society , would be allowed the of free mobile phones is a crime in Cuba , said Jose Miguel Vivanco , Director of the Americas Program of the group Human Rights Watch , which recently published a harsh report about freedom in Cuba , called New Castro , Same Cuba , referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel , his ailing older brother . 
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries are beginning to get a better dialogue.

The Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send troops in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities reported an organisation suspected of preparing a plan to send five men from Northern Virginia into Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped this would help to dismantle a significant network of terrorist recruiters plundering the Internet in search radicalized young men .
Investigators said they were chasing personality insurgente , known as Saifullah , who invited these personality insurgente Pakistan after having found them when one of them personality insurgente approving the waves terrorists on YouTube's video site personality insurgente Internet . 
they arrived in Pakistan , these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them get back to the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt , home of al Qaeda and of its terrorist training camps .
But a representative of the secret services in Pakistan that has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had not managed to convince the commanders of the al Qaeda that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
So they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha , far from the forbidden northeast mountains which had became a refuge for terrorists .
They were considered infiltrated agents .
This is why they were rejected , said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition to be kept anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case . 
The authorities' representative said that the men were determined and they are still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to enter entry the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces . 
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps more important, in determining the people who can be trusted.
Since the 11 September 2001 attacks , the American Intelligence Services' priority was to infiltrate men in al Qaeda al . 
The recruiters of the play the role of gate keepers , refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can turn out to be spies . 
According to analysts, the potential American recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets , and their propagandaire . 
However, Evan Kohlmann, expert from the NEFA foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also pay more and more attention in recent years in the choice of people that they accept as the American intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow its model of recruitment that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is on the Internet.

This event has gone relatively smoothly , although a small number of masked activists has lit some explosives close to a set of government buildings , located in town centre . 
On the day that little has happened during the talks on climate sponsorisées by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying there is no Planet B "and in Spanish, saying" the land said she has had enough '.
Several celebrities have joined the protests , including the Danish top model and photographer , Helena Christensen , who said that travel to the homeland of her mother , Peru , has opened her eyes on the heartbreaking problems déchirants country is facing because of the impact of climate change that is already happening . 
This is one reason why I decided to join the great works to spread the word and appeal to the leaders in the entire world to right fair , ambitious and committed decisions , she said . 
This isn't an easy task, but it must be taken, it is not possible anymore to avoid it.
Police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people because they were wearing a mask or they were in possession of pockets .

They were launching them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed later by "a few big explosions".
Inside palace Convention Centre , people were gathered around television palace to follow the throughout the afternoon .

When he was asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations , he said in English In fact , this is something I was not aware of .
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event being important, I cannot hear what happens outside".
He observed that march could seem harmful or useful , depending on the prospects . 
It shows the interest of the public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
Furthermore, 'You can also say they disrupt the talks or they are damaging to the freedom of others. "

The results of the tests show tenacious differences between races
The federal report last week on the results maths brought good news for public schools in maths D . C . 
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are showing much greater progress in the last two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (national assessment of progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white, both local and national.
The average results for white children in Grade 4 CM1 from Washington D . C . have risen over the past two years from 262 to 270 on a scale of 500 , those of their African American classmates increased by only three points , from 209 to 212 .
The achievement gap has actually risen between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 4th remains generally constant , falling just one point from 245 to 244 . 
The average result among was not included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently significant . 
The survey over a period of six years is no more encouraging survey 
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in the Grade 4 class (CM1), when the first NAEP district report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only decreased to 58 points.
Last week , some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the head of educational institutions group Michelle A . Rhee and the Mayor Adrian M . Fenty Democrat were powered by the white students who were already good things . 
It would mean that we have high the gathering in the elements on the high costs, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of D.C. voice, a non-profit group that defends the equality in education in the District.
I am not jumping for joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), a member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter was in grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the style of management of Rhee , Brown said that the message of the results of tests is that the middle schools colleges of the city are desperate for attention . Often critical of Rhee's management style , Brown said that the message from the results of tests is that the city's middle schools are in desperate of attention . 
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect this.
But what is frightening , is that we do not spend enough time and energy on our middle colleges . 
Rhee said that the district should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn , for example , some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method , the Wilson Reading System , which aim classes school and cycle middle school college who have not included the foundations of reading earlier in their school career and who are lagging behind their peers . 
Every day, the programme of mathematics, for kindergarten classes (Mother) to grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, such that they have been put in place in the district by the former head Clifford Janey must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions for these pupils who are below the level of their class,  Rhee said.
Others argue that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can keep raising the overall results of the system while providing with money and resources the schools with fewer good results in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California who studied the results of tests of the cities.
The conventional political solution is to allocate your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting can repercussions policies which this important program . 
But the problem , of course , is that like other schools , she is trying to use middle class whites and blacks . 
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our school districts so that all families, regardless of where they originate, should be confident that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey , now of schools in Newark , declared in an interview this week that one of the essential elements in reducing the success étaitla duration the traditional public school today , currently at 180 days in the District of Washington , to be competition with the charter schools . 
About 200 days are needed to have the strength to change , said Janey , who came to an agreement with his teachers union last year for 185 days , which he considers a starting point to yet achieve an increase in the next contract .

Turning higher education into a promise for the future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long sifflement . 
Graciela Rodriguez , 12 years comes down fall it cligne blinks point a view years the sight fall the white columns cligne facades bricks and leafy grasslands . 
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school , àel El Salvador . 
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in 8th Grade (fourth) of the group explored Gettysburg where school fees are $38 690 per year, her attitude was less one of a new impressed student than of an enthusiastic one.
Great This is where I am going to study ! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine , while the guides leading them towards the entrance of the building of science . 
Youpi, really? they songeuse when he made the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children visited during their three day journey days discovery and now , they had completely incorporated the message The question is not whether you are going to 
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely asked for the large number of American children born from Hispanic immigrant parents who have left the school or became parents they were teenagers , they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university system that will enable them to enter the middle class .
In fact , one second generation Hispanic out of five pursues his studies at the school if notable success you consider that both of his immigrant parents , for the most part from Mexico or Central America , entered the United States without having finished school .
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way for the following generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
The researchers who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high for their children and who find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with the American schools . 
Coaching programs also play a very important role to help Graciela and millions of children as her to reach university especially if her efforts are regular and on a long term . 
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied Latin-American students.
We must think to offer a support network for these children, from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program, which has funded the visit of the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the ERG up (prépares you), it provides more than $300 million per year to systems of local schools to organise programmes in preparation for the university started when students from families on low incomes are in middle school (College) and continue until the end years of school.
Since 1999 , the programme been followed by more than 10 million students , programme more than 60 percent going to university , according programme the US Department of Education .

The oil Ministry of Iraqi agreements with 10 foreign oil companies 
Despite the concerns about violence and political instability , the Iraqi government has managed to attract some major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday . 
The 10 agreements brokered by the Iraqi Ministry of oil with the foreign oil companies suggests that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry in Iraq, quashed by decades of war and sanctions.
American reparties are spread with a participation in only two of the 10 auctioned fields reparties 
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only who had made a auction has lost . 
Two American companies have received contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The weak representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors , after six years of war , and instead of American companies , it is Asian and European companies which are paving the way , said Ruba Husari , editor of Iraq Oil Forum , a site on the Internet . 
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security , reinforced by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday , and political while American military troops were withdrawing have slowed down the American oil companies , preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq which has the third largest crude oil reserves in the world , analysts say .
The American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because of their rivals , especially the Chinese the other government controlled energy companies , which had significantly lower labor costs which were more prepared to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders .
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that obtained contracts with the ministry.
The largest American companies , such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips , who kept strong links with the Iraqi oil ministry and brought them their technical advice , have reparties empty handed . 
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in company of the contracts awarded this weekend . 
Chinese National Petroleum Corp . , owned by the state , has raised more the on contracts than other companies and left with significant holdings in contracts for two major fields . 
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam jihad, spokesman for the oil ministry.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal with its competitors and fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The company pre selected to submit auctions made offers which company then compared to the price auctions barrel which the ministry company prepared to spend to auctions production above current levels company each area .

One of the main organisers of Al Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile which struck along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organisers of al Qaeda operations , this week , American counter intelligence authorities said Friday . 
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of rockets fired into their car , on Tuesday , near the town of Miran Shah , in the province of North Waziristan , according to American and Pakistani authorities in the region . 
Local authorities have said the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car , heading towards the Afghan border , when the car was struck , said a member of the Pakistani Civil Secret civilians , speaking by telephone from Miran Shah . 
The authorities said that the suspected local suspects rushed in and rapidly confiscated what remained of the suspects shattered bodies . 
It was completly impossible for local authorities to check the identity of the victims , the two American anti terror representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was one of the dead .
Somali was described as being one of the al Qaeda military organizers Responsibles who ran the terrorist operations of organizers group outside the Afghanistan Pakistan region . 
His role was to organize plots throughout the entire world, said one of the authorities, who requested anonymity citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its main role , this included probably attacks against the US and Europe . 
He has followed the strategic instructions of the leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated them into plans of action for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority has said that Somali had risen quickly in the ranks of al-Qaida and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the greater American public, but it does not diminish the threat that it constitutes for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed , Somali would be the second major figure of al Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September , when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov , leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt , as well as three other operators . 
The pace of attacks performed by CIA's has since the summer , of about six operations per months to two , according to the figures provided by the Long War Journal , a tempered website by a non profit group . 
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics from the terrorist groups that have progressed in to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing the suspected informants , the site says .

The special envoy to Kabul 
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extended during the presidential elections, supported by the UN.
Eide's departure happens as the Obama administration has decided to send 30 , 000 additional troops in Afghanistan . 
The UN envoy has said that he supported this increase , but he has expressed his concern regarding the timing of the United States for a withdrawal of troops which would start in 18 months and which would force the other governments of NATO to withdraw their forces . 
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan , send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they confidence trust the international community , said Eide in a telephone conversation from Kabul . 
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the US and the other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but that he would keep the commitment that he had made to his family, in March, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to inform the United Nations.
The Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my successor, said Eide.
When I came here , there had been a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival . 
According to representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The affirm that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited ; he is an Italian Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission to Baghdad and Jean Marie Guéhenno , a Frenchman who previously directed UN operations . 
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan has been hurt his former deputy , Peter W . Galbraith , accused him in September to favor President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hide the evidence of a massive electoral fraud .
Eide denied this allegations but he said that accusations to Galbraith which has been dismiss have damaged the mission because there was already a big dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of éléctions . 
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to co-ordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN Executives to allow his successor to hire more staff from the US and other Western countries than what is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan , saying that this would give them more confidence in the way their money is spent . 
Eide has expressed his frustration concerning the limits of his powers in Afghanistan , saying that the heavy regulation on recruitment from the UN disturbed gênaient opportunities to bring new talent . 
The UN's rules are such that I was able to recruit only one person since May , he said . 
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "serious additional sanctions" on Iran because of its failure to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates , speaking in forum of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq , for forum one week visit in the war zones in forum and Iraq , has played down the possibility of a military forum against the Islamic Republic . 
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of in such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs the most on me , is that if I learnt a thing in Iraq over the past six years , it is the unpredictable inherent to the war . 
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a package of incentives and punishments might be needed to persuade package Iranian government that it would in fact have worse package with nuclear weapons because his people would suffer greatly package these sanctions . 
On Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face the "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran keeps on saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience on peaceful purposes only.
In the Geneva talks , on October 1st , it indicated that it would resume the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a major part of its stock of enriched uranium , in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor . 
The administration has prompted such an agreement , a to develop confidence on both sides and win time for negotiations . 
Since then , Iran appears to have distanced itself from the attempts the agreement in part , say experts , because attempts Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to attempts with the United States . 
Frankly, I think the inflexibility of Iran with some of the international community where they had in fact agreed at the beginning in October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, to join on what they had not considered, in terms of serious additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set December 31st as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals , before he turns to other options , including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called accumulated sanctions . 
In a statement on Thursday in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it calls "the baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to get a long-term satisfactory solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late on Friday, met this morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region in order derencontrer Kurdish leaders of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the share of income.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid delays to American plans for the in the number of American troops , from 115 , 000 to 50 , 000 before the end of August . 
Gates also wants to ease the anxiety of Kurds concerning the pending . The American authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani , president of the regional government of Kurdistan We will protect your security , prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq . 
"We won't abandon you."

In an China , a change of direction 
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by displays of propaganda, "the preaching to the Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby, it is a grave and more."
They have so far learned the lesson that the authorities of Shanghai government, alarmed by the low birth rate in their city and the population ageing, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no second , said Wang , 31 years old , director of human resources and of an 8 months old son . 
More than 30 years after the introduction of one child policy in China , creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good joues and spoiled , nicknamed the Little Emperors' , a population crisis is threatening the country . 
According to the UN, the average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple less than six when the policy was implemented.
for the distribution of the population although it is envisaged that the number of residents greater than 60 years will explode from 16 . 7 percent of the population by 2020 to 31 . 1 percent by 2050 . This figure is well above the global average of around 20 percent .
That imbalance is even worse in the coastal rich cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai city population and family planning commission (Committee of the population in Shanghai and family planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies to 'help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a lack of labor in the future ".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
Written in the country's constitution in 1978 , China's one child policy is to this undoubtedly the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government . 
Couples who transgress this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination at the workplace.
The Chinese authorities missioned the duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend duty its natural resources , while lawyers for human rights duty denounced the abuse in implementing this policy . 
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced the pregnant women to a second child to have abortions.
Moreover , many couples have resorted to selective abortions , leading to boys abnormally girls boys girls ratio . 
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004 , they allowed more exceptions to the rule including for residents of towns , members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women already children only one and in 2007 , they toned down their harsh slogans quite a . 
Xiaochun Qiao, a professor at the Institute of Population Research Institute of Research on the population), at Beijing University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such that allow couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time at all , the posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced with copies of the regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to request request . 
The city government dispatched family planning and volunteers to meet with couples in their home , and to slide prospectus under their door . 
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of Family Planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing answer
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child following the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The of Huinan , with a population of 115 , 000 inhabitants , for example , still receives only four to five requests per month . 
Disappointed officials in Shanghai say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only around 165 thousand -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying , the in of the committee of family planning in the municipality of Caolu in Shanghai , said that the financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children . 
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, have said they adoreraient having two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider that the one child policy is a problem of rights , said Yang , a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the . 
It's true , they are robbing us of the of having more than one child . 
But the problem is not only the law.
It is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, chief human resources, said she wanted an only child because she was one herself. "We were the centre of the family and were used that everyone was looking after us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others."
Chen zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translating said it more bluntly.
For couples where both are working , middle class , who are lowering the birth rates , he says , one must be selfish pourbien succeed well . 
People between 20 30 years old have grown up watching their parents fight during the rise of capitalism in China they do not want to live the same way , he is quoted as saying .
Even one child asks a lot of time to his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space You need to change your apartment and planning when your child is only 9 months old , you must write his CV to obtain a place in the best mother . 
Most of his friends are ready for that experience once , said Chen , not twice .
Our generation is the first one to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We do not want too many sacrifices.

The UN group plans for emissions reducing 
The climate conference , sponsored by the UN characterised so far by disorganised désorganisées and mutual recriminations is back in the spotlight on Friday , because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years , with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near time . 
The text which could provide the foundations of a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has emphasized the remaining barriers, as much as it has lighted up the path to take.
But it was seen an important step forward in the negotiations which don't have much time left , with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week .
Written by a special working group from ONU , the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to cope with climate change , on course and long term . 
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the rise in global temperature that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives a great flexibility to the process , said John Coequyt , àwashington Representative of the Sierra Club . 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiations to 180 pages to concentrate on what has described the executive secretary general on climate change to the UN, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a potential agreement in which the industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, would reduce theirs by 15 to 30 percent.
Together , the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by country . 
The European Union has also revied negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to cope with floods and droughts or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal squabbling occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, representative of the US negotiating climate has rejected any discussion, forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming more tough toward China than the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States is not going to sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries , said Stern who also regretted that the text is not insistent enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside outsiders . 
Stern has made his comments one hour after the Chinese foreign affairs deputy , He Yafei had said that the principal US negotiator , lack lacked common sense , or was highly irresponsible for having said earlier that week that the US would not financially help China fight climate change . 
With the future economic trajectories of the main world powers at stake defects some appeared time within the Third World and between the industrial world and the Emerging Economies . 
The battle now is more relevant to the rescue of individual economies than that of saving the planet , with China and the United States hair cuts on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries are ignoring scientific need to act more boldly . 
Ricardo Ulate , a delegate from Costa Rica , said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases , even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big issuers accountable for their actions . 
This is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony , said Ulate , which is also on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International . 
Some countries which are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated they would continue to pressure for a legally binding treaty , in Copenhagen , although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead , at the least , to a political agreement . 
The Alliance of Small Island States that includes 43 states , has drafted a 24 pages pages proposal , early Friday morning . 
Artur Runge Metzger , director of the climate division of the European Commission , has said that the action of the small island states has put political pressure on the whole political process , in part they are now unified and are asking the emerging economies such as China and India , to act .
The debates have become an urgent urgency , while the delegates were focussing on the fact urgency they had to solve most of the issues pending before urgency heads of governments come to an agreement . 
High level officials such as Indian Environment Minister , Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese deputy minister descended from their plane and ran into the Bella Center building to attend meetings behind closed doors and information conferences , in order to make which will be considered in the of the following week . 
The real picture of the rally -- during which 13,000 people come in and out of the palace of Congress every day -- activists Guitare players with nightly performances, mocking the countries that they will reveal that the proposals are made and distributed on paper, rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than on Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys , said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez , vice president of Conservation International worldwide politics . 
The trucks are arriving.

In Great Britain , the first km h train will redefine the Monday Syndrome . 
To 5h13, on Monday morning, a whistle percera night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high speed commuter train will reach 225 km h , while it runs from Ashford , in Kent , to London's St . Pancras station , covering the 93 km in 38 minutes .
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes in the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Great Britain to include an international network of fast and reliable trains , and will link the large conurbations of Midlands , North and Scotland to London . 
The small holes, lost cities, suburbs will become successful, the Times of business travel will be far less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce the national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billion needed to build a new rail network , the inevitable battle of and fears of dangers to the environment may slow down the British high speed lines . 
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will turn in its report to Lord Adonis on December 30.
It will get a detailed map the route of the next step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign , the plan will be drawn up to 25 campaign of the final journey plan 
It is equally expected that HS2 presents three options for a larger high-speed network, go towards the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
Inside the options put forward in a format in which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will diverge into two at or near Birmingham , with one arm toward the west of the Apennines at Manchester and Scotland and another going toward the northeast , toward Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne . 
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems it will be the best option of performance", a professional of railways said.
When it is finished, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip of one hour currently.
The proposals will allow trains to travel to 400km / h, making the UK grid the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains of in length that are able to carry 1100 people . 
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can handle 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the space constraints, it is intended that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts of the rail industry say that only St . Pancras International or Euston offer this option . 
Lord Adonis will announce whether he feels the project must be put in place, but more lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if he launches the machine , the network will have to be built by . 
The trains will first have to drive out of high-speed lines on the rails exist in the north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best to ensure a from way to trains , constituting a reference point for the revolution way railways .

On Friday morning , his wife Laeticia went to the French High School in Los Angeles , scolarisée their daughter Jade goes to school , to attend spectacle school , an AFP photographer said . 
The orthopédique of orthopaedic and surgery of the Pitié Salpêtrière chief , Yves Catoné orthopédique announced that he would go to chief Angeles on orthopédique beside the singer . 
The producer has sharply questioned Dr Stéphane delajoux , the neurochirurgien who operated on the singer on November 26 at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris . 
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were outraged, Mr Camus said.
I have heard about a possible legal action to come, he said.
Jean Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday party left far too fast to Los Angeles , with the party from the Parisian surgeon . 
I had this doctor personally person the line , who assured me that there person no line for this trip and I was amazed person given line I have had myself two spinal hernies discales , person added line 
Shortly before on RTL , he had indicated that the singer had apparently party without combat , without nothing , after his operation in Paris . 
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known midst art . 
He operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he worked at the time.
In 2007 , he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hématome following a brain haemorrhage . 
But it is also a doctor to the reputation sulfureuse, repeatedly condemned by the justice in medical liability, and for tax fraud and deception.
Olivier Metzner , Esq tree , the lawyer for the order medical doctors , tree him of being a man order scruples pursued regularly tree the organization's Council , order who is tree from being recommendable . 
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention went perfectly well and the post operative tests intervention normal . 
The operation was not haemorrhagic and therefore didn't need to put a combat he added . 
In any case , the singer's tour , whose health worries increased since this summer , appears in parentheses . 
Quite evidently , a resumption of the Tour on January 8th in Amiens ndlr planned , seems much too soon , said Mr Camus .

The UDF association increases the tone and commands the new centre to stop using its acronym
The UDF association , controlled by François Bayrou MoDem , responded Friday to the takeover of the president of the New Centre , Hervé Morin , on the symbol of the former Giscardian giscardien requiring him to setting not use it on any back carrier , at the pain of prosecution . 
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym , judging that François Bayrou does not deserve to defend its political legacy after reaching out towards the left wing . 
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To press its approach , he received Hervé de Charette's support of ex UMP now in NC which claims UDF ownership for being the first to deposit it table 2004 in the National Institute of Industrial Property . 
But on Friday evening, the Bureau of the Association UDF, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not want to lose, is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and member, the request not to use the letters and transfer the ownership of the brand, for fear of prosecution.
You have increased , in recent days , statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement to resume using the acronym UDF , wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of bureau members , including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem , as well as Senator John Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance . 
You have also seen fit to place on your militant material and on the page of your site , the name of this movement , the New centre , and the slogan the UDF today , the signatories of the mail also note . 
As you know , you have no right to use this symbol , explains the UFD office which calls on the NC to stop immediately the use of the UFD name for any credibility well of its internet site .
He also asks Hervé de Charette to pass on the property of the to its legitimate copyright holders . 
If you did not do it , courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF , warn the signatories . 
In their letter they specify that UDF is an independent political movement since 1978 and argued that Mr Morin and his friends made the choice to leave it in 2007 to create a competitor , like others did in 2002 , to create UMP . 
The new centre did not have , according to them , any right to use the acronym UDF Union for French democracy .
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership to the modem for three years creating an office in charge of defending the material moral interests of education founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing .
As for Hervé de Charette , is pursuing the bureau , when he established the brand , he was more unites the UDF for three years' , but the UMP . 
He takes outrageously and fraudulently of the abscence submission of the UDF to file it on his account submission 
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils before mock, on the strategy of the NC: "It seems that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for themselves than to try to get out of anonymity by taking fraudulently a name that was not right '.

Liliane Bettencourt affair: françois-marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François Marie Banier to determine if , accused by the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt , he took advantage of the weakness of the octogenarian to steal part of her fortune .
The photographer of 62 years , known for his pictures of stars , will be judged on 15 and pictures April 2010 for abuse of weakness , a criminal pictures with a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment and pictures . 000 euros fine . 
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the families of France, where mother and daughter have been taking the reins of the empire of the Oréal cosmetic.
But the 15th criminal has also ordered that a medical expertise to Liliane Bettencourt , 87 years old , should be led collectively by three doctors . 
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an , not anyway under the terms proposed by the public prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation . 
The doctors named on Friday must submit a report before March 10 , 2010 , particularly saying whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been in a weakened state weakness during what periods . 
I think she will submit it.
I am going to talk to her about it, Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the exit of the hearing.
For his , the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers , Olivier Metzner , welcomed the court's decision . 
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady who must be protected, he said.
For two years ago, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt engaged in criminal proceedings against françois-marie Banier, photographer and touche-à-tout artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years to the weakness of his mother for a billion of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or pictures of Masters.
On her hand , Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by hand photographer , that she considers as a long friend . 
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action by Mrs Bettencourt Meyers , the lawyers' turned sometimes into the big family déballage on Friday . 
Thus , the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt indicated three letters sent by user in 1999 , 2003 and 2005 to her solicitor , in which she was saying she was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt Meyers . 
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: 'Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage."
The prosecutor of Nanterre has estimated that the testimony was not acceptable to act as a judge tutelles declined in recent days to grant her request to open a legal protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the full ability to act justly, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody else has to act in her place , said the representative of the prosecutor , Marie Christine Daubigney . 
The court decided finally that it would pronounce itself once the trial will take place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.

Managerial revolution or end of intelligence ? 
If nothing changes in the governance of the big French companies , our struggle for the development of intelligence will have been vain . . . 
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, recalls the position of companies from consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined to as high as it was used to impose the consumer products invented by the technicians from the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company , the marketing revolution has put the strategies of markets in place . . . although the authoritarian temptation to impose products unrelated to factors preferences customer customers returns regularly ! 
lack of employees can lead to a deadly . 
Suicides at France Telecom , PSA or Renault are only the visible tip of something much more general which hits particularly managers . 
These demobilisation seriously threaten the development of all of the company s intellectual demobilisation , including R amp ; D and , s more demobilisation its intelligence . 
Indeed, 'i movement "requires all the stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it needs by employees a commitment that revenue management authoritarian experienced completely.
This is why we call for a revolution managerial skills to set the staff at the centre of the company as the customer.
value relative views of internal investigations 
The investigation of domestic opinion likes the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés will it encourage this revolution in managerial ? 
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Firstly because I saw that, in a new situation, any structure is finally, after beating, primarily … what it has always done.!
Then , because authoritarianism one of the pathologies of pouvoir in proportion to the importance of pathologies own failures . 
Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
Coming from the great schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They are adopting , out of intellectual comfort , the old behavioriste , recently reactivated by American neuroscience and widely aired , without its , by learning and the media . 
, suggesting that it is possible to handle the levers sic of executives involvement , a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro . fr is it reinforces the leaders in a mechanistic governance position , inappropriate for the actual world .
Identify and measure the causes of action . 
Instead , the managerial skills necessary to the good functioning of modern companies requires skills to adopt a vision of human behaviour . 
It is to include , in any reasoning or practice of governance , a fundamental observation for employees , the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clear that the latter is a means of achieving of their dreams , their ambitions , their projects . 
Currently , only the studies arising from the Multifunctional motifonctionnelle adopt this view of the motives of the employees . 
These studies have shown that they think their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them through their image from the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their projects.
Thanks to the identification and the extent of the mobilisation factors , business managers can extent , foreshadow and anticipate their social performance and put their human extent management back on the place . 
they create a breeding ground for a concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence .

Oslo speech: the "just war" brings praises from the right to Obama
The American right welcomed Friday's speech on the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of America.
The Conservatives , who had brocardé awarding the prize to Mr . Obama on October brocardé , applauded this the presidential , like Sarah Palin brocardé former candidate for the vice presidency during the 2008 elections . 
I liked what he said, said Mrs Palin, égérie the right-hand side of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today ', adding itself addressed the subject of war' sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
War is obviously the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to, but it is necessary.
We must stop these everything over there , she felt . 
Mr Obama, who  inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr . Obama , Newt Gingrich , has estimated that the president has done a very good job in Oslo . 
I found the speech very good, welcomed the former president of the House of Representatives, who has particularly appreciated the mention of "The existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
In some side , I found this quite historic , said Mr side , interviewed during the radio programme The Takeaway . 
The former elected , regarded by some as a candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012 , said that he was delighted to have seen a president from the left remind members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not put a price on peace if the use to force did not exist . 
For Michael Gerson , a boxer George W . Bush turned Washington boxer columnist , Mr Obama gave a very American . 
In addition to representing himself as a citizen of the world as he always does , he spoke as an American president , reminding the Europeans that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they biodiversity do much to preserve it , Mr . Gerson said . 
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as being "dull, turgid and lacking inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
To the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When one connects the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press remained, however, laudatory toward the president.
The Los Angeles Times , while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama , has described his speech as superproduction even for an speaker known for his talent . 
The speech in Oslo should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against wars , poverty and oppression , the California daily flared . 
Mr Obama gave the speech he must , deemed the New York Times , judging it bleak and edifying at the same .

Reutirs three marathons for an agreement which saves the Christmas . 
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, sector unions Road and TLF employers' organisation, only to be stayed until the end, arrived on Friday evening in a deal that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
In the signatures on Friday evening , Dominique Bussereau , the Secretary of State for signatures , was delighted with this agreement which signatures reached after several negotiating negotiations that started on Wednesday morning signatures 
After a second night of debate the negotiators left in the early morning on Friday, with the hope to sign soon after the late morning the text of agreement.
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have closed the door.
But it took still more than six hours of a meeting began at 11 a.m. so that everyone agree and that at 6 p.m. the text is signed.
The conflict would have been very damaging for the companies and it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas holidays years Mr Bussereau . 
The text provides a salary increases of 4 for the lowest wages in the local increases regional road transport , and 2 . 9 increases the highest international road transport . 
In the hourly rate for low , we're going from 8 , 72 euros to 9 , 06 . 
It is not much , but we start very far away , said Patrice Clos FO . 
Tonight we will order to our activists that there was no obstacles , no blockade of the supplies centres . 
But there may still be some holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the senior salaries because of international competition."
According to him , the increases will be order 170 Euro euros for low wages and from 100 order 120 Euro for the highest . 
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees , Maxime Dumont CFDT said , while Thierry Douine CFTC welcomed a historic agreement . 
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has raised "a compromise acceptable".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses by 3 , maintaining the general state of road transport till the first half of 2010 , which will make it possible to address the issue of a 13th month modernization of the collective agreement .
Mr Bussereau reminded that a drop of 100 million euros in employers' contributions was the subject of a government amendment to the financial bill finance 2009 , voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly . 
The government will ask the Senate to vote it in identical . 
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies in the first time companies belonging adhérentes this organisation , and in the second , to the entire profession , in case of an by the Minister of Labour . 
It will "soon", has assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a fool's because the 100 million euros had already been promised for the sector to offset some of the carbon tax . 
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency , not in conclusion to a shared analysis , not to upset the turkey eaters for the next Christmas Eve , the Unostra complained .
For the Otre , the agreement the grave of a very large number of small and medium sized businesses in the next 12 months .

RER A disruption this weekend , trade unions unhappy with the RATP's proposals 
The disruption on the RER has the biggest line of public transport of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday in the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left on their hunger as to their demand for premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend shopping before Christmas, there will be trains between 10.00 a.m.and 8 p.m., at a train on two on the central section (between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture , which will force passengers to change . 
The Galeries Lafayette , who expect 200 , 000 customers every day , were delighted that the RATP is making efforts to serve the stores . 
The RER A crosses the city of Paris from West to East . 
The stretch runs from Saint Germain en Laye and Nanterre stretch Boissy Saint Léger and Marne la Vallée . 
On Friday , about a train out of two circulated at peak times , and almost no train hours peak , as planned . 
Like Thursday , there was no melee on the dock the Franciliens had organised themselves .
And in the morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, particularly because of lack of collégiens and pupils.
At Boissy Saint Léger Val de Marne , Jack Nbakina , an engineer for 29 years , explained that he got up an hour and a earlier , to be sure to arrive on time . 
The Saint Lazare station has not been saturated , said the SNCF , which had provided a framework of officials security forces . 
RER A operated by train from or to Cergy le Haut arrived or jaunt train Saint Lazare station to join the tube . 
New general meetings of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, found "disappointing" by the trade unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The RER director proposes to negotiate special protocol for the RER A on all aspects , working work , career etc . 
This is not what the drivers wanted , who demand a premium , according to Thierry Garon South . 
The RATP has even put to one side its premium proposals , cried out the CGT , stressing that the management was not able to solve a problem while it's done for the truck drivers and the SNCF . 
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader examination of the working conditions," the RATP said.
That made the trade unions say that the company was making fun of users of the weekend .
In the of the morning , some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris . 
This is when the leadership , which previously refused any discussion during the strike , had suggested for the order of appeasement the meeting . 
The conflict threatens to widen to the RER B on Tuesday , after a warning by UNSA and Indépendants . 
The trade unions ask for a premium of 120 euros UNSA to 150 euros with EUR premium variables CGT , FO , CFDT , South , premium and complain of the deterioration of the conditions premium that one million daily passengers line . 
The drivers of the RER , all in the second part of careers , have from 2 . 200 to 2 . 700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in premiums , for staggered , Sundays and holidays .

The Turkish courts dissolved the pro Kurdish party , a decision with serious consequences . 
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party of the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger by the Kurdish community, in the south-east and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "hotbed of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was unanimous in the 11 judges , while a qualified majority of seven was required to make the dissolution , said Mr Kiliç , adding that 37 party , including its president , Ahmet Türk and of Parliament Aysel Tugluk are banned from politics for five years . 
The judge has also announced the parliamentary immunity closure which was enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and confiscated party's assets by the Treasury .
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would be moving out of the Parliament rather than sitting as parliament members without a label . 
The decision follows a process triggered in 2007 by the Court of Cassation's prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accuses the DTP to obey "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered as a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political policy of the PKK rebels . 
The party assures however that it has no organic ties with the PKK but refuses to call it a ties organisation and calls for the government to negotiate with it . 
The court's verdict comes as the government has just reach out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to stymie the support of Kurdish PKK and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a collapse could lead to an escalation of tensions in the collapse south anatolien , where many demonstrations against collapse detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated collapse clashes with the police in recent weeks . 
Upon the news of the , a thousand demonstrators gathered in front news the DTP in Diyarbakir , the big city in news south east populated by a majority of Kurds . 
The police fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched Molotov cocktails or stones, with slings.
One hundred people marched in Istanbul .
After the verdict, Mr türk insisted that the court ruling would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue Kurdish ndlr by banning a party , he said to the ndlr . 
The government, formed by a party stemming from the Islamist movement, has also deplored the decision.
We are opposed by principle to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, minister of Energy Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a torpillage total of the Democratic opening launched by the government, has commented on the political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most lethal in recent months.

The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang brauburger , is a very harsh winter . 
But the head of service for too long and sablage roads (FES) makes it clear that this is not to annoy people.
This is simply so that the agents can test the vehicles and learn to control them .
According to métérologues , that could be for week . 
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle the snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan.
Mr Brauburger explains that when it starts to snow on Frankfurt city temperatures are below zero , winter services vehicles travel 20 main roads nicknamed A roads .
That includes the streets with a great of movement , the main arteries such as the Neue difficulties movement the Hanauer Landstraße . 
included are access for the firefighters , the routes of public transport , the pedestrian areas and the sloping streets as the Atzelbergstraße .
The agents of the FES begin their service at three hours the morning . 
If necessary , the 1 miles 040 roads of salt be salted with a road miles which roads well in 3 at the . 
This is why works at service begin at 3 o'clock in the morning so that service roads are clear when the daily service . 
Where it is becoming more difficult , it is when the snow starts falling at à7h30 . 30 in the morning . 
This is causing problems , the head of the road clearing sanding service says to us because no driver is willing to let the salting vehicles pass by .
Then , if it does not nothing anymore , we deal with the access roads and the network like the Rat Beil Straße . 
Secondary roads and latérales come last . 
Mr . Brauburger knows that it always causes a few complaints . 
At 5 a . m . , the pedestrian FES pedestrian is in motion to release first priority areas deemed dangerous and passages . 
As to the bicycle paths , the FES services cannot usually take of them . 
Mr brauburger specifies that there is in Frankfurt, a service spécialqui deals to monitor the state bridges between 22heures and 4.30.
the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces , the salting vehicles act as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees .
It also happens that the police call for help from this special service it is needed .

The birthplace of Dinosaurs 
The Tawa hallae looked like the other carnivorous dinosaurs this measured approximately 2 metres long by 1 . 50 m high , its members post were powerful , its elongated skull was equipped with acérées and curved recourbées , its terminaient arms cracks in sickle sickle and it had a long tail . 
If this species had lived a few million years later , she would not have had nothing outstanding . 
But , Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues report it in the magazine Science on Thursday , the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological features .
This animal was living 215 million years ago in New Mexico which was then part of the land émergées of the supercontinent , pangée and was near the . 
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, he informs us about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of these last.
It's in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt has undertaken searches with company paléontologues on the Gohst Crawford ranch site in northern New Mexico 
Randall irmis Museum of Natural History of Utah and member of the team searches have been told that they were sometimes find a dozen skeletal remains given in a day which is entirely unique for a layer sédimentaire dated Trias.
The scientists realised very quickly that a portion of remains belonged to a new species . 
The excavation have revealed the remains of five specimens . 
A discovery which confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs . 
behalf have named it Tawa after the word of the Hopi behalf for the Sun God . 
For Sterling Nesbitt , it is a quite exceptional discovery the fossils of dinosaurs from Trias are extremely rare and limited to a few fragments of bone . 
Not all the experts paléontologie this enthusiasm . 
For example Martin Sander from the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he adds that it allows us to confirm some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to state knowledge , dinosaurs appeared on Earth about state million years ago . 
Most of the older fossils , however , are fragmented and incomplete , which makes the classification of the very first dinosaurs a very difficult . 
The experts are wondering about what time the sauriens are divided into three groups of evolution: the théropodes (carnivores) who understand the tyrannosaure and vélociraptor emerged later and take the birds, the sauropodes, quadrupedal animals in the long neck, and those who are related and the herbivores ornithischiens which are part of the species such as the Triceratops and stégosaure.
According to studies by S . Nesbitt et al colleagues , Tawa studies one of the first . 
This case presents an interesting of features both primitive and developed case S . Nesbitt said . 
Researchers have found signs which suggests that the Tawa hallae had small air bags in his bones near the skull , have the birds that are the descendants of theropods .
These small pockets of air facilitate the breath of birds compared to mammals . 
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis , the Tawa is one of the oldest théropodes with small air bags in his bones . 
As the descendants of the immense sauropods also had hollow backbones with air sacs in them , one might think that their common ancestor already had that beneficial innovation .

Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs had lived in South America , researchers concluded that the sauriens had appeared over there . 
So the three main lines of evolution divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world ; that is to say the whole of the emerged land which formed the Pangee supercontinent .
It seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paléontologues has also discovered the remains of two other théropodes which are not particularly related to brethren . 
The three species can not descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers argue.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said that there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are a few inconsistencies . 
Martin Sander , paléontologue in Bonn said that there exists an even older paléontologue the silesaure , that lived in present day Poland and paléontologue belongs to a group related to dinosaurs . 
According to him that could give a distorted view because there is in South America a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while one finds virtually none on other continents . 
However , how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tétrapodes of the Jurassic era when they belong collateral a relatively rare branch of to the reptiles , is still a mystery . 
At the time of Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other sauriens.
Towards the end of Trias dinosaurs spread across the globe promoting the development of many new species, while others, that were related to them, disappeared between Trias and Jurassic.
Such a success is however not eternal.
To explain this transformation , Martin Sander sees two assumptions . 
There may have been a mass extinction to which dinosaurs survived randomly , while other reptiles disappeared .
the dinosaurs were better suited and they Then eliminate the competition on the ground .
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later , the fall of a meteorite fostered the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic that , since this time , were vegetating in the shadows it was mammals .

Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are the from teachers of the University of Toronto , the University of Cambridge , the University of Vienna , or of Berkeley in California . 
There are those of charge of the University of Naples , Quebec , Edinburgh charge New York , São Paulo , Berlin or charge . 
The evacuation by the police of the casino of the J . W . Goethe University in Frankfurt made waves around the . 
278 professors and other teachers , from the J . W . Goethe University but also from other institutions of higher education in Germany , Europe and North and South America , expressed their solidarity with the student protestors of the Westend Campus . 
In a statement written in German and English , they were condemning the intervention of the police requested by the committee of the university . 
Last week , University President Werner Müller Estler evacuated the buildings occupied by the striking students and teachers graffiti had been scrawled on walls and works of art .
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the damage did not justify speech someone from the police raid against the students and teachers who had organized their own way . 
The evacuation is an "unacceptable breach" of the freedom of research and education.
Focusing the focus exclusively on vandalism acts serves only to focus and criminalize the acts and is trying to make focus the mobilisation's . 
The Managing Committee of the University has evaded the debates that would be yet necessary .

Legitimation of the protests

We thank the president of the university.

We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU member of the Peter Beuth regional parliament.
The groups of the opposition party, the Greens and the left (left) did not share this view.
The CSU is making an excuse of a few daubed peinturlurés to criminalise the protests , Janine Wissler from peinturlurés La left Linke party said .

The party La left has filed a motion which the Minister of the left to submit a report on the conditions of the intervention left the police .

The S21 project an check Stuttgart 
We cannot put high enough the enormity of the Stuttgart 21 . 
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe."
If one wants , S21 is far more than the repositories of a railway station in the , more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden Württemberg into a dispiriting chaos despairing yards for a decade . 
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations with of the line approaches that ended in the of had a approaches at the time of being relics approaches 19th century that had the of approaches modern rail traffic because too much time was approaches to get the engines from the back to the approaches 
Arrival , short , departure that is what you have to do . 
This is why the front line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station of passing trains, which is half-way around on the main rail trans-European between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of putting the under station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant . 
Indeed, stations, the front line is more serious problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with autorails and voiture-pilote at both ends.
the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new route of the inter city line towards Ulm is triggered now .
The regional and municipal policies prevailed.
The company is of railways part because it is the taxpayer who railways the price of the risks of the largest infrastructure railways of the Federal Republic and not the public . 
From an urban point of view this project let itself relatively well justify.
One obtains an urban area that – according to the graphics of the planners generated by computer – will be very green.
For the rail transport the S21 is harmful . 
The station and the section enlargement are designed for a people traffic which was attribued and this is typical of the 1980s a huge growth . 
At the time the competition of cheap flights did not exist yet.
The policy of the modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the transport of goods since the railways is much more environmentally friendly by lorry on the road.
But the new route , with its leanings , is not suited to freight trains . 
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example , six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the Souabe . 
It is the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion is more realistic.
One thing is sure , in the next decade this money will be missed for other nodes and congestion in the network . 
The list of the Ministry of Transport mentions 60 large projects in all.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of a good 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 this line is built in slow motion.
It would really be urgent here to accelerate hard.
But the S21 project has the of a braking sabot . 
The Rhine Valley route is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic , it is happening in the very heart of Europe .

Accelerated election
Ultimately , has past faster than expected . 
Barely two weeks the sacking of the current holder of the post of chief editor Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German channel ZDF , the successor is already appointed .
The Commission wanted to vote last night to confirm the nomination.
Peter Frey , who runs the Berlin of ZDF , was the odds on favorite . 
The process has not wanted to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However , it seems that there was also the wish not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in if the proposal would not be accepted by the Board . 
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the votes of nine members of the Commission out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of the of this edition . 
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the board to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract five years, but it was rejected.
Only 7 of the council members had signed for the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against the impeachment by vote of Brender represented a failure of that needed to schächter.
Indeed , the CDU , which has a majority on the board had already suggested several weeks before the vote , their to renew Brender to his post . 
It is Roland Koch , the premier President of the Hesse Land , who had organised a league premier the editor . 
He had rejected the contract on the esteemed redacteur chief will be extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the emissions of information the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, lashing out at the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and felt that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have achieved nothing.
Peter Frey: who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4th 1957 in Bingen.
He has studied , and Romance languages Spanish . 
He then worked at the Südwestfunk radio body of Rhineland Palatinate and at the Frankfurter Rundschau German daily of national significance . 
In 1983 , he becomes an editor at ZDF , first for the news magazine heute journal a paper today . 
Then her journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy rédacteur-en-chef at the time; and corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, and until 1998 he was head and host of "morgenmagazins' (emission of information bimensuelle presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF and then head of Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized revue Medium Magazin , the Greens have announced they will put down a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch on board , the minister Rhineland Palatinate Kurt Beck , said last week that the states should change the intergovernmental ZDF treaty so that the intendant proposals of may not be blocked by a political majority biased . 
However , Beck has no plans to ask for the withdrawal of the politicians who are members of committees overseeing the ZDF .
Peter Frey , the likely successor to Brender , had ably manœuvré before the board by vehemently criticising the Commission's decision to dismiss Brender . 
Thanks to the evidence of journalistic independence, schächter was able to propose for the post of rédacteur-en-chef without losing face, the board was elected without the soupconne put a partisan politics.
In the representations of parties , Frey is classified as a left wing .

More than a note at the bottom of page on Herta Müller
It is with the words' arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control... "that begins a work of the poet Werner söllner, in which he thématise in slabs of phrases troubling, the experience of a dissident arrived in Germany who won the freedom but lost in its territory.
Werner Söllner , born in 1951 in Banat in Romania , was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and , subsequently director Collection collectors in a publishing house for young youth before settling in Frankfurt am Main . 
Söllner received various literary prize ; in 1993 he held the much coveted professorship prize Poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 prize he has been the Director of the literature forum in prize at the Mousonturm Artist House in Frankfurt prize 
He caused to talk a lot about him in non literary circles last Tuesday , at congress in Munich whose theme was German Literature in the Mirror in Romania and the Distorting Mirror of Your Securitat Files . 
Visibly disturbed and embarrassed , Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner , William Totok , Franz Hodjak , and Helmut Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an for the Securitate political police . 
In 1989 , price received the German language conjunction with some of price other participants . 
The recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971 . 
I am, "concludes söllner so someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the of honoration Nobel prize to Herta Müller for his exemplary literary star with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship honoration the literary scene is shaken , especially the honoration of German writers of Romanian , by a case honoration clearly shows the abyss and the heinous of honoration political system based on police surveillance and intelligence honoration 
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say based on current knowledge, not just guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitat dossier , Walter played a role , literature Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession and he referred to the positive influence of Walter , who had interceded on his . 
"he may had been able to get him out of difficult situations at that time", according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need moralde make this comment . 
The form in which söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant haven for Securitat spies Herta Müller had already written in July in the newspaper Die Zeit , having read the 914 pages of her own dossier .
We may suppose that the victims will have made speculation and will sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding behind the borrowed loans Sorin , voicu and also Walter . 
In contrast to Germany time consultation of the Stasi is a time process for the , the attitude toward the legacy of the time files is still very confused . 
A systematic investigation has been repeatedly frustrated and slowed down in the investigation . 
This is that in 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work the assimilation of archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of cases has dragged on since.
There is, since 2005, a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitat in Romania is still considerable , is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitat of Temesvar who , after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller , spoke in a very disdainful way about the winner . 
She had a psychosis , ultimately they only questioned her once .
The shame of power felt it could express itself here , without any gene shame under the guise of freedom of expression . 
Certainly , many unavoidable questions are involved in the Söllner case , as so often happens in the context of guilt cover up . 
Why now ? Who was robbed ? The measured reaction of listeners to Söllner's gives us hope that the next chapter will be defined more by a desire than by accusations and a sense of shame . 
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, which received the Nobel prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom of page.

Uproars in the Champions League 
We had the impression that a representative was coming , right to the coming straight from a nice Christmas celebration where a sporting goods manufacturer had displayed his when the new VfB coach Christian Gross showed up at 11 45 in a Mercedes C Class he had just called for , with an orange bag from the manufacturer in his . 
The man , whose bald chauve drew the attention , allowed himself to be led in chauve city which was still foreign to him . 
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could take the wheel – it was not drunk alcohol and it was not intoxicated happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow he had to go back to work . 
Because it is now that it would start.
The words of the Swiiss that we just hired three days earlier were clear We have indeed reached the before the , that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3 to 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success . It will be a rough struggle not to drop again . 
The "tough work" awaits us on Sunday.
There, it comes to daily repeated in Mainz, the results of the Champions League.
And the weaknesses which have been dug out after the three punishing goals from Marica (5.), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11) have to be overcome.
Draw of a 
The eighth League of sixteen match go 16 eighth 17 . 23 . 24 February return match 9 eighth 10 . 16 . 17 . March will be eighth on the December18 . in Nyon . 
The sudden office taking's joy fulminante Babbel's successor was finally moderate . 
And the joy was not moderated only for those who had brought them chance , who had transmitted to the destabilized Stuttgart an unfailing and fun to play . 
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should concentrate on their strengths, I have advised to be more courageous, expliqua the plumber 'souls' – Gross, the recipe for success that was so bienmais which was more effects with the soigneur Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic , confessed Jens Lehmann favour of Babbel , football when there is a new impetus things happen sometimes that one would never have thought possible . 
And Sami Khedira who , after weeks of pause for injury , avança best player in the thanks to its dynamism , tried to describe the phenomenon seen by a proverbial fresh wind and the of the new leader It is someone to go into action and requires discipline . 
This is what we need in the current situation".
But apparently Babbel had lacked some.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the course , warned manager Horst Heldt 
For the moment , VfB Stuttgart is mostly in need of tenacity . 
Just as Gross , the players and the manager about overstating the victory against the completely exceeded and date defense of the Romanian guests . 
They had also won in Glasgow before having had , four days later , a rude awakening in Leverkusen with the 0 4 , objecta Khedira . 
Horst Heldt , the manager , signala that they had actually reached one of the objectives of the signala but there were others which were still very far off signala 
We have not yet passed the difficult hurdle.
That Heldt the day of his 40th birthday was not the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, is at the weekend's events as a television interview of the Guardian of Jens Lehmann did pick up just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make not Jens , countered Heldt , in response to Lehmann's acerbic criticism .
He had accused the direction of weakness in style and said that it had decided to change the coach under pressure from pubescent pubertaires . 
Lehmann was judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele his day of free after the game he was removed.
The statements of Lehmann were marked by a pure Heldt and announced the consequences for the . 
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragénaires . 
In any cast , they were in agreement about rest , which cast to say that without the previous work on the group cast the replaced coach , the strong and aggressive sports cast would not have been possible . 
Babbel his assistants played a large part in the success retorted Heldt Lehmann in unison even the man with the plastic bag agreed .

The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among patients with psychological health or under the effect of drugs , that the health between fantasy and reality become blurred . 
While these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our darkened bedrooms, we can give ourselves over  to dreams and to the wildest fantasies without any barriers.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has quickly reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices only appear among those who patients mentally ill or under the effects of drugs . 
It is our imagination that is involved it is the same neuronal activity which allows us to design houses , paint pictures or write novels , which sometimes causes the boundaries between dreaming , madness and reality to merge .
A state of conscious , taking the shape of a dream , can present itself in the most diverse , called in the best of visions , in the worst madness . 
But even if the cause and effect distinguish themselves, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs in the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda member drawings of chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to the process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of substances in neurotransmettrices brain first and foremost dopamine , noradrenalin , serotonin and achétylcholine breaks and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted . 
Complex délirantes and delirious thoughts are very often present during schizophrenic délirantes . 
The pull has no more power over the person . 
Since Antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked into the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle , hallucinations were a form of daydreaming ; Wilhelm Griesinger , one of the of modern psychiatry , noted in 1861 , a great similarity between madness and dreaming , for Sigmund Freud the dream was a psychosis , with all of the irregularities , , delusions and sensory illusions that go into one . 
We are in the autumn of 2001 when Henning T turned into a figure of a comic strip.
His dimensions is two dimensional criardes screaming colours . 
earth has no more power over him , he attraction hovering close flood the ceiling . 
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged evil creatures , earth , grimaçantes a bloody , showing their teeth earth 
They are chasing him , kicking feet with heavy blazing boots , flamboyantes him against the feet , he feels pain his all body . 
Thundering , evil , howling howl , coming from the voice and the radio . 
He can no longer bear these voices that and humiliate him . 
Henning T . rips two cables from his chain stéréo , makes a from circle and attaches it to chain crochet set in the ceiling . 
He climbs on an baffle and puts the circle around his neck . 
He jumps.
The circle is coming off . 
May this teach you a lesson , the voice in a chorus to tear the tympan . go voice a clinic and go cure yourself ! 
Today Henning T. 40 years he lived six psychoses acute, the last 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis paranoid , schizo affective psychosis , in addition he is manic depressive , he takes medication for depression , mania and schizophrenia . 
He has learnt to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the fear I experienced terrible fears terrible and despondency despairs fear 
Illusions are a harsh reality.
Around one percent of the population suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their life ; in psychiatric hospitals it is the most common illness after depression . 
In a schizophrenia crisis , people can no longer make the difference between the inside world and the outside world , they are in a state of strong excitement , which makes that they may suffer from hallucinations , megalomania , relationnelle or persecution . 
It is very common to hear voices people which , which comments or dialogue . 
Optical hallucinations are not rare either . 
The affected person can no longer distinguish between what is important and what is insignificant , the brain can no longer filter the disruptive troublemakers , the conscious is flooded with sensations . 
Just like the dream , the hype opens the floodgates to a tide of ideas and hype that emerged from the deepest layers of conscience . 
The perception of reality in hype is focused on the subject , according to Professor hype Fuchs , head of department of psychiatry of the University Hospital Center hype Heidelberg Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum . 
The schizophrenic is in the centre of the situation , has a that is focused on him . 
Meanwhile, he is in a passive role, it is a dream, overcome by the events and cannot act on them actively.
This is the why often feel threatened , watched , manipulated . 
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality , illusion are a harsh reality , to wake up is excluded . 
To experience a hallucination once in his life.
Unlike the dream , according to Fuchs , the sensory and space structure of the reality that is perceived during the hype , is fundamentally preserved . 
Thoughts and delirious délirantes are based on reality , lived alienation happens in délirantes real framework . 
Why our brains does this kind of antic , is still a brains scientists . 
Exceptional everyone can cause one to momentarily lose his or her perception of reality , according everyone Fuchs . 
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia , but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only factors . 
Researchers suspect that the involved tiny brain damage . 
We assume that the neuronale maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early neuronale of development , for example by a viral infection neuronale the mother during pregnancy , Fuchs explains . 
But what is still unexplained , is how the anomaly of the neuronal happens and also the fact that it does not happen for many years . 
The environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, however, if there is a predisposition.
Hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters .
When our brains up . 
What is crazy , says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotiques suffer from hallucinations and take their costly medicines to unravel them when others are buying very expensive drugs to obtain them . 
The perception of pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a point of view.
For ten years , Kasten has collected reports about hallucinations the phenomena relating to visual delusions last year he published his findings in a work entitled The Imaginary World In Our Heads .
Hallucinations are of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other diseases . 
One among them psychological problems as borderline or depression but also headache , problems , borderline sclerosis , Alzheimer's disease traumatic trauma crânien . 
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations. 
The hallucinations , according to Kasten , consists of fragments of memories that are normally inhibés . 
They take shape when the areas of the brain which deal with sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently curbed ; when our brains heat up , but also when there is lack of stimulation . 
Drugs can trigger this state, as well as a brain injury or a psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus too , stress , misery love or other exceptional mental states . 
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledges having had at least once in his life the experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives a small town of Pomerania earlier and it goes to school.
A girl everything normal to tell the truth . 
If the images and voices weren't there.
In the playground, it is that a young boy, thin, with long hair châtain, send him to speak.
When she answers him, her comrades look at her, surprised – nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this timid girl is a rêveuse lunatic , but Sarah K is not dream , she rêveuse certain about that . 
She is awaker , hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to her on the bench . 
She can even sense his presence temporarily.
It is a pleasant feeling , she finds this sympathetic . 
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows very well that this and the other models are not real and that they will disappear again models 
By outbreaks , are generaly frightening . 
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When she is in class , sometimes she cannot follow the course because , to her eyes and ears , the professor seems to be introducing a new when who is invisible to the others , even the professor is obviously in the midst of explaining some equations at the blackboard .
By night, the outbreaks are, generally, frightening.
When , in the darkness of her house , she awaits sleep , which happens house rarely and far too late , she often cannot house if she is awake or dream dreaming , house the images she sees , grinning grimaçants or house girl with sanguinolentes cuts on her arms and her legs are in house of her open or closed eyes . 
Leave me alone, she cries at the creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to his parents or friends, she would be taken for crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her box last year and she lives with her friend . 
One year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since she contact via Internet the psychologist Kasten she knows well that contact is not insane . 
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough incentives , the likelihood is high that he will have hallucinations after some time . 
I suppose that the brain not being occupied enough , makes sure that there is in there . 
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played all alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age years , that the man she had called Daddy , since years was in age of , was not her real father years 
This is the same brain areas that are active in the visual hallucinations and noise, and the impressions and there are real, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah k to make the difference between the illusion and reality. "every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are images that form in the brain , which is why they seem so real .
For night , nighttime dreams are also a form of hallucination night 
The hallucinations of healthy people are no different fundamentally from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike , the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are pictures real . 
This is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is a only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience we unfortunately  quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for ailments, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg clinic and chief doctor of psychiatry and psychotherapy of the  Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a very serious illness , painful but also with something positive and creative in it madness is a work of art of despair . 
Schmidt Degenhard has studied the form of experience called oniroïd , a specific form of the amendment of conscience about by dreaming . 
Oniroïd oniroïdes are very complex dream like which are perceived oniroïdes real by the who experiences lives and which he cannot differentiate oniroïdes dream even when state is awakening . 
The oniroïd state of oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as in patients with who polyradiculopathie while fully conscious oniroïde paralysis . 
According to Schmidt Degenhard , when a human being is threatened with the loss of his and his world , due to a total and permanent failure to move , he replaces this real situation which disrupts his life with his own fantasy world disassociated from reality . 
It is a state of mental limit between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality , a change in the world has taken place the real situation is represented in the imagination .
It is a form of resources and interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, the ability of organisation which is given to men, not to sink in the ruins of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories.
Peter Classen Cornelius from Zurich and art historian also describes his oniroid experiences in his book Change of heart an action to safeguard the soul .
He was 49 , when his awareness left for a several days journey after the operation of a corneas with a transplant , , his body was doomed to stand still being resuscitated .
Claussen plunges into a world which he has created , foreign places , trip in time . He sees himself as an old man bed in a rail , a robot at his mind after his care . 
He lives during the Middle Ages among who manufacturing drugs based on blood . 
It is kidnapped by a Greek to Moto who goes in his country, it surfe with his hospital bed in the névé the Alps and meeting a Korean Mafia.
He is completely absorbed in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these interior travel differ fundamentally from any dream . 
The dream is a completely different , he writes describing what he has lived . 
Instead of dreams, the memories from the mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
You could even say that they are much more distinct and intensive than true live experience.
The intensity of this experience the horizon of our other everyday experiences , according to the psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard 
Ultimately , oniroïdes delusions , psychoses , hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us psychédéliques fragile our interior representations of outside are , even in a waking . 
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experiment that can be quite enriching .

Burda
At 27 years old , the children will continuation over the publishing house . 
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda editions is an interim solution in the long term , Hubert Burda hopes that his two children will take the press group over , he told newspaper . 
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will lot at 27 years old and are firmly committed to integrate the lot , Hubert Burda , 69 , said to Spiegel . 
All details have been settled in advance.
The question about whether or not they will be active in the company will be asked later on.
One will also have to see if they are able.
We cannot impose their children to 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to look at it.
This will demoralize children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that it is pulling out of the post président-directeur-général in January and that his successor was paul-bernhard Kallen.
Kallen , 52 years of , has been a member of the board since 1999 . 
He was primarily responsible for the technology . 
Later he held the Treasury department that is to say he was responsible of the company capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure he took the head of the marketing , the foreign department , the printing and the finance .
And for the first time it is not a family member who is head of Burda Editions .
Burda's children are respectively 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
The nommination of Kallen also serves to make the connection for nommination next 10 or 15 years . 
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
ruins has always taken place in the families who have let themselves ruins led by a desire for capital , who have ruins enormous speculation by thinking that they could always ruins higher . 
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had one universal power , said Burda . 
I am absolutely not in the role of précepteur as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of the leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.

Madza intends to prove that sport spirit is not angry with environment respect . 
À this effect , it has just added to the À the engine and start system À i Stop , a device which , at least À the moment , is available only on the 150 À 2 . 0 gasoline engine . 
This second generation of Mazda3 is known for the note it has received entirety . 
The details , the finishing of the vehicle , the board , the behaviour , the mechanics , the i board system . . . 
All these aspects are noticeable in the new Mazda3.
Starting with post driving conduct , it appears that fronts front seats post workplace ergonomics and . 
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the whole formed by the Board of Control and say, we see how saloon has continued in the trend of Japan to create a futuristic design of interior, with many buttons and orders, and the vivid colors, red and blue.
This style reminds us , partially part of the Honda Civic . 
It is why we can say that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic , both Japanese , contrast with the of German products , particularly the Volkswagen Golf , which everyone wants to overtake . 
Continuing with the systems , this Japanese compact car offers a board more systems sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a systems level of comfort . 
In addition to all this a large boot with regular . 
The system of automatic and start the engine, at least for the moment, is available only on the gasoline engine of two litres and 150 horses and change manual of six speeds.
This engine is a true happiness . It is shown in its finesse , its happiness noise , its benefits and consumption control happiness 
Indeed , although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models , those who do not do a large number of miles per year should not rule out this i Stop with motor , both for its great comfort and for its controlled consumption . 
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sport, meaning the one which offers the highest number of series elements.
Among the series, the assistant to change of direction (RVM) who kills the spot, the controls of traction and stability, the regulator, the mirror inside photosensible, on-board computer on a screen of large size, the parking sensors, the air conditioning independent, the capteur of rain and light, the Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and the wheels of alignment of 17 inches, are particularly remarkable.
Moreover , as if this equipment weren't enough , this version had the Premium pack schedules which , for 1 , 500 more , includes , among other , elements xenon adaptive headlights and an audio system with a Bose . 
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2 . 0 i stop is one of the best compact cars in its . 
It is especially demonstrated by the quality of materials used , by his behaviour and by his high level of . 
Moreover , those who do not travel many miles per year will be able to choose the i Stop version only associated with the gasoline 2 . 0 engine of 150 . 
The only drawback of this model is its high price , which cost between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finishing and 23 270 Euro for the tested model , the sport .

FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism which only allows you to look at your e mail , mechanism offering the possibility of seeing certain type mechanism attachments or surf the Internet . 
It took of its five minutes of glory in the United States when TIME magazine named it glory of the products of the year . 
In truth, it is more difficult to see him in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones , Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription less than half of the , for example , of a data for an iPhone . 
Given its success , the company has launched two new devices one designed exclusively for Twitter , the other with a free data life , six times more expensive than the Peek . 
Fonpeek , presented yesterday at the Le Web event , is the invention European version and its third incarnation . 
It is just as limited as its American big , but contains a surprise . 
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what is the fact of the data when you cross a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection to FON) to check his e-mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive it makes a long time that it should work .
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and options, but for me, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable  roaming fees across Europe have been barely perceptible.
À one's native home , one people to use the À , and home not wrong people 
That a small device like Fonpeek it is always funny that it is called FON when it does not have WiFi offers this kind of fare , means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various suggestions that help making their data network profitable .
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download of books and other research on the Internet.
Without a subscription and without any soup . 
It is piece connected and one pays at its purchase piece not every month . 
And this is what I hope to see a day for the fonpeek: an option to purchase with access to life as the Peek is already the États-unis.
It's not that I want to buy it.
I read my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish for it simply because I believe that it phrase a more fair for the consumer . 
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.

Michelle's favourite colour
Yellow is probably the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States . 
She went to the United States presidential inauguration of Barack If with a dress a coat of this color , in effect she chose the same to accompany him in the second instance , without doubt the most important of his life the awarding in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize .
Michelle Obama was wearing a model very similar in those two occasions in addition to their resembling ressemblante , drawing a yellow to green with bright reflections , both times , consisted of three parts the penitent , the jacket and the coat , in the same tissues , and was ornée of a broderie and a string . 
So at first glance , it seems that the first lady of the United is following the aftermath of the Princess of Asturias and chose to get the same . 
But the fabric from which the two sets cut fabric them very different . 
she wore a heavy lace fabric for the however , in Oslo she wore a printed velvet .
The accessories are also different green shoes with for the first , and a similar , but gold trimmed , this time . 
The hairdressing has changed too The hair is now raised while she was having it undone last time .

75 of working mothers have had professional problems because of their professionals 
Discrimination at work has risen in recent years , especially for the young women people who want to be mothers . 
It is that the study "fertility and career women in Spain," carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto the Mujer.
The inquiry , carried out on 9 737 women from 15 to years , leaves no for doubt 75 of working mothers have seen their careers limited because of motherhood . 
The study indicates that there are many differences having to do with the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not and the type of employment.
Those who do not work outside the home , work part time or have a less stable , get married couple , have their first pregnancy sooner and have more children . 
On the other hand , women having a stable job , mainly in the public sector , entry entering a couple and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children . 
Women between 35 and 49 years of with a work sets have their first child , on , 3 . 7 years after becoming a couples . This figure rises to 4 . 1 among those who work in the public sector . These data show that women who had a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it , which led them to delay the union and the arrival of children . 
The type of job exerted influence largely motherhood, but not the beginning of life together, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor which widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the investigation , level more training are educated , the more they marry level have training first child later . 
The difference remains even among women of the same generation.
For example , in the group being between 35 and 49 years old , those who have had elementary and advanced have become mothers for the first time respectively at 25 . 1 and 32 . 1 years old on average . 
Another disctinction also appears among women , according to their disctinction studies . 
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done studies of average level or above reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Mrs Delgado.

Last week, my mother, who has about 70 years ago, last days strolling round in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent as part of it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the APS and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two shots of feet which left the dog seriously injured.
Our outrage is huge because we do not see what outrage fun in gratuitously charge a small defenceless animal outrage , moreover , was on leaves . 
One must add the outrage of a lady who was quietly passing by and who , when she injured these individuals , came to fear for her physical well being , since an oddball who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , an elderly person or , ultimately , any person weaker than him .
The episode happened around 5 p . m . , on a normal Tuesday , in an usually quiet district . 
The gémi moaned all day . 
Of course we filed a complaint at the neighborhood police station even if we doubt that much will come of it , and , we don't want to offend any sensitivities , we just want to say that the cowardly killers were Spanish .
Outrage led us to denounce this fact . 
We do not understand what is happening among young people to find amusing to mistreat animals without charge, a defence which gives us love, friendship and keeps US airline.
We don't know where good education and respect of animals and people has gone.

Michelin and Festival , sets for the wearing of the headphones 
The tyre manufacturer Michelin , in collaboration with the Spanish foundation for road safety fesvial , has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets , mainly among younger motorcyclists , indicated it today both structures .
This initiative aims at raising awareness of the importance of wearing a headphones , since it is the only element of protection to prevent injury to the head , or even death , in a two wheels accident . 
Michelin has indicated that this line showed its commitment to road safety which goes beyond line design and manufacture of safer products , and said that line contributed to this goal by other actions of an educational line informative . 
This new campaign of encouragement for the port of a helmet when on two wheels , with the port to be or not to be , will include port first phase during which posters will be distributed in port than 500 motorcycles , in order to port the widest audience .

The sale of light commercial vehicles is improving
After nearly two years ago, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain for an increase of 12 . 6 compared to 2008 and , more important , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to figures from trade union business sectors the manufacturers Anfac and ganvam , the dealers . 
However , it should be set against the good news , since the yardstick used for comparison , the month of November 2008 , has been particularly bad , with a decrease of 60 compared to the previous year . . 
As a result , despite last event , registrations accumulated during the past 11 months are event below those of the previous year . 
Since January , if you add all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles of cars , pick ups fourgonnettes fourgons small and light trucks 95 , 853 have been sold . 
The big clouds that affect their the requests have not dissipated . Indeed , although they are requests bought by individuals , most of the purchases are requests by small or medium sized businesses , which pay requests almost 100 of the cases thanks of outside funding . 
And , besides the restrictions implied by limiting bank loans , we have to add other factors such as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation .
Dealing with this situation unlike passenger cars , purchase aids of 2000E have been little used .
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and the small businesses which want to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly under 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer,can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday , at Ganvam , they brought up again the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and to industrial vehicles lorries and buses . 
The Dealers Association foresees a 2010 similar to the year that is ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.

Emergency assist is now mandatory 
As has occurred with the ABS anti lock braking system , as will be the case with the ESP stability control , systems to aid in emergency braking will be a compulsory element in European cars .
They are already mandatory in newly registred cars and light commercial vehicles , while a period for the rest of weakness has been set until the end of February 2011 . 
The measure , imposed by the European Union , aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if , by its mode of action , it can also help prevent many rear shocks . 
Emergency assist pressure on the brakes in assistant cases detected by the system to the brakes assistant by the driver . 
But this last one does not maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch , the manufacturer of cars components , a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brake before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force . 
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid , , requires the maximum from the brake system , reducing the distance the car needs to stop .
According to an EU study , if all cars were equipped with type elements as many as 1 , 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year . 
This reduction would be even more important by popularizing the so called intelligent emergency braking systems we estimate that one with out of four would be avoided . 
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing pressure on the putting, if necessary.
If he does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the facility exert the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
