<p>My first degree was in Interpreting and Translating, following which I worked as a Conference Interpreter for the European Parliament. This involved interpreting for a variety of meetings which gave me a wide general knowledge and good analytical skills. My working languages were French, German and Finnish. 
I subsequently undertook an MSc in IT (Software and Systems) and worked as an analyst programmer. I have extended my
software development skills while working on a number of cutting edge products, ranging from smart card applications to Jini based information portals and, extensively, loan application portals. Having worked for startup companies, I have a wide, varied skillbase and a flexible approach to working. I have subsequently worked a considerable time on larger support and development teams, and interact well with people at all levels. 
Recently I have studied NLP and ML, with particular interest in developments in the field of Machine Translation. My background in languages, translation in particular, have given me insights into current developments. </p>

<p>“In its communicative function, language is a set of tools with which we attempt to guide another mind to create within itself a mental representation that approximates the one we have.” Scott Delancey</p>
