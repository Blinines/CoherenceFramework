		<seg id="0">Another Balkan High Noon</seg>
		<seg id="1">With the world focused on Iraq, North Korea, and a possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons, Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen.</seg>
		<seg id="2">That inattention will end soon; a decision about the province's fate is looming.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before the end of the year on whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This decision -- crucial to the future of an unstable region -- will test Western determination and unity.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Negotiations this year in Vienna, brokered by the United Nations, showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on &quot;final status&quot; will not happen.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Talks continue, but, as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council, they are effectively dead.</seg>
		<seg id="7">No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo's independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Indeed, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the apostle of Serbian nationalism, has been trying in every way to undermine Kosovo's interim government.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a new constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public education.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The main purpose of his new constitution is its preamble, which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part of Serbia.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia, no matter how tenuous.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Throughout the 1990's, they virtually opted out of Serbian-run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO's subsequent intervention, which ended Serbia's rule and established a quasi-state under UN administration, has made anything other than independence intolerable.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Some time over the next month or two, the Balkan Contact Group — the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia -- will consider Ahtisaari's recommendations on Kosovo's final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council, which must make the final decision.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In public, all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo's final status open, but informally the US and some of its allies have told the two parties that they will propose independence this year.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some members of the Security Council -- particularly Russia and China -- are opposed to or skeptical of an imposed settlement, and few governments favor dividing up another country's territory, however compelling the circumstances.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto, which will require considerable diplomatic effort.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The nature of the independence bestowed is also important.</seg>
		<seg id="19">An independent Kosovo must be secured and its minorities protected.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Northern Kosovo, now largely under Belgrade's control, must not be partitioned off in all but name.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In the interest of reducing the blow to Serbia, the Security Council must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function.</seg>
		<seg id="22">If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status, it will produce a GRAVE situation: Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally, and all nations would have to make up their mind whether or not to recognize the new state.</seg>
		<seg id="23">If that happens, it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare their own independence.</seg>
		<seg id="24">At a minimum, Serbia would campaign strongly against recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In fact, Serbia's government is already trying to persuade the West to postpone a decision until mid-2007.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence, the ultranationalist Radical Party will come to power in the next elections, and believes that holding elections as early as this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Moreover, the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia's Republika Srpska to threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And they continue to push  unsuccessfully for Ahtisaari's removal in order to prolong the Vienna talks.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of this delaying strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Some hope that postponement will stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">That tactic may be working.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Many European Union countries are worried about the implications of taking away a country's territory, as well as the impact of Kosovo's independence on Serbian democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Given Serbia's political instability, they question the harm of a short-term postponement -- albeit mostly self-inflicted.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The West must ignore Belgrade's siren song.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Serbian politics will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable future, and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Likewise, there will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But failure to proceed definitively now on Kosovo's final status will produce a worse Balkan situation, one that blocks Serbia's move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU, condemns Kosovo's ethnic minorities to dangerous ambiguity, and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia.</seg>
		<seg id="39">No realistic solution exists for Kosovo but independence.</seg>
		<seg id="40">If Serbia wants to join the West, it must not forsake that opportunity by trapping itself in its nationalist past.</seg>

		<seg id="0">South Korea's Dangerous New Dawn</seg>
		<seg id="1">North Korea's decision to expel UN atomic energy inspectors is but another reason to view Roh Moo Hyun's election as South Korea's president two weeks ago as an historical watershed.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The beginning of his term not only coincides with one of the most dangerous episodes on the Korean peninsula in decades, but his presidency will also test South Korea's relations with the US to a degree that has not been seen for many years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Roh's victory over Lee Hoi Chang signifies a generational shift in Korean politics, with the young determined to gain a freer hand in Korea's relations with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, generational differences were the deciding factor in the race, replacing the regional sentiments that dominated every presidential race before this one.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to one report, over 60% of people in their twenties and thirties voted for Roh to produce a margin of 2.3% in this first two-man, head-to-head presidential race in 31 years.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Roh's populist and nationalist stance will be swiftly and sorely tested by reality when he assumes power in February.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But couple the generational changeover thaty put him in office with a strong popular desire for continued engagement with North Korea--notwithstanding North Korea's growing nuclear brinkmanship--and the recipe is complete for disputes with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Roh, a self-made man who passed a bar examination without going to college and law school, succeeded in convincing voters that he would usher in a new brand of politics reflecting South Korea's growing wealth and middle class sentiments, thereby sweeping away insider-dominated politics, regional bickering, and factional struggles.</seg>
		<seg id="9">His style and rhetoric projected the fresh (for Korea!) image of a common man committed to eliminating the ossified networks of cronyism and corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For the first time in modern Korean history, the presidential campaign actually debated the central issues facing the country, rather than focussing on parties and personalities.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Candidate Roh called for a new relationship between South Korea and the US, one based on the principle of independence and equality.</seg>
		<seg id="12">For example, he said that he would not kow-tow to the US or visit Washington just for the sake of a photo opportunity He also promised to continue President Kim Dae Jung's &quot;Sunshine policy&quot; of engagement with the North.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Remarkably, Roh won the election despite North Korea's decision to reactivate nuclear reactors that had been frozen since 1994.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A few years ago this would have doomed Roh's candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="15">That he overcame this obstacle without changing his stance on engaging North Korea means that times have radically changed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A popular yearning for change, not the security situation, is now the overriding concern of ordinary Koreans.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Roh's campaign also took advantage of a rising tide of anti-Americanism.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The acquittal by a US military court of two American soldiers who accidentally killed two Korean schoolgirls with their armored car last June triggered street demonstrations across the country.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Although President George W. Bush apologized twice for the deaths of the girls, demands continue to escalate for changing the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) that governs the legal treatment of American troops stationed in South Korea.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ordinary Koreans insist that US soldiers who commit crimes should be tried in Korean courts.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This expression of wounded national pride was enabled by South Korea's tremendous performance in the World Cup football tournament last summer, which helped convince ordinary Koreans that their country was fully grown up--and thus might be able to stand on its own without the presence of 37,000 US troops.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Indeed, many ordinary people now view the US presence, and not North Korea's communist regime, as the biggest obstacle to unification.</seg>
		<seg id="23">According to a recent poll, only 54.8% of Koreans now support the stationing of American troops in the country, while 31.7% oppose it.</seg>
		<seg id="24">These sentiments will form part of the diplomatic test shaping Roh's presidency from the start, for he must re-engineer relations with America at the same time that the Bush administration is fretting about North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its role in spreading weapons of mass destruction to rogue states.</seg>
		<seg id="25">For now, Korean voters--apparently impervious to the threat that North Korea's nuclear weapons poses--support Roh's policy of maintaining dialogue and economic exchange with the North.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Under President Roh, South Korea's domestic politics and relations with the US and North Korea will require an almost total overhaul.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Can he walk the tightrope of maintaining security on the peninsula, keeping America engaged, and retaining the support of the voters who elected him?</seg>
		<seg id="28">Reconciling those goals would test even the most experienced and cynical of politicians, so it is anyone's guess as to whether President Roh can succeed.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Failure, however, offers such a horrific prospect that no one can possibly hope for it.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Unilateral Road to Peace</seg>
		<seg id="1">In the next three weeks, the Israeli army will do something unprecedented: instead of defending the country against external enemies or terrorism, it will evacuate -- by force if necessary -- 9,000 Israelis from their homes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Israel's unilateral withdrawal is the outcome of a deep political shift that has been caused by two somewhat contradictory convictions that have characterized Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's policies since 2003: first, that the US-initiated &quot;road map&quot; is going nowhere and, second, that the status quo is untenable.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Certainly, according to Sharon's thinking, there is no future for 9,000 Jewish settlers living among 1.2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hence, in the absence of negotiations, a unilateral withdrawal is the only meaningful step towards de-escalation and stabilization.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This policy has deeply divided Israel: the settlers -- mostly, but not exclusively religious -- feel betrayed by Sharon, &quot;The Father of the Settlements.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">It is now the Israeli left that, however reluctantly, realizes that Sharon's new pragmatism may be the first step in the right direction.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Like de Gaulle in Algeria, Sharon has reshuffled the cards of Israel's politics.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The last weeks have seen massive demonstrations, some of them verging on violence; many of the settlers have declared that they will not obey government orders to evacuate.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This forcible approach is traumatic not only for the settlers, but also for many other Israelis.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Only the next days and weeks will tell whether the evacuation proceeds peacefully or not.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the meantime, Sharon has paid heavily for his policies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Two right-wing parties have left his ruling coalition, he has lost his majority within his own Likud Party, and his finance minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has quit his government.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Only by bringing Shimon Peres's Labor Party into his cabinet did Sharon manage to retain his parliamentary majority.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The question, of course, is what will happen after the Gaza disengagement.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Many governments were initially skeptical about disengagement, but realized that -- as the Washington saying goes -- &quot;this is the only game in town.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Among them, as well as among the Palestinians, one hears the hope that after the Gaza withdrawal, it will be possible to return to the road map and to resume negotiations leading to a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is a major mistake.</seg>
		<seg id="19">While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Future negotiations will have to deal with the ultimate borders between Israel and Palestine, the fate of 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and with the problem of the 1947-48 Palestinian refugees.</seg>
		<seg id="21">On all of these issues, the gulf between the Israeli and Palestinian positions has not narrowed since the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000, while fear and distrust have increased.</seg>
		<seg id="22">To attempt negotiations under these circumstances would not only be an exercise in futility, but may merely deepen alienation and suspicion on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The failure of the Annan Plan for Cyprus suggests that good intentions are not enough -- and the disagreements in Cyprus were miniscule compared to what divides Israelis and Palestinians.</seg>
		<seg id="24">So what can be done?</seg>
		<seg id="25">Probably the only rational way to proceed would be to acknowledge that unilateral steps on both sides can still further the cause of de-escalation and ultimate reconciliation.</seg>
		<seg id="26">On the Israeli side, further disengagement from dozens of isolated and small settlements on the West Bank, entailing the evacuation of between 20,000 and 30,000 settlers, may be politically feasible and would give the Palestinians a contiguous territory on the West Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On the Palestinian side, consolidation of the Palestinian Authority's control over a dozen security services and militias would be an important step.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The Palestinian leader, Abu Mazen, recognizes this, but the question is whether he can deliver.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The Palestinian leadership could also start down the difficult road of telling the refugees that -- contrary to almost 50 years of Palestinian propaganda -- they will not return to Israel, but will have to be settled in the West Bank and Gaza, the areas that will become part of the eventual Palestinian state.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But in the real world -- and Cyprus, Bosnia, and Kosovo may be examples -- stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In the absence of plausible alternatives, one hopes that this will also be the case for Israelis and Palestinians.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A World Restored?</seg>
		<seg id="1">BERLIN: Like old battle horses feeling young as the bugle sounds, Cold War strategists are feeling the adrenalin mount as missile defense becomes front page news.</seg>
		<seg id="2">True, the defense against missiles which Bill Clinton (reluctantly) and George W. Bush (enthusiastically) are proposing -- with massive support from America's Congress -- is different from Ronald Reagan's Star Wars dream of twenty years ago: NMD is supposed to catch only a modest number of warheads, not provide complete protection against enemy missiles.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nevertheless, the issue rekindles old debates over deterrence, mutual assured destruction and nuclear arms control, and revives the rivalry between the nuclear powers just when nuclear weapons had lost much of their relevance.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Amazingly, debate is heating up even though it is uncertain that NMD will work.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Even if it does work, it will be ten to fifteen years, possibly longer, before NMD is operational.</seg>
		<seg id="6">So tempers are rising over something which, if and when it happens in the distant future, may or may not have much impact.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Normally cautious governments are positioning themselves now as if the future were around the corner.</seg>
		<seg id="8">What explains this odd behavior?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Not blind faith in technology.</seg>
		<seg id="10">After all, the history of missile defense is a tale of technology constantly disappointing its advocates in and out of government.</seg>
		<seg id="11">No one in his right mind can assume that something never achieved before, namely destroying a small number of warheads in flight, will happen over night.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Of the three tests so far conducted, one failed almost, two entirely, which is why President Clinton left the matter to his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If President Bush, as he has hinted, now favors a different design, it will take even more time to develop the architecture and devise a test program.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Nobody can be sure that it will work either.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Governments are worried now, not because of capabilities, but because of America's real or imagined intentions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">While Americans claim that NMD is not directed against anyone, that all the US wants is to protect its citizens against states like Iraq or North Korea, almost everyone else thinks differently: Russians fear that America wants to cement its military superiority (and Russia's inferiority) forever; the Chinese are concerned that NMD signals American readiness to help Taiwan remain independent; Europeans worry that America's plans invite tensions with Russia and may separate the US from Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Because political intentions, not technical capabilities matter, NMD creates problems now: it pushes Russia into confrontation, heightens Chinese nervousness, and underpins a European sense of estrangement from the US.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Damage is done from the word go while the end of the road remains obscured.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Inflating this political damage is the fact that, thirty years ago, the US and the then Soviet Union renounced effective defense against strategic nuclear missiles.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Normally, a US defense project in its infancy would not cause the excitement NMD generates.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But the 1972 ABM Treaty prohibits, for the indefinite future, systems to protect either country against such nuclear attack.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As the US proceeds with NMD, it will either have to violate the Treaty or give six months notice to quit, something both signatories are entitled to do if they feel their vital security interests demand it.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the eyes of many, that would amount to America opting out of the structure of nuclear arms control built in the latter part of the Cold War.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Bush Administration argues that, because the Cold War is over, the formal disappearance of the ABM Treaty would not mean a loss of nuclear stability.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But stability is as much a matter of political perceptions as of technical calculations.</seg>
		<seg id="26">By limiting strategic missile defense, the old treaty provides a certain predictability of deterrence for all nuclear weapon states.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Its disappearance would affect all other arms control agreements.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Russia threatens to scrap all of them once the US leaves the ABM-Treaty.</seg>
		<seg id="29">While this threat lacks credibility (it would harm Russian interests most) it has a certain logic.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The main question NMD poses is not how to prepare for a future world of missile defense but how to dampen today's political concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Such efforts are getting discretely underway.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Legal experts in Washington suggest that modest preparations for building missile and radar sites do not violate the ABM-Treaty and so do not yet require a US notice to quit.</seg>
		<seg id="33">For now, the Bush Administration will await the outcome of tests before deciding.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Both Moscow and Washington hint at possible deep cuts in their offensive nuclear arsenals.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Skeptical European allies are being mollified by US assurances of close consultation.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The most important of confidence-building measures, a modification of the ABM-Treaty to allow for limited missile defense, is being explored.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Russia's early &quot;nyet&quot; may not be the last word.</seg>
		<seg id="38">So political turmoil with Russia and Europe might be calmed.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But what about China?</seg>
		<seg id="40">In contrast to Europe and Russia, China is not party to an alliance (as is Europe) or to a network of arms control treaties through which political solutions can evolve (like Russia), factors that contribute to Asian instabilities and Chinese sensitivity.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Here confidence can only be built through the approach taken by the US to China.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Regrettably, there are no indications yet that the problem is recognized in Washington as a serious one.</seg>
		<seg id="43">All this comes as a disappointment to old Cold War strategists.</seg>
		<seg id="44">While brushing up the vocabulary and abbreviations of the age of superpower deterrence, they discover that such a world has gone.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Missile defense is not a threat to US-Russian strategic stability; its mishandling is a threat to political predictability.</seg>
		<seg id="46">By announcing its determination to go ahead with a distant NMD, the US has created political turbulence which it must address now if major damage is to be avoided.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The New Baby Boomers</seg>
		<seg id="1">Alienated and unemployed youth are a concern everywhere.</seg>
		<seg id="2">They pose a particular challenge in the developing world, where a demographic bulge equal to the great &quot;baby boom&quot; that occurred in the West at the end of World War II is growing.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But the post-war era in the world's most developed countries was one of unprecedented prosperity for the baby boom generation, which is now nearing retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Will the future be as promising for the developing world's billion-plus young people between the ages of 12 and 24?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Throughout the developing world, governments urgently need to devise the right mix of investments and policies to encourage their young people to get an education, find work, stay healthy, form families, and exercise citizenship.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The payoff is huge if they get it right: accelerated development as economies reap the benefits of a burgeoning working-age population and lower dependency ratios.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In East Asia, this &quot;demographic dividend&quot; is believed to have generated more than a quarter of the region's economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Developing countries have already invested heavily in children.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Their young people are therefore better-educated and healthier than previous generations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">More than 80% of children now attend primary school, up from 50% in 1970, and infant mortality has fallen from more than 10% to 6.5% over the same period.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But now governments must go beyond investments in children and begin supporting the new generation of young people.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Indeed, even in countries with high primary-school completion rates, many young people do not attend secondary school.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Young people account for half of all new HIV infections.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And, in the Middle East and North Africa region, about a quarter of all young people are unemployed.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These problems raise thorny questions: What prevents more young people from attending secondary school?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Is it because they are sometimes close to being illiterate even after primary school, or because it is unaffordable?</seg>
		<seg id="17">Why don't more young people learn how to lower the risk of getting HIV/AIDS?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Why do businesses in these countries complain of a lack of skilled workers when so many university students are jobless?</seg>
		<seg id="19">To build successful youth-friendly policies, governments need to focus on three policy areas: expanding opportunities, enhancing capabilities, and providing second chances for young people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Governments must broaden opportunities for young people by improving access to, and the quality of, health and educational services.</seg>
		<seg id="21">We know that the full benefit of primary school is realized only when children go on to secondary school.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Yet many young people are ill prepared for secondary school, and places are scarce.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Today's employers want highly skilled workers.</seg>
		<seg id="24">More than 20% of all firms, in countries as diverse as Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, and Zambia, rate inadequate skills and education of workers as a major or a severe obstacle.</seg>
		<seg id="25">If young people are not to become stuck in dead-end jobs, or end up without jobs at all, they need better education and skills that match those needed by employers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Several countries now facilitate access to secondary schooling, in particular through &quot;conditional cash transfer programs,&quot; which offer a stipend to poor families whose children regularly attend school.</seg>
		<seg id="27">These programs have successfully increased secondary school enrollment in countries like Mexico, Ecuador, Bangladesh, and Cambodia.</seg>
		<seg id="28">For these programs to work, however, children must be ready to enter secondary education.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Yet, in Morocco, for example, more than 80% of school children complete primary school, but fewer than 20% have mastered the material.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Second, policies should support young people as they strive to make good decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Governments cannot substitute for parents or for communities, but they can encourage young people and their families to invest in themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Armed with the right information and incentives, young people can make better decisions about their health and education.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In Cameroon, Horizon Jeunes, a reproductive health program that targets urban youth, increased young people's knowledge of reproductive health and successfully changed their behavior, with condom use among females increasing from 58% to 76% in the treatment group.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Similarly, the rate at which eighth graders from the Dominican Republic entered upper secondary levels increased when they were simply told how much more those who finished high school earned -- an amount they had vastly underestimated.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Bangladesh's Female Secondary Stipend Program was successful in helping girls aged 11 to 14 to delay marriage and remain in school.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Governments must also begin to offer &quot;second chances&quot; for young people who have fallen behind due to difficult circumstances or poor choices.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Such programs must be well designed, targeted, and coordinated to give the right incentives to beneficiaries.</seg>
		<seg id="38">For example, sub-Saharan Africa has thousands of young combatants -- 100,000 in Sudan alone -- who hope to reconstruct their lives in peacetime but clearly require skills training and jobs, as well as medical and psychological support.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Focusing political will and the efforts of young people themselves to expand opportunities, enhance capabilities, and provide second chances can help countries make the most of today's demographic advantage.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Countries can either harness this growth -- and in so doing, transform their development prospects -- or face the risk of an alienated generation embittered by the unfulfilled chance of a better future.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Down with Euro-Paternalism</seg>
		<seg id="1">Italy's presidency of the European Union bears an enormous responsibility, namely reinvigorating enlargement as the key aspect of the new EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A good place to start would be to push for a different attitude on accession countries' adoption of the Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, EU institutions' current paternalistic stance towards the accession countries threatens to create a two-tier Europe that will complicate the task of integration.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The accession countries have upheld their end of the bargain, achieving a degree of trade integration with EU countries that is even higher than many current members.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Three of them--Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania--have currency boards or a fixed exchange rate with the Euro, as does Bulgaria, which is expected to enter the EU in 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The others have declared for several years their interest in adopting the Euro early on, in some cases unilaterally, even before entry into the EU--a position openly supported by the National Bank of Poland, and less forcefully by the National Bank of Hungary and the Czech National Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But, despite their progress in bringing their inflation and interest rates closer to EU levels, many candidate countries fear that with the full opening up to capital flows--a requirement of accession--they will be exposed to the risk of sudden stops in capital flows and currency crises.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have learned the lesson from Latin America and Asia in the 1990's.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Adopting the Euro would give them a great way to escape such risks and focus on creating real growth in their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But the response from EU institutions, namely the European Central Bank and the European Commission, has been negative: candidate countries were told that they first must spend at least two years in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), where Euro aspirants are expected to prove their policy mettle.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Initially, even currency boards were considered unacceptable, although, as is often the case in Europe, exceptions were made: countries with currency boards could keep them after entry into the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The opposition of the ECB and the Commission to rapid Euro adoption lacks strong foundations.</seg>
		<seg id="13">What should matter for the EU is that the policies of any member state are not harmful to other members.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As Leszek Balcerowicz, the Governor of the National Bank of Poland, argues, adoption of the Euro by candidate countries will certainly create benefits for candidate countries, while in the worst case being neutral for current members.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Indeed, the combined size of the candidate countries' economies is so small--around 6% of the enlarged EU's GDP--that they cannot possibly exert any significant effect on the Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But continuing opposition by EU institutions has led most candidate countries to abandon the idea of adopting the Euro unilaterally or as quickly as possible after entering the Union.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Unfortunately, the stubbornness of the ECB and the European Commission is now providing ammunition to populist governments in accession countries that are counting on currency appreciation to escape the fiscal discipline that adopting the Euro would imply.</seg>
		<seg id="18">However, such fiscal expansion would probably disqualify a country from entering the Euro any time soon.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Indeed, the accession countries that have not implemented a currency board have seen their budget deficits surge--exceeding 9% of GDP in Hungary in 2002 and more than 5% in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia--while large capital inflows have kept their currencies under strong pressure to appreciate.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This trend exposes candidate countries' real economies to precisely the risk of a capital flow reversal and currency crisis that early Euro adoption was meant to eliminate.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is ironic that the candidate countries are being lectured to by officials at the ECB and the European Commission on the trade-off between nominal and real convergence.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The objective of growth for the accession countries is apparently the sole imperative in Brussels; macroeconomic stability can wait.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Large budget deficits support growth, but inflation evidently is not a problem.</seg>
		<seg id="24">If this line of thought sounds familiar, perhaps it is because it (more or less) recapitulates the foundations of the unsustainable planning system with which the accession countries broke at the beginning of the 1990's.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It was, of course, the embrace of rational, market-driven economic policies by the former communist nations that has brought them to the brink of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="26">So European institutions should abandon their paternalistic approach and take seriously the concerns of accession countries' central bankers about the risks of maintaining their own currencies for a long period during which their economies have to open up completely to capital flows.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As it is, the ECB and the European Commission are de facto supporting the positions of populist governments in Eastern Europe that are already spending the funds they hope to get in the future from the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is high time that EU institutions address more seriously the challenges and opportunities posed by enlargement.</seg>
		<seg id="29">They can begin by viewing accession countries' early adoption of the Euro more favorably, both for countries with a currency board and for those with floating exchange rates.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Blair's EU disaster</seg>
		<seg id="1">When voters in France and the Netherlands turned down the proposal for a Constitution for the European Union, the world knew that the European project was in deep trouble.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Last week's bruising battle over the medium-term future of the Union's budget has confirmed that verdict with a vengeance.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It also brought to a sorry close the UK's six-month presidency of the European Council, confirming Britain's long-standing reputation as the odd-man-out in the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The two events are intimately connected.</seg>
		<seg id="5">French and Dutch voters did not say why they voted against the planned Constitution.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But many commentators believe that they were protesting against what they perceived as the precipitate admission of ten new member states, mainly much poorer countries from Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In particular, voters were afraid that their jobs would be lost to hordes of Eastern immigrants, exemplified in the image widely quoted at the time, of the low-cost Polish plumber.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The irony, of course, was that most of the 15 old member states had refused to give the new members full and immediate access to the Western job markets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But in any event, it was too late to protest: the ten Eastern states had already been granted membership of the Union.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But now the 25 member states must deal with the financial consequences of that enlargement, not just in the overall size of the European Union budget for the next seven years, but in who pays and who benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In particular, the central issue is how far the old member states are willing to pay to boost the less developed economies of the new members.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the event, it turned into a three-way battle between Britain, France and the new member states.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Traditionally, a large majority of the budget has gone either on agriculture or on the development of backward regions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In practice, this has meant large flows of money either to big agricultural producers, like France, or to poorer member states, like Greece and Portugal.</seg>
		<seg id="15">On both counts, the new member states expected to benefit substantially from the EU system.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the past, the big loser from the EU system, in budgetary terms, was the UK; for while agriculture accounted for two thirds of all EU spending, the UK had a small farm sector, and therefore received small farm payments.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The British long complained of the unfairness of these rules, especially in view of the fact that the UK was one of the relatively poorer member states; and in 1984, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government demanded, and got, a massive rebate on its net contribution to the EU budget.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Today, the situation has changed in three important respects.</seg>
		<seg id="19">EU farm policy has started to be reformed, and its share of the EU budget has fallen from over 60% to 40%; Britain has for several years enjoyed significantly faster economic growth than most other member states, so that it is now one of the richer EU countries, even compared with France and Germany; and the new member states are so much poorer than even the poorest of the old members, that they have an unanswerable moral case for a generous share of whatever budget could be negotiated.</seg>
		<seg id="20">When negotiations started six months ago, it was Britain's turn to take over the Presidency of the European Council.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Tony Blair, British Prime Minister, electrified the world of European politics by telling the European Parliament that he was a &quot;passionate pro-European&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This was a message for which Britain's European friends had long been hoping, and for which they had waited in vain since Blair's election in 1997.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Certainly, he had never expressed any such sentiment inside the British Isles during the previous eight years.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Since Britain had been one of the most insistent advocates of enlargement of the EU to the candidates from Central and Eastern Europe, one might have expected that the Blair government would have wished to be correspondingly generous to the new-comers in the conduct of the budgetary negotiations.</seg>
		<seg id="25">At first, this seemed to be the British government's chosen tactic.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Against all expectations, it struck a morally advantageous posture by offering to surrender some part of its budget rebate, but only if the rest of the European Union (i.e. France, in particular) would agree to fundamental reforms of EU farm policy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It took some time before the British came to understand that since President Jacques Chirac is a beleaguered lame-duck President, who will remain in office but not in power until 2007, he is in no position to agree to any such bargain.</seg>
		<seg id="28">So when the British came to terms with this harsh reality, they played out the lamentable end-game of their management of the negotiations with small-minded cheese-paring and logic-chopping offers, all designed primarily to safeguard narrow British interests, mainly at the expense of the new member states.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It is a sad conclusion to a presidency, launched six-months ago, with Blair's claim that he was a &quot;passionate pro-European&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Yet the full text of his speech tells it all.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Blair is in favour of Europe; but not this Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="32">He wants to be a part of a political Europe; but only if the other member states follow Britain's model of economic and social reform.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The problem is that economic and social reform are purely national responsibilities, and do not lie within the competence of the Union; if there is to be economic and social reform in France and Germany, that is a matter exclusively for French and German voters and politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It could only be a European matter, if the EU were a real federation.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Is Blair a federalist, then?</seg>
		<seg id="36">Heavens, no!</seg>
		<seg id="37">He is merely an unthinking nationalist, living in terror of the nationalist yellow tabloid press.</seg>
		<seg id="38">So why does he say he is a passionate pro-European?</seg>
		<seg id="39">Because he has not thought about the question for one moment.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's Neo-Liberal Challenge</seg>
		<seg id="1">For over 20 years I have argued that Western Europe's high unemployment rates are unsustainable.</seg>
		<seg id="2">At the end of the 1970's, monetarists bet that only a transitory and modest increase in unemployment could rein in the creeping -- and trotting -- inflation of the industrial west, and that in retrospect the cost of returning to effective price stability would be judged worthwhile.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In Britain and the United States, this monetarist bet turned out well.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In Western Europe, it did not.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Over the past 25 years in Europe, unemployment rose as monetary policy was tightened and interest rates were raised to fight inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But after inflation succumbed, unemployment did not fall -- or not by much.</seg>
		<seg id="7">If unemployment was not stuck quite at Great Depression levels, it remained high enough to make long-term joblessness or the fear of long-term joblessness a defining experience.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Societies in which the official unemployment rate stands at 10% or more for generations are societies in which government economic management has failed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">So, for 20 years it has seemed to me that Western Europe's underlying political equilibrium -- corporatist bargaining and ample social insurance, on the one hand, and tight monetary policies, on the other -- must crack.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Twin fears appear to be paralyzing European policymakers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Europe's central bankers fear that their political masters will order them to loosen monetary policy, that the structural reforms needed to free up aggregate supply will not be forthcoming, and that the result will be a return to the inflation of the 1970's.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In short, they fear that all of the sacrifices made for price stability will have been in vain.</seg>
		<seg id="13">West European politicians, for their part, fear the opposite outcome.</seg>
		<seg id="14">They worry that even after undertaking structural reforms to reduce the attractiveness of unemployment benefits and increase the ability of workers to move to jobs and of firms to move to workers, central bankers will continue to insist on tight money.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In short, they fear that, with no expansion of output or employment, the net effect will simply be an increase in poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Of course, these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, boosting employment and output without raising inflation by much.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the reality is that steps toward looser monetary policies are non-existent -- especially with the fledgling European Central Bank anxious to establish its inflation-fighting credibility -- and that steps toward structural reforms are half-hearted, hesitant, and small.</seg>
		<seg id="18">For 20 years, I have been wrong: West European polities have remained stable despite the exclusion of a large proportion of citizens from meaningful participation in much of economic life.</seg>
		<seg id="19">West European economies have continued to grow -- albeit not as rapidly as they might have -- despite bearing the heavy burden of the unemployed 10% or more of the labor force.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Now, though, it looks like I may finally be right -- or at least right to worry, if not to panic.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The French rejected the European Union constitution, primarily -- or so it appears -- because further European integration, it is feared, must bring in its wake the huge costs and disruptions of neo-liberalism.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is one thing to back the &quot;European project&quot; when the idea is to bind Germany so tightly to France that never again will anybody think it worthwhile to wage a war over what language is spoken in Alsace-Lorraine.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is another when the European project means that French workers face competition from Polish plumbers, Romanian farmers, and Turkish shop clerks.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In Germany, the electorate seems poised to eject Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder out of discontent with his tepid allegiance to the neo-liberal project.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The problem is that the electorate will then get four years of rule by a chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose commitment to the neo-liberal project is almost as strong as mine.</seg>
		<seg id="26">I think that Germany would be better off in a decade under more neo-liberal policies.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But this does not seem to be what the German electorate wants, and this makes the complexion of German politics four years from now incalculable.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Coupled with all this is northern European discontent with the central bankers, specifically with the ECB and the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It is not that the end of European Monetary Union is on the agenda; it is merely that people have begun thinking about possible low-probability futures in which the end of EMU might be placed on the agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="30">That is enough to shake asset prices worldwide.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Western Europe's accomplishments since World War II are among the most heartening and impressive success stories in world history.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Everyone should want today's undivided Europe to build on these accomplishments, rather than for generations of high unemployment to jeopardize them.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But this will require a shift in the ECB's attitude.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Europe needs a monetary policy that views aiding employment growth in northern Europe as more important than continental price stability.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There will, after all be inflation in southern and eastern Europe -- there must be, for as regions develop and industrialize their terms of trade must improve, and under a monetary union regional inflation is how this can happen.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The ECB should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation in the north in order to hit artificial continent-wide targets.</seg>

		<seg id="1">What do we owe to our great-great-great-grandchildren?</seg>
		<seg id="2">What actions are we obligated to take now in order to diminish the risks to our descendants and our planet from the increasing likelihood of global warming and climate change?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Almost everyone -- except the likes of ExxonMobil, US Vice President Dick Cheney, and their paid servants and deluded acolytes -- understands that when humans burn hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere, where it acts like a giant blanket, absorbing infrared radiation coming up from below and warming the earth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Likewise, almost everyone understands that while global warming might be a much smaller or larger problem than existing models suggest, this uncertainty is no excuse for inaction.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In fact, uncertainty about global climate change should lead us to do more to guard against it than if we knew it would proceed exactly according to the central-case projections.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Finally, almost everyone agrees that governments, non-profit institutions, and energy companies should be spending far more to develop technologies that generate non-carbon-emitting power, that remove it from the atmosphere to forests or oceans, and that cool the earth by reflecting more of the sunlight that lands on it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Clearly, the world's rich countries should carry the burden of dealing with climate change over the next generations.</seg>
		<seg id="8">After all, they could take an easy, emissions-intensive path to industrialization and wealth.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today, China, India, and other developing countries cannot, and it would be unfair to penalize them for that.</seg>
		<seg id="10">So now is the time to build, not disrupt or impede, the international institutions that will manage our response to global climate change in the years ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But should we be doing anything else now and in the next decade?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Economists like to think of things in terms of prices.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And when economists see behavior that has destructive side effects, we like to tax it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Taxation makes individuals feel in their wallets the destruction they are causing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Imposing a tax on those who, say, drive low-mileage SUV's is a way of harnessing humanity's collective intelligence to decide when bad side effects are a reason to alter behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But it has to be the right tax.</seg>
		<seg id="17">An SUV going ten miles in the city and burning a gallon of gasoline pumps about three kilograms of carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Should the extra &quot;global warming&quot; tax be $0.05 a gallon, $0.50 a gallon, or $1.50 a gallon?</seg>
		<seg id="19">Our views will change as we learn more, but at the moment the size of the tax hinges on a question of moral philosophy: how much do we believe we owe our distant descendents?</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Australian economist John Quiggin has an illuminating discussion on his website (</seg>
		<seg id="21">On the other hand, critics point out that the world today is poor: average annual GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is roughly $7,000.</seg>
		<seg id="22">We expect improved technology and its spread to make the world of 2100, at a 2% annual growth rate, much richer: $50,000 per capita of year-2006 purchasing power.</seg>
		<seg id="23">So the critics argue that we need the marginal $70 per capita today much more than the richer people of 2100 will need the $500 that they would gain from being spared the effects of global climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But what the critics often don't say is that the same logic applies to the world today.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Average annual per capita incomes in the US, Japan, and Western Europe are currently around $40,000, and less than $6,000 for the poorer half of the world's population.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The same logic that says we need our $70 more than the people of 2100 need an extra $500 dictates that we should tax the world's rich more, as long as each extra $500 in first-world taxes generates as little as an extra $70 in poor countries per capita incomes.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In short, if the world's rich are stingy today toward our much richer descendants, and if we want to leave our environmental mess to them to deal with, we should be lavish toward the world's poor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Likewise, if we are stingy today toward the world's poor, we should be lavish toward our descendents.</seg>
		<seg id="29">At least, that is what we should do, if our actions are based on some moral principle, rather than that of Leonid Brezhnev: what we have, we hold.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Taking Drug Safety Seriously</seg>
		<seg id="1">Health hazards -- nuclear reactors, guns, and contaminated foods -- surround all of us, so governments take an active role in limiting these hazards through regulations, which, in many cases, are very successful.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the situation is far different concerning the safety of prescription drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, as far as protecting the public is concerned, drug safety is the regulator's neglected stepchild.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The magnitude of the problem is huge.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In the United States alone, it is estimated that every year up to 100,000 patients die due to serious adverse drug reactions (ADR's).</seg>
		<seg id="6">If true, drug-induced death would qualify as the fourth or fifth leading cause of death (depending on which mortality estimates are used).</seg>
		<seg id="7">Moreover, the direct annual hospital costs attributable to ADR's run into the billions of dollars, and this does not include all the suffering that ADR's cause that does not lead to hospitalization (or death).</seg>
		<seg id="8">The difficulties in determining cause and effect must be acknowledged.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Whether a patient's death or hospitalization is due to a particular drug, the underlying illness, or a combination of the two can be hard to determine.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But this makes drug safety all the more important.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Inherent to drug safety is the fact that all drugs, in addition to their benefits, cause harm in certain patients.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Drug approval and use requires a careful weighing of desirable and undesirable effects.</seg>
		<seg id="13">These judgments vary, depending on whether they are made by a drug company, which stands to benefit from sales, or a patient at risk of suffering a serious adverse effect.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Incomplete knowledge complicates this assessment.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The rush to get new drugs to market often leads to inadequate safety documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="16">More than half of all approved drugs produce a serious adverse reaction that is not known at the time of regulatory approval.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For example, when the new class of painkillers called Cox-2 inhibitors was introduced, regulators, physicians, and patients were unaware that these drugs could cause heart attacks and strokes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Tens of thousands of innocent patients -- perhaps more -- suffered such ADR's before the first two drugs of this class were withdrawn.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Proper and complete documentation of harmful drug effects is difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spontaneous reporting rates to regulatory agencies are low -- approximately 1% -- and ongoing monitoring is passive in many countries.</seg>
		<seg id="21">There is also a general reluctance to report unfavorable drug effects.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Physicians may feel guilty and fear litigation, drug companies worry about the threat to corporate profits and regulatory agencies must face the question: &quot;Why was the drug approved in the first place?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug if the medical event is common in the user's age group or in the condition being treated.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Because the risk of heart attacks is high in older people, many of whom have arthritic pain requiring treatment with painkillers, it took six years to link Cox-2 inhibitors to a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of heart attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="25">A recent Harris Survey in the US concluded that 60% of adults are either not confident at all or not very confident that drug makers will publicly and in a timely manner disclose data on their products' adverse effects.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Their skepticism is hardly groundless: internal documents obtained in recent lawsuits reveal that drug companies often fail to submit critical safety information to regulatory agencies, as required by law, and fail to communicate such information to physicians and patients.</seg>
		<seg id="27">One problem is that the consequences for neglecting drug safety are non-existing or minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The time has come to get serious:</seg>
		<seg id="29">· Citizens and government must make drug safety a priority and commit adequate resources to fixing the problems;</seg>
		<seg id="30">· Penalties for drug companies' failure to report and communicate safety information must be increased dramatically if they are to serve as effective deterrents;</seg>
		<seg id="31">· Regulatory agencies need enforcement authority so that stricter rules can be implemented;</seg>
		<seg id="32">· The drug-safety problem must be seen as a systemic failure.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It is unfair to blame clinicians for serious ADR's, particularly in the absence of complete safety information.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Fixing the problem requires full cooperation from clinicians, but this requires ending their fear of litigation.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This approach works well in the airline industry: pilots reporting near misses are not penalized;</seg>
		<seg id="36">· Patients need to be better informed about the risks of prescription drugs and more involved in detection and reporting.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Package inserts in fine print are useless;</seg>
		<seg id="38">· Monitoring of ADR's must be more pro-active.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This requires more funding, which should come from the main beneficiary of drug sales -- the pharmaceutical industry -- just as oversight of aviation safety is funded by the airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Above all, the success of any comprehensive effort to improve drug safety hinges upon establishing an independent office of drug safety to advocate, coordinate, and provide direction to the regulatory agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Such an office exists in the United Kingdom.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other governments should follow this model in order to fulfill their neglected role as guardian of public health.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Virtual Enemy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Five years have passed since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September, 2001, yet it seems that policymakers have learned little about how terrorist cells operate, and what their weaknesses are.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Bush administration still uses the phrase &quot;war on terror&quot; and behaves as though it really is a war, the ordinary kind where one government fights another.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It is time to understand the new, emerging model of conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In order to make the &quot;war&quot; paradigm fit, the Bush administration alludes to al-Qaeda as a centrally directed enemy.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In fact, there is now no master planner or funder of terrorist activities.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Madrid, London, and Bali attacks, as well as several thwarted operations in the United States and Britain, were all characterized by their dispersed organization.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Independently generated plots emerged and used ad hoc resources, often within the target country.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Those small operations also lacked a common internal design.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Terrorist motivations differ from cell to cell, even from person to person.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Individuals can be involved for profit and power, or for political and religious reasons, while others participate for hate or thrills.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, there are vast differences in terms of risks, rewards, and imperatives as one moves up the organizational chain, or jumps from cell to cell.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The characteristics of this new structure have already been studied in a very different context.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Terrorism is a violent version of an &quot;agile virtual enterprise.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">A virtual enterprise is any small group that self-assembles into an organization that is just large enough to accomplish the collective intention.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Virtual enterprises are unusually innovative, and, in the business sector, they are possibly the only system that can build a one-off product well.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A conspicuous example already exists in the movie production industry.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In fact, they are probably the commercial model of the future.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The benefits of virtual enterprises stem from their lightness over stability.</seg>
		<seg id="21">At present, most of the price of any product supports the huge, inefficient organization that assembled it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nearly all the creativity and problem solving occurs in small companies and is later &quot;integrated&quot; by mega-corporations, which have an expensive and vulnerable infrastructure, and keep most of the profit.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="24">When you buy a car from General Motors, 80 cents from each dollar goes to GM, which mostly only manages itself.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The small suppliers actually provide you with 80% of the value and innovation but only receive 20% of the reward.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Ironically, extensive research into alternative models was funded through the US Department of Defense, which, as the world's largest buyer of complex machinery, wanted better, cheaper and more tailored goods.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The research noted the conditions and triggers needed to facilitate the self-assembly of small opportunistic groups and enable them to act like large companies.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Unfortunately, the research program was cancelled before its findings could be applied in the business world, almost certainly because it threatened large companies.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It is often forgotten that US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emerged from a comfortable retirement to reorganize the American military into a smaller, more agile force, using some of these same insights.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But the planning for the Iraq invasion, in which Rumsfeld advocated the use of fewer troops than advised, suggests a poor understanding of distributed systems.</seg>
		<seg id="31">While the forces were deployed for a flexible entry and withdrawal, the Bush administration ended up using them for an old-fashioned occupation.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Terrorists have been better at capitalizing on models of distributed operation.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The best known in the West is The Management of Savagery , but only because it was translated and made public.</seg>
		<seg id="35">These books (and the trends they indicate) are becoming less dogmatic and increasingly sophisticated in the adoption of modern management techniques.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Their research surely includes the young science of virtual enterprise management: how to nurture and support self-organizing cells.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Perhaps the first lesson for Western policymakers is that virtual enterprises run on a culture of trust.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Some kinds of trust can be based on an artificial notion of &quot;not us&quot; rather than on real values and direct experience.</seg>
		<seg id="39">That is why the Bush administration's actions actually strengthen the virtual terrorist enterprise dynamic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Bush's &quot;us and them&quot; rhetoric clearly defines an &quot;other&quot; and positions it as a cohesive enemy.</seg>
		<seg id="41">His &quot;war&quot; approach is making it easier for Islamist terrorists to view the West as an equally united and malevolent force.</seg>
		<seg id="42">In the future, the virtual enterprise model will shape how business is conducted, wars will be fought and probably how government services will be administered.</seg>
		<seg id="43">It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="44">However, if Western governments do not develop a deep understanding of how these structures operate, they stand no chance of combating the agile terrorist enterprise.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Expansion is Solidarity</seg>
		<seg id="1">Nowadays it is often alleged that the European Union's sense of solidarity was put in jeopardy, if not shattered outright, by its enlargement to take in the countries of central and eastern Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As Bulgaria and Romania come closer to membership, and with accession talks with Turkey and Croatia set to begin, it has become increasingly important to challenge that view.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The values and interests of the EU's newest member states coincide in most ways with those of the 15 earlier members.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It is, of course, true that enlargement has fundamentally changed the Union and given rise to new problems and policy concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the new member states in central and eastern Europe are deeply embedded in the economic, social, and cultural development of our Continent.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The ties that bind us together were frayed by forty years of Soviet domination, but this did not fundamentally change these states' European character.</seg>
		<seg id="7">My country, Poland, has always had deep cultural ties to other European countries, especially France.</seg>
		<seg id="8">We participated in all the major developments in European music, literature, and film (think of Andrzej Wajda's films from the Solidarity era, such as &quot;Danton,&quot; which were French co-productions).</seg>
		<seg id="9">Even in sport, East Europeans have long been integrated with the rest of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Indeed, before World War I the German national football team consisted entirely of players with Polish names.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But, above all, there is a deep sense among Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and others, that they are Europeans.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This is the very meaning of the word &quot;solidarity,&quot; as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary: &quot;unity resulting from feelings and sympathies.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Solidarity, in the sense of unity resulting from common interests, also clearly exists within both the original EU-15 and the enlarged Union.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The exceptions prove the rule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The EU's disunity over the war in Iraq should not overshadow its member states' agreement on almost all other great questions of international affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In economic matters, disagreements on, say, a single EU regulation should not be allowed to mask the fact that no member state, new or old, has ever contested the internal market.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Finally, the enlargement process itself is also manifestly a symbol of European social, civic, and cultural unity.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The fact that it provoked debate and dispute does not detract from the conviction shared by old and new member states that they had an obligation to rebuild the Continent after 40 years of division.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But there are concerns that, if not fundamentally divisive, are worrying.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Should we fear the fact that Europe is no longer a purely Jewish/Christian and white continent?</seg>
		<seg id="21">Will EU citizens whose origins are in other continents and whose religion is Hindu or Islam, Sikh or Buddhist, be able to identify with &quot;European&quot; values and culture?</seg>
		<seg id="22">Will they be able to feel European, like the Poles or the Czechs have always felt?</seg>
		<seg id="23">These questions apply most pointedly -- indeed, they cannot be avoided -- in the case of Turkey's possible accession to the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Is European integration animated by respect for another's values?</seg>
		<seg id="25">Is it about sharing them or about contributing to them?</seg>
		<seg id="26">These are obviously knotty questions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">They are particularly difficult if we see culture as the cement of Europe's future.</seg>
		<seg id="28">All European countries probably believed at the outset that non-European newcomers could be assimilated in the same way that Polish immigrants were assimilated into Germany's Ruhr region in the nineteenth century.</seg>
		<seg id="29">That this has not happened, at least on a large scale, is not to say that it cannot happen at all.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Look at the growing number of prominent citizens of Turkish origin in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Consider the many second generation Indian and Pakistani Britons who are now seen in business suits carrying laptop computers and flying around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But Europeans must admit that these individuals represent a small minority.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Many immigrant groups in Europe find themselves flung back on their own communities by the impossibility of social and economic integration.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The constant threat of terrorism has made this isolation even more dramatic for the Europe's Islamic populations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The EU cannot simply proclaim &quot;solidarity&quot; as a core value and then do nothing to foster it among those who feel marginalized.</seg>
		<seg id="36">They, too, must be allowed to feel those ties of &quot;unity resulting from feelings and sympathy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="37">European solidarity cannot and will not survive their neglect.</seg>

		<seg id="0">After Kyoto</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations, including large emitters, in conversations about what to do after the treaty's expiration in 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be discussed by the European Council next March.</seg>
		<seg id="4">While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries -- 5.2% between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels, with varying targets for individual countries -- real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning, and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and transport.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In other words, we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security.</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the end of the day, the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system, an incentives system, and investments in technology change.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Increasingly, adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive, but complementary.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth's temperature, and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies -- a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Up to now, with only 15% of the world's population, rich countries have been responsible for more than 75% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and thus most of the environmental damage.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, it is the developing countries -- and thus the world's poor -- who are most vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies, to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Working with partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To date, over $1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants, together with about $8 billion in co-financing, have been committed to programs related to climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="18">While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Without a regulatory framework beyond 2012, the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006/2007.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions, project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification, through licensing, financing, and construction, and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool, and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But, without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain, and the private sector -- vital to the market's success -- is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way.</seg>
		<seg id="26">According to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance, only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community -- with no exclusions, although with differentiated responsibilities -- in the pursuit of a more secure world, one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction.</seg>

		<seg id="0">State of the Art, or Art of the State?</seg>
		<seg id="1">September is traditionally the time when opera companies and orchestras return to their home cities from Aix, Salzburg, Tanglewood, and countless other summer festivals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This rentrée is also marked (on both sides of the Atlantic) by the return of worries about how classical music is financed.</seg>
		<seg id="3">American symphonic life is Euro-centric in almost every respect except for its funding.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Whereas Americans depend upon tax-deductible private donations and box office receipts to finance live classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support for the arts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Ironically, while arts advocates in the United States have long argued for adoption of the &quot;European model&quot; -- which has produced a rich and varied artistic life for Europeans -- Europe is being forced to change its system of support to one that depends more on private money and the box office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Unfortunately, Europe's system of direct government financial support is falling victim to Europe's slow economic growth and budget deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Particularly for those countries that have adopted the euro, government spending on the arts will be constrained for some time by the requirement that fiscal deficits be kept to 3% of GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The resulting pressure on Europe's performing arts institutions is causing concern at various different levels.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Traditionally, Europe's social democracies have preferred allocating scarce goods and services like concerts and operas by queues (financed by huge subsidies to keep prices low) rather than by willingness to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Now, this will change.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Performing arts advocates in Europe point to the US where, among other things, music directors of even major orchestras are now expected to fully participate in fundraising activities and be active in the local community on the orchestras behalf.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The same thing, they fear, will happen in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Some conductors, not wanting to carry a tin cup as they wave their batons, have rejected important posts in the US for this reason, feeling that it would interfere with their art.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But US experience shows that getting artistic leaders like orchestra music directors to participate in fundraising need not be bad for the artistic side of the job.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco, for example, has combined effective fundraising and artistic leadership to propel the San Francisco Symphony to the top rank of US orchestras.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It also should be reassuring to Europeans who are concerned that greater reliance on private money necessarily means conservative programming that the San Francisco Symphony has one of the most adventuresome repertoires in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="18">If the audience has progressive tastes, private money and innovative programming are entirely compatible.</seg>
		<seg id="19">A corollary is that public money makes it possible for adventuresome programming even if audience tastes run to the conservative side.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is one reason performing artists in Europe like public money -- it liberates them from a diet of only Beethoven and Mozart.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, the audience may come to appreciate an adventuresome repertoire the more it becomes exposed to it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of course, with reduced public spending on the performing arts, not only will there be greater reliance on private money, but ticket prices will have to rise as well.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Some argue that this is a bad thing, because they prefer queuing to the price system and fear that higher prices will compromise future audiences by excluding young people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth.</seg>
		<seg id="25">First, youth may not take advantage of cheap tickets to the extent that they are not interested in going to hear live classical music at any price.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Second, even if they do want to go, they may not be able to get seats, which often are not available because subscriptions stay in the same hands year after year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">What good are cheap prices, which serve mainly to subsidize the same subscription holders, if there are no seats?</seg>
		<seg id="28">If a taste for classical music is to be subsidized, some more targeted subsidies should be preferred to cheap prices.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The best way to bring youth to the performing arts is through education.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Because American orchestras can't count on schools or government to provide the basic music education necessary to ensure a continuing audience for classical music, some orchestras are doing it themselves with private money.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In San Francisco, for example, the Symphony runs a $23 million privately funded project -- called Keeping Score -- that includes a national public television series, radio shows, interactive music learning, and school music programs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This type of innovative program is relevant for European as well as American orchestras.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The problem of youth and access to the performing arts exists on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="34">So does poor music education in state schools.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If orchestras don't look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Law and Order, Russian-Style</seg>
		<seg id="1">Around the world, people worry that political freedom is disappearing in Vladimir Putin's Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Indeed, about the only people who are unconcerned about creeping authoritarianism in Russia are the Russians themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Russians seem to care less about political freedom than they do about social welfare - pensions, domestic violence, children's rights, or police brutality.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In fact, most Russians are indifferent to the government's efforts to curtail press freedom and limit the right to protest.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Such apathy makes my task as Russia's ombudsman, an office charged by the State Duma (parliament) with protecting political rights in Russia, difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The ombudsman acts as a bridge between the authorities and the people, seeking to resolve conflicts that arise between state bodies and citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="7">My office is open not only to Russian citizens, but to foreigners and stateless people who feel their political rights have been compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The standards we apply are not only those contained in Russia's constitution, but also international legal principles and human rights norms, even if they sometimes contradict our constitution.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For example, as ombudsman, I was opposed to curtailing the right of Russians to jury trials.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Those who wanted to limit the use of juries supposedly feared a risk to state security in some instances.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My office worked closely with the state to assure that, in most cases, juries are used.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Similarly, my office defended the liberal weekly newspaper Novoe Vremya (New Times), which was being pressured by Moscow's city government on the pretext of a commercial dispute about a lease.</seg>
		<seg id="13">That fight is not over, but after my intervention, Moscow's authorities must take into account the public's negative attitude to their effort to quash this publication.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Of course, Russia provides far more headline-grabbling examples of political and human rights problems, such as the low-grade war in Chechnya or the Yukos affair.</seg>
		<seg id="15">My office pays maximum attention to Chechnya, although this is not easy to do from Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Indeed, I could spend all my time in Chechnya, but Russia has 89 regions with countless human rights issues to address.</seg>
		<seg id="17">This is why I suggested to Putin that Chechnya have its own regional rights ombudsman who would spend all his time there.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The new Chechen authorities seem to welcome this prospect.</seg>
		<seg id="19">As to the Yukos affair, my office cannot intervene in any legal process until it is completed.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky's lawyers have sent a complaint to the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg.</seg>
		<seg id="21">If Khodorkovsky disagrees with the final decision of the Russian courts, he will undoubtedly appeal to that court.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only then will I be able to express an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Many observers nonetheless insist that those under criminal investigation should be released on bail instead of being kept in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Others say that this is not an option in Khodorkovsky's case - being very rich, he could easily jump bail and flee abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In fact, this is precisely what happened with other figures accused in the Yukos case.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All of these serious human rights questions expose the fact that Russia's legal institutions remains half-formed.</seg>
		<seg id="27">For example, the Duma has taken far too long to enact a law on lobbying, which in most developed democracies clearly defines what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Khodorkovsky might not be in as much trouble if such precise laws existed.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Unformed laws are directly related to unformed ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Human rights in Russia are often violated simply because people are not aware that they have some particular right.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The most important strategic goal of my office is that people learn how to defend their rights better, and to make the authorities take the complaints of ordinary Russians into consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Sadly, most bureaucrats still look upon human rights values with disdain.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the real problem for my office is neither ignorance nor legal infirmity, it is that in an under-developed legal system such as Russia's, my authority is mostly personal, and requires help from the mass media.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Because concepts of human rights remain rudimentary, the best that can be hoped for is that awareness will slowly begin to take hold.</seg>
		<seg id="35">My tactical goal is thus to raise the public profile of the ombudsman's office, in order to win more respect and recognition by both citizens and the state.</seg>
		<seg id="36">This will be all but impossible without cooperation with non-governmental human rights organizations in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Indeed, I view one of my tasks as being to facilitate contacts between these groups and the authorities.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The government's response to these efforts will be an important indicator of whether and to what extent Putin's administration intends to include human and political rights within its so-called &quot;dictatorship of law.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Revolutionary Conservative Pope</seg>
		<seg id="1">Twenty-five years ago, Poland's people were stunned by the choice of their compatriot, Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow, as Pope.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some were frightened, others wept with joy.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Here, said a prominent writer, was &quot;Poland's second baptism.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">But even in our euphoria, we did not expect how much the new Pope would change not only Poland, but the world.</seg>
		<seg id="5">His first return visit to his native country soon afterwards showed to all the world the new Pope's power.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Communist police disappeared from the main streets of Warsaw, yet the streets became models of order.</seg>
		<seg id="7">After decades of disempowerment, Poles suddenly regained their capacity for self-determination.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In saying aloud that &quot;there can be no just Europe without an independent Poland on its map,&quot; the Pope effectively swept away the unjust postwar settlement that had subjugated Poland to Soviet power.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Then, in Auschwitz, the Pope said: &quot;I speak in the name of everyone whose rights go unrecognized and violated anywhere in the world, I speak because I am bound, we are all bound, by truth.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">On that spot, that Golgotha of modern times, he called the Poles, who remembered dear ones gassed to death in Auschwitz's crematoria as well as those frozen into glass in Siberia's concentration camps, to a brotherhood devoted to struggle against even justified hatred and revenge.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Some see in the Pope the person responsible for a religious revival; others see a man of peace.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Some see a defender of the poor, others a critic of liberation theology.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For the people of Poland, John Paul II, by making human rights the central subject of his teaching, will forever be the man who gave us courage and hope, who restored our historical identity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Indeed, the central feature of the first decade of the Pope's reign was his struggle against dictatorship--Communist dictatorship in particular.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The strategy formulated by the Pope for the Catholic Church, and his ability to mobilize millions of believers in its cause, meant that no one could ever again repeat Stalin's question: &quot;How many divisions does the Pope have?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">John Paul II demonstrated that moral force was a weapon potent enough to undo Yalta's division of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Perhaps in part because of their strong anticommunist stance, the Polish Church and John Paul II are often branded as &quot;conservative.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">The accusation is meant to suggest that the Church cannot live comfortably with a pluralist democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="19">To be sure, in the struggle against Communism, the Polish Church was, indeed, conservative--and thank God for that!</seg>
		<seg id="20">It was conservative in its absolute fidelity to evangelical values, to the truth of faith, to its historical identity.</seg>
		<seg id="21">For the system of official atheism and legalized mendacity, the Church was a living rebuke.</seg>
		<seg id="22">With Communism gone, however, the problem confronted by John Paul II and his Church today is this: in what language can evangelical values be articulated in a world where evil is not incarnated in a political system but is diffused in individual souls?</seg>
		<seg id="23">What is the Pope's message for the postcommunist world he helped create?</seg>
		<seg id="24">John Paul II undoubtedly keeps a distance from liberal economic ideas and the liberal state, which he often charges with permissiveness and moral relativism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">A critique of individualism in the name of collective values occurs frequently in the Pope's pronouncements.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He sees the failings of liberalism as particularly pernicious in postcommunist countries.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The market economy, despite its practical achievements, seems to him oftentimes to lack a heart and a human face.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He sees the market as favoring entrepreneurship over human solidarity.</seg>
		<seg id="29">So John Paul II is no enthusiast of modern Western civilization, with its divorce from the world of values, and he contrasts with it the moral sensitivity of societies with fresh memories of decades of dictatorship.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Like Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Pope tends to believe that it was above all in resistance to totalitarianism that man could become truly free and preserve the fundamental values of civilization.</seg>
		<seg id="31">I confess that I view the heritage of Communism with more skepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Totalitarian pressure did, indeed, form exceptional people such as John Paul II and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, people for whom religious faith bought freedom from mendacity and solitude.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But it did the same for Andrei Sakharov and Vaclav Havel, who defended their supreme values with reference to, and in the language of, lay humanism.</seg>
		<seg id="34">For most people, however, life under totalitarian dictatorship was not ennobling; it was, rather, a daily immersion in lies, spiritual depravity, and material corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is why postcommunist societies do not demonstrate any nobility or disinterestedness that seriously contrasts with the West.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Communism's defeat left a huge black hole in communities' souls, which is now being filled with nationalism, bigotry, and Western consumerism.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But John Paul II's basic intuition is correct: the postcommunist world--East and West--is in spiritual crisis, and the Pope wants to shake it into realizing the importance of higher values.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Indeed, by his words and example, the Pope disrupts the world: it wants to live in wealth and comfort; he reminds us that we must also live in dignity.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In the end, John Paul II does not fit neatly into any category and often represents a meeting of opposites: rejection of compromise with ecumenism, toughness with warmth, intellectual openness with insistence on theological orthodoxy.</seg>
		<seg id="40">He is a conservative who loves freedom and a &quot;peacemonger&quot; who condemns injustice, but who reminds us that mercy is more important than justice.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In this, he personifies the paradox that is Christianity: unbreakable and lasting principles joined by understanding and tolerance.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Twenty-five years after John Paul II left Poland for Rome, we Poles remain grateful to him for having helped us regain our freedom.</seg>
		<seg id="43">It is good that John Paul II is among us.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A world where everything changes needs a guardian of what remains the same.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Intervention Syndrome</seg>
		<seg id="1">Kosovo is often held up as a test case for the concept of &quot;humanitarian&quot; intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But as Iraq spirals into chaos, diplomats and leaders everywhere are again asking themselves if it is ever appropriate for alliances of nations or the international community as a whole to intervene when a sovereign country appears unable or unwilling to defend its citizens from genocide, war crimes, or ethnic cleansing.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At the center of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the &quot;responsibility to protect.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">As the United Nations-appointed Ombudsperson in Kosovo for the past five years, I have had the unique opportunity to observe the aftereffects of that doctrine following NATO's intervention in the former Yugoslavia in 1999.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Kosovo has subsequently become an international experiment in society building, led by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).</seg>
		<seg id="6">Experiment is the right word here.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indeed, Kosovo has become a Petri dish for international intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Having lived and worked long enough in Kosovo to see the outcome so far, I contend that such experiments require further research.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Clearly, the need for international intervention in crises is often time-specific and a fairly swift response is frequently required.</seg>
		<seg id="10">However, apart from military factors, where such intervention is being considered, it is of vital importance to focus international policy discussion on the rapid deployment of a linked civilian and security presence.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This is especially true where human suffering is caused by communal conflict, as was the case in Kosovo.</seg>
		<seg id="12">An immediate deployment of an adequate civilian and security presence during the months immediately after the end of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign might well have provided suitable protective mechanisms against the backlash that allowed victims to become victimizers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">NATO peacekeeping troops were not directed to stop the abductions, disappearances, retaliation killings, and massive property destruction by groups of ethnic Albanians, which led to a vast reverse ethnic cleansing of the non-Albanian (mainly Serb) population.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As a result of this neglect, a noxious social and political residue pervades today's Kosovo.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Instead of cooling communal conflict, interethnic hatred remains as heated as ever.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In addition to the lack of an adequate civilian and security presence to reassure every community of its safety, the overall lack of legal mechanisms to deliver swift justice for crimes committed during and after the intervention created additional tension.</seg>
		<seg id="17">So pervasive is this tension, in fact, that any chance of even beginning the much-needed reconciliation process must now be pushed far into the future.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Similarly, in Kosovo the international community has devoted little time to helping former combatants contemplate their collective responsibility for atrocities, no matter how direct or indirect their personal involvement.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Without such an effort, attempting to improve the situation is like building a house on a sand dune.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This lack of foresight about and planning for the aftermath of armed intervention is not only dangerous to the people who have ostensibly been &quot;saved&quot;; it is counterproductive.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Unless a humanitarian intervention is structured in such a way that it guarantees basic security, the underlying antagonisms that inspired the intervention in the first place will merely be reinforced, not diminished.</seg>
		<seg id="22">So, six years after NATO's intervention, Kosovo seems as far from stability and social peace as ever.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Despite the frequent assurances of UN authorities that Kosovo is on a path toward reconciliation and true home rule, NATO officials indicate that there are plans to maintain a long-term military presence in the province in order to &quot;guarantee that the political process will be concluded successfully.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">This brings me to another key point: a workable exit strategy is just as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the entry strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="25">If an international intervention is to have any credible chance of success, clear criteria for what constitutes &quot;success&quot; are needed from the start.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Only such clarity can allow for a proper end to international actors' engagement.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Kosovo, such clarity is and has been absent; as a result, NATO and the UN have no clear idea about when and how both should leave.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Someone once rightly said that it is easy to bomb, but much harder to build; it is relatively easy to defeat a regime militarily, but it is far more difficult to create a solid, sustainable, civil society in its place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The UN General Assembly should keep this in mind as it starts to codify the doctrine of the &quot;responsibility to protect.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Is Eastern Europe's political pendulum about to run down?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Across Central Europe since 1989, elections have oscillated between right and left.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Is Hungary's slick young prime minister, Viktor Orban, poised to end all that?</seg>
		<seg id="4">A ruthless program to absorb his political rivals on the right has helped Orban's FIDESZ party become nearly equal in size to his Socialist rivals on the left.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Moreover, infighting among the Socialists has dented one of their biggest political advantages: the hard-headed discipline and political professionalism inherited from their Communist days.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Premier Orban's semi-successful efforts to unify the right under the banner of FIDESZ are unique among Eastern Europe's fractured and fractious rightist parties.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Since Communism's fall, center right parties in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia have suffered from disunity and a lack of vision.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Despite the fact the region is still recovering from decades of communist mismanagement, the political right's fragmentation helped the political left, in some cases represented by former Communists, to win democratic elections regularly.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Some problems faced by Central Europe's right are similar to those the political right faces elsewhere in Europe, where social democratic parties expropriated many formerly liberal ideas to seize a monopoly of the political center.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In Central Europe this effect has been amplified by the fact that, regardless of ideological leanings, rulings parties have had to privatize the economy and, under pressure from the European Union, introduce reform measures that would, in a classical Western system, usually be undertaken by the political right.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Leftist parties in various Central European countries, indeed, have often turned out to be more successful in reforming because they, paradoxically, have greater legitimacy in this respect.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Many people believe that the Socialists would not privatize the economy or slash welfare systems if such measures were not absolutely necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The most serious problem of Central Europe's political right is a lack of identity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Although right-of-center politicians in Central European countries formally embrace traditional ideologies, for example, liberalism or conservatism, their electorates, unfamiliar with Western political philosophies, do not always understand the real meaning of those terms.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In various surveys, significant segments of Central European electorates describe themselves as ``rightist,'' but years of communist paternalism pushed the region's political center of gravity firmly to the left.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A person may describe him or herself as, for example, a liberal, yet at same time demand that the government continue subsidizing energy, education, or housing.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Under the communist regimes, ideologies became totally instrumental.</seg>
		<seg id="18">As during those years, many people now formally accept ideological labels but identify with them only as long as such an allegiance to a specific political current has tangible short-term benefits for them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One consequence of this cynical treatment of political ideologies is the wild swings in voters' preferences seen in various Central European countries.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The problem of identity is made even worse by the fact that most Central European nations, where nation-building was retarded by Communism, easily succumb to nationalist sentiments that in turn are misused by some politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Although such politicians often describe themselves as ``rightist,'' their real policies, such as, for, example, those of former Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, are in fact demagogic populist or authoritarian.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The situation of the political right in each Central European country is also influenced by experiences that are rooted in history and tradition.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Political developments in Czechoslovakia during the last 20 years of communism set the Czech Republic and Slovakia apart from both Poland and Hungary.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While both the Polish and Hungarian communist parties experienced internal liberalization that allowed relatively large semi-official zones of activity outside communist control, Czechoslovakia after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 became a rigid neo-Stalinist regime.</seg>
		<seg id="25">When the communist regimes collapsed in 1989, the communist parties of Poland and Hungary transformed themselves into credible democratic-left parties that became formidable opponents of the newly emerging political right.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No strong social democratic party in Czechoslovakia could emerge from the rigid Czechoslovak Communist Party.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In the absence of a credible democratic left party, Czech center-right politicians had the upper hand, and were relatively united, until 1997.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, lack of a strong opposition corrupted the political right, which splintered into various groupings that cannot find a common language.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In Slovakia, where nationalist sentiments were an important political factor after 1989, the political spectrum has not yet coalesced along standard right-left political axis.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The main political battles occur between nationalist/populist forces, whose outlook have in essence been undemocratic, and forces that struggle for standard democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The threat of return to power by Meciar forced all democrats, leftist or rightist, into one camp.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Even in this situation the political right has been quarrelsome, creating space for Meciar's possible return to power.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Hungary's political right has suffered mainly from differences between conservative and populist forces on the one hand, and traditional, mainly urban, liberals on the other.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Various rightist parties failed to decide whether the modus operandi on the political right should be traditional Western ideologies or a Hungarian brand of nationalist conservatism and populism.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Although the current governing coalition, consisting of conservatives and populists, has been successful, the real reckoning for Hungary's right may still be yet to come.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Poland's right poses the most difficult case.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Its problems originate in the communist era, when a trade union movement, which under normal circumstances should stand to the political left, became the main anti-communist opposition.</seg>
		<seg id="38">As a result, various political groups associated with the Solidarity trade union movement have, since Communism's fall, aspired to represent the political right, confusing the terms of political discourse.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Christian-democratic parties, associated with the Catholic Church, and the liberals have been to some extent marginalized.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The confusion has been made complete by the existence of relatively strong nationalist and populist parties that use the numerous Polish farmers as their electoral base.</seg>
		<seg id="41">As in other postcommunist countries, the main beneficiary of such a lack of unity has been the democratic left.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Wall-to-Wall Wal-Mart?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Do you want to know which video clip will soon be scaring the daylights out of policymakers throughout the world?</seg>
		<seg id="2">In a scenario that looks uncannily like the spread of a global pandemic, the economist Thomas Holmes has prepared a dynamic map simulation showing the spread of Wal-Mart stores throughout the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Starting at the epicenter in Bentonville, Arkansas, where Sam Walton opened his first store in 1962, giant boxy Wal-Mart stores have now multiplied to the point where the average American lives less than seven kilometers from an outlet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Interestingly, the video shows how the stores spread out like petals of a flower, ever thickening and expanding.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Rather than jumping out to the coasts -- 80% of all Americans live within 80 kilometers of the Pacific or Atlantic oceans -- Wal-Marts have spread organically through an ever-expanding supply chain.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby, ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain's overall growth.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Love them or hate them, what is undeniable is that Wal-Mart is the quintessential example of the costs and benefits of modern globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Consumers pay significantly less than at traditional outlets.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For example, economists estimate that the food section of Wal-Mart charges 25% less than a typical large supermarket chain.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The differences in price for many other consumer goods is even larger.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Consider the following stunning fact: together with a few sister &quot;big box&quot; stores (Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot), Wal-Mart accounts for roughly 50% of America's much vaunted productivity growth edge over Europe during the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Fifty percent!</seg>
		<seg id="13">Similar advances in wholesaling supply chains account for another 25%!</seg>
		<seg id="14">The notion that Americans have gotten better at everything while other rich countries have stood still is thus wildly misleading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The US productivity miracle and the emergence of Wal-Mart-style retailing are virtually synonymous.</seg>
		<seg id="16">I have nothing against big box stores.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They are an enormous boon to low-income consumers, partly compensating for the tepid wage growth that many of them have suffered during the past two decades.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And I don't agree with friends of mine who turn their noses down at Wal-Mart stores, and claim never to have visited one.</seg>
		<seg id="19">As a consumer, I think big-box stores are great.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They have certainly been great for America's trading partners; Wal-Mart alone accounts for over 10% of all US imports from China.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But I do have some reservations about the Wal-Mart model as a blueprint for global growth.</seg>
		<seg id="22">First, there is the matter of its effect on low-wage workers and smaller-scale retailers.</seg>
		<seg id="23">While completely legal, studies suggest that Wal-Mart's labor policies exploit regulatory loopholes that, for example, allow it to sidestep the burden of healthcare costs for many workers (Wal-Mart provides healthcare coverage to less than half its workers).</seg>
		<seg id="24">And the entry of big-box stores into a community crushes long-established retailers, often traumatically transforming their character.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Yes, to some extent, such is the price of progress.</seg>
		<seg id="26">But the loss of aesthetics and community is not easily captured in simple income and price statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Big-box stores are not exactly attractive -- hence their name.</seg>
		<seg id="28">If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth?</seg>
		<seg id="29">Indeed, many Europeans, and others, will view Holmes's video simulation of Wal-Mart's spread as a horror film.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The French may have invented the hyper mart -- the forerunner of the big-box store -- but they never intended to let their growth go unchecked.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The big question for Europeans is whether they can find ways to exploit some of the efficiency gains embodied by the Wal-Mart model without being overrun by it.</seg>
		<seg id="32">For Americans, there is the additional question of what to do when the big-box store phenomenon has run its course.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If so much of the US productivity edge really amounts to letting Wal-Mart and its big-box cousins run amok, what will happen after this source of growth tapers off?</seg>
		<seg id="34">The US economy has many other strengths, including its superior financial system and leading position in high-tech capital goods, but the fact remains that America's advantage in these areas has so far not been nearly as striking as the Wal-Mart phenomenon.</seg>
		<seg id="35">It is curious how many people seem to think that the US will grow faster than Europe and Japan over the next ten years simply because it has done so for the past ten years.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Wal-Mart and its ilk are a central feature of the modern era of globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They are not quite the pandemic that their explosive growth pattern resembles, but nor is their emergence completely benign.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Those who would aim to emulate US productivity trends must come to grips with how they feel about big-box stores sprouting across their countryside's, driving down wages and plowing under smaller-scale retailers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Americans, in turn, must think about where the proper balance lies between aesthetics, community, and low prices.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Embracing Science</seg>
		<seg id="1">Long-term economic progress comes mainly from the invention and spread of improved technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India's escape from famine by increased farm yields -- the so-called &quot;Green Revolution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Today's era of globalization emerged with the spread of computers and the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Thus, when we seek solutions to some of the world's toughest problems, they, too, are likely to be found, at least in part, in new technologies that can resolve old and seemingly intractable problems.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Consider poverty in Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Every conceivable explanation has been given, usually focusing on what Africans do wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But a visit to Africa's villages makes clear that the problems have more to do with the struggle for survival under difficult physical conditions than with any special problems that are unique to African societies.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Africa's farmers produce roughly one-third or less food per hectare of farmland than their counterparts around the world, resulting in massive hunger, which is exacerbated by a heavy disease burden.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Malaria poses a unique challenge, owing in large part to Africa's mosquito species, which are especially adept at transmitting the disease.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Other tropical parasitic diseases imply similarly extraordinary burdens in Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Add the practical difficulties of broken-down roads and few cars and trucks, and economic isolation follows.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So the challenges of survival are enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Yet practical solutions are at hand, because simple and low-cost technologies can address specific problems.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Low farm yields can be addressed through improved seed varieties specially adapted for African conditions, combined with technologies for replenishing soil and managing water.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Malaria can be controlled through newly designed long-lasting mosquito nets and a new generation of effective medicines.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Other tropical diseases also can be controlled, and practical technologies for safe drinking water can dramatically reduce diarrheal diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mobile phones, local wireless Internet, and more paved roads could do much to break the economic isolation of Africa's villages.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Donor countries incessantly ask Africans to change their trade policies, government institutions, public administration, and more.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Some of these changes are important, but the role of the rich countries has been lopsided, focusing on everything except how to finance and introduce practical technologies to solve practical problems.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The rich countries' mistakes wouldn't matter if African countries had enough money to adopt the needed technologies on their own, but Africa is so poor that it must get financial help to escape poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The development challenges in Africa are just one example of how tough societal problems can be addressed by the design and spread of improved technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The same will be true of how the world best addresses manmade climate change -- another of those seemingly intractable global problems.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Right now, rich countries are changing the world's climate by emitting billions of tons of carbon dioxide each year from the use of coal, oil, and natural gas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In future years, China and India also will make massive contributions to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Yet no country, rich or poor, is keen to cut its energy use, owing to concern that to do so would threaten jobs, incomes, and economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">New technologies will provide a key part of the solution.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Already, &quot;hybrid&quot; automobiles, which combine gasoline and battery power, can roughly double fuel efficiency, cutting carbon dioxide emissions by half.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Similarly, engineers have developed ways to capture the carbon dioxide that results from burning coal in power plants and store it safely underground.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This new technology, called &quot;carbon capture and sequestration,&quot; can cut by 80% the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of electricity.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The costs appear relatively small.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Consider also the depletion of ocean fisheries through over-fishing.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Global demand for fish consumption is growing, and so, too, is the global capacity to catch fish, driving some species to the point of extinction.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Improved aquaculture, in which fish are grown at manmade fishponds and reservoirs is still far from being a perfect technology, mainly for environmental reasons, yet it is enormously promising.</seg>
		<seg id="34">On a recent visit to Africa, a senior agricultural scientist said that in today's world, the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer, but farther away than ever from the policymakers.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Politicians don't understand science, and rarely seek the advice of scientists and engineers in addressing major issues.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Everything is viewed as politics and votes, not as technical problems requiring technological expertise, which is why Africa's poverty is so often attributed to corruption rather than to ecological challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It is easy to dismiss the suggestion that technology can save the day.</seg>
		<seg id="38">After all, technological advance also requires good governance, market forces, effective universities, and more.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Politics will still play its role.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Nevertheless, it's time to recognize that governments are ill-equipped to understand the sophisticated technological challenges and opportunities facing the world, and that new ways are needed to ensure that science and technology are given the prominence needed to address a wide range of increasingly urgent global problems.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Now is the time for every major international agency and national government to assume responsibility for gaining the scientific and technological expertise that they will need in the twenty-first century.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Getting Latin America Unstuck</seg>
		<seg id="1">One of the world economy's biggest puzzles is Latin America's poor performance.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Since the early 1980's, Latin America has been stuck, with per capita incomes growing slowly (if at all) in most of the region, and with one big crisis following another.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Many policies have been tried, especially trade liberalization, privatization of inefficient state enterprises, and budgetary reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Yet something is holding Latin America back.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The lack of vigorous growth is all the more bewildering in view of Latin America's many advantages and social successes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Natural resources are plentiful, with vast amounts of fertile land.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Health conditions are reasonably good, and all Latin American countries have made headway against illiteracy, with most reaching 90% adult literacy or higher.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Moreover, fertility rates have fallen sharply, to a point where populations in many countries will probably level off in coming decades.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Women's status has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with even higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Latin America may be known for its &quot;macho&quot; culture, but women increasingly participate in the labor force and attain prominent political and social positions.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Latin America boasts still other long-term advantages.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most people live near the coasts, with good access to international trade, and most live in cities - another advantage for growth.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Indeed, the region is not poor by international standards, but rather stuck in the middle-income range between the world's poorest places and the high-income countries of North America, Europe, and East Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="14">What, then, accounts for the puzzling lack of real growth over the past 25 years?</seg>
		<seg id="15">I blame two unsolved, but solvable, problems.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The first has been around for centuries: the social divisions that trace their origins back to the European conquest over Native Americans in the sixteenth century.</seg>
		<seg id="17">More than most places, Latin America was born in violent conquest.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Europeans subdued Amerindian populations and also brought in massive numbers of slaves from Africa, especially to the Caribbean basin and Brazil.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Societies became racially and ethnically complex, as the European, Amerindian, and African populations intermarried, but the long-term trend of European dominance, indigenous and Afro-American subservience, and entrenched poverty became a scar on Latin American societies.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Even today, income inequality in Latin America is among the highest in the world, reflecting the old patterns of ethnic and racial division.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Income inequality casts a long shadow.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The rich have long fought against taxation needed to increase investment in the education and health of the poor, perpetuating deep social divisions and leaving many people without the health and skills that global competitiveness requires.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The situation today is improving in some places - such as Brazil - which augurs well for the future.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In other places - for example, Guatemala and parts of the Andean region - social divisions remain fraught with violence and distrust.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Beyond this, a basic failure of economic strategy has been largely overlooked, one that is reflected in a major difference between public policy discussions in Latin America and Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In Asia, public debate is about technology: how can Asia catch up?</seg>
		<seg id="27">Asian governments relentlessly act to raise the scientific and technological capacities of their economies.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In Latin America, the global technological revolution is much less discussed, and national policies to promote science and technology are rarely given prominence.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The result is that Latin America has failed to benefit adequately from the global technological revolutions.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Asian developing countries are now producers of computers, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and software.</seg>
		<seg id="31">By contrast, even Latin America's star performer, Chile, remains largely a resource-based export economy, with a heavy concentration in copper and agricultural exports.</seg>
		<seg id="32">These sectors are technologically sophisticated, but form a narrow base for long-term development.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The situation is far from hopeless.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Brazil has demonstrated the ability to be a technological export power.</seg>
		<seg id="35">It has succeeded, notably, in exporting airplanes and many consumer durable goods.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mexico, too, has begun to mobilize significant technological prowess.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Argentina, Chile, and other countries could become high-tech agricultural producers, in the forefront of agro-biotechnology for example, if they put their minds to it.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Still, Latin American countries have not yet tried to foster a technological revolution, certainly not with the focus, skill, commitment, and financing that Asian countries have shown.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Such a push could play a major role in jump-starting economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Such a policy would entail committing to a major increase in spending on research and development, as Asian developing countries have done.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Latin American countries should aim to increase spending to around 2% of GNP (from 0.5% currently), partly through public support for laboratories and universities and partly through incentives for private-sector R&amp;amp;D. They should roll out the red carpet for high-tech multinational firms, just as Asia has done.</seg>
		<seg id="42">They should also increase their focus on scientific and technological training and encourage a higher proportion of students to go on to university education.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Government stipends for tuition and for new and enlarged universities can play a big role, as can investment in computers and information technology in schools and communities.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The social agenda and the technology agenda are not independent of each other.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Both call upon Latin American societies to invest more in their people, so that Latin Americans can join the cutting edge of global productivity.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If these investments reach all parts of Latin America, rich and poor, the region's prospects will brighten enormously.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Are Housing Prices a House of Cards?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The first big city to boom was London, starting around 1996.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Boom mentality spread to Los Angeles, New York, and Sydney around 1997, to Paris in 1998, to Miami, Moscow, and Shanghai in 2001, and Vancouver around 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="3">These and other cities have been booming pretty much ever since; prices in most are up at least 50% in real terms since 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This has been a big windfall to homeowners, but has hurt anyone planning to buy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now growth in home prices is weakening in some of these cities.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The rate of price growth in London and New York slowed sharply over the past year, to only about a 1% real increase in the second quarter of 2004.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In Sydney, home prices actually fell in the second quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Has the boom ended?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Will no other cities benefit?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Worse still, could the mood in housing markets soon lead prices in downward?</seg>
		<seg id="11">No one predicted this boom, so predicting its end is risky.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Housing prices have shown tremendous upward momentum in the face of previous warnings that the party is over.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Any prediction concerning the boom's end requires understanding why it occurred in so many places.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Surprisingly, there is no well-received explanation, because this boom's ultimate causes are mostly psychological.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Economists would rather talk about interest rates or unemployment statistics - factors that are concrete and knowable.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Of course, these indicators do have a legitimate role to play in explaining housing markets, but they are simply not adequate to account for the recent booms.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Three psychological causes stand out: first, a change in people's perceptions about the source of value in a changing world economy; second, increasing public faith in &quot;glamour&quot; cities with international name recognition; and third, the plain giddy dynamics of speculative bubbles.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Each factor deserves greater attention if we are to understand current housing market conditions and discern future price trends.</seg>
		<seg id="19">First, the world economy does look more chaotic than it did a decade ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The crash in equity prices since 2000 in most countries has made financial assets look less secure, spurring a &quot;flight to quality&quot; - in this case, housing.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, terrorism is now viewed as a problem for everyone, with major tragedies in Indonesia, Spain, and Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="22">People feel safest investing in their homes, and there is little reason to expect imminent change.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Fear and upward momentum in home prices go together.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Second, the public's faith in glamorous international cities has increased with the explosive growth in global communications due to the Internet and the cell phone.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Just as people increasingly admire international celebrities, so they believe that world famous centers of business, technology, and culture - whose names are household words to people everywhere - are uniquely valuable.</seg>
		<seg id="26">As with fear of terrorism and suspicion of equities, geographical celebrity appears resilient, if not self-reinforcing: the more famous New York, Paris, and London get, the more glamorous they become.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Third, and no less important, is the speculative contagion that underlies any bubble.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The current boom has seen contagion within markets and across markets, as rising prices fuel popular excitement - and hence further price increases - in the same city, and then in other cities, even on the other side of the globe.</seg>
		<seg id="29">People in Shanghai may not talk about London home prices, but Shanghai's opinion leaders know what is happening in London, and the boom there makes it seem plausible that there should be a boom in Shanghai, too.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In contrast to the other two psychological causes, speculative contagion has a natural end.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A speculative bubble, sustaining itself solely by reaction to price increases, cannot go on forever.</seg>
		<seg id="32">So, where does this leave us?</seg>
		<seg id="33">Two of the three psychological causes suggest continued upward momentum in housing prices, while the third suggests that the momentum will come to an end some day, but does not pinpoint when.</seg>
		<seg id="34">I am betting that some high-flying glamour cities will continue to see decelerating growth in home prices - and eventually decreases.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Historically, housing prices have shown a lot of momentum, and prices in all these cities are still going up at a brisk rate, though usually somewhat slower than a year or more ago.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Based on extrapolation of growth trends, it looks safe to predict that prices will go up substantially in most of these places for another year or more, even as the rate of increase continues to decline.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The psychological factors are more important for longer-term forecasts, beyond a year, where momentum no longer plays an important role.</seg>
		<seg id="38">At this point, there is likely to be some downward instability in prices, because enthusiasm for investing in houses is likely to wane in line with declining price growth.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Prices in glamour cities are likely to drop sharply the next time there is a serious recession, or if the local economy suffers a severe shock, or if interest rates rise too fast.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Then, contagion within and across markets can work in a downward direction, propelling prices lower for years.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Water for All</seg>
		<seg id="1">This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is an opportune moment: while much of the world's attention has been fixed on issues of energy supply and security, hundreds of millions of people in the developing world continue to see the supply and security of fresh water as equally, if not more, important.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Surveys undertaken by the World Bank in developing countries show that, when poor people are asked to name the three most important concerns they face, &quot;good health&quot; is always mentioned.</seg>
		<seg id="4">And a key determinant of whether they will have good health or not is access to clean water.</seg>
		<seg id="5">More than a billion people around the world today do not.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As a result, they are increasingly vulnerable to poor health.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The World Bank estimates that by 2035, as many as three billion people, almost all of them in developing countries, could live under conditions of severe water stress, especially if they happen to live in Africa, the Middle East, or South Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This will cause obvious hardship, but it will also hold back the economic growth needed for millions of people to escape poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In Latin America, about 15% of the population -- roughly 76 million people -- do not have access to safe water, and 116 million people do not have access to sanitation services.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The figures are worse in Africa and parts of Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This is a situation that few people in rich countries face.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Generally, these countries' citizens enjoy services that provide for all water needs, from drinking to irrigation to sanitation.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In addition, other water-related issues, such as the risks posed by flooding, have been reduced to manageable levels.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rich industrial countries have invested early and heavily in water infrastructure, institutions, and management capacities.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The result, beyond the health benefits for all, has been a proven record of economic growth; one only has to look at investment in hydropower to see the positive impact of water management projects on many economies.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Granted, rich countries have a certain advantage: they benefit from generally moderate climates, with regular rainfall and relatively low risks of drought and flooding.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Even so, they are not immune to water-related disasters, as Hurricane Katrina's destruction of New Orleans taught us.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the impact of such events on poor countries is much greater.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Extreme rainfall variations, floods, and droughts can have huge social and economic effects and result in the large-scale loss of life.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Gulf coast of Mexico and Central American countries has repeatedly experienced such tragedies, with poor communities the most vulnerable and the least able to cope.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Ethiopia's development potential is closely tied to seasonal rains, so high rainfall variation, together with lack of infrastructure, has undermined growth and perpetuated poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A single drought can cut growth potential by 10% over an extended period.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Yemen, for its part, has no perennial surface water; its citizens depend entirely on rainfall, groundwater, and flash flooding.</seg>
		<seg id="25">To move forward, developing countries need new water infrastructure and better management.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Any approach must be tailored to the circumstances of each country and the needs of its people, but there is no fundamental constraint to designing water development investments that ensure that local communities and the environment gain tangible and early benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In some countries, new water infrastructure may mean canals, pumping stations, and levees.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Still others might need deeper reservoirs, more modern filtration plants, or improved water transport schemes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">These can all potentially be designed to improve and expand water supplies for power generation, irrigation, and household and industrial use, while providing security against droughts and protection from floods.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The key to successful increased investment in water infrastructure is an equally increased investment in water institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Badly managed infrastructure will do little to improve peoples' health or support economic growth, so water development and water management must go hand in hand.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, great attention to the environment, and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="33">A water investment policy that reduces the vulnerability of the poor and offers basic water security for all will require customized planning and an effective partnership of donor countries, developing country governments, the private sector, and local communities.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Delegates to the World Water Forum will have ample opportunity to forge and/or strengthen these partnerships.</seg>
		<seg id="35">If they succeed, the rewards for the world's poor will be immense.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Germany's Five Shocks</seg>
		<seg id="1">Over the last decade, Germany has been the slowest growing economy in the European Union, and Europe has been the slowest growing continent in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">From 1995 to 2005, Germany will have grown by only 14.6%, while the old EU on average will have grown by 24%, the US by 39.9%, and the world economy by 45.6%.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Why has Germany performed so badly?</seg>
		<seg id="4">One theory, endorsed by the head of Germany's ruling Social Democratic Party, Franz Müntefering, is that Germany is already where the others still want to be.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Slow German growth, he maintains, is a sign of natural convergence.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But this theory is not convincing.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Germany has recently been overtaken in terms of per capita income by several EU countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, and France, and is still growing more slowly than all of them.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Another, more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years there have been various external challenges or shocks that have hit the country simultaneously.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Rigid as it was, with an extensive welfare system and an over-regulated labor market, Germany was unable to react to these shocks and ran into trouble.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This theory recalls that of the British historian Arnold Toynbee, according to which empires collapse because they are unable to react to external challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The first shock was intensified globalization, which brought a lot of new low-wage competition.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Although globalization is a gradual process, it gained momentum when China decided to play the game.</seg>
		<seg id="13">China is ten times the size of Japan, and Japan was not easy to deal with, either.</seg>
		<seg id="14">German precision instruments and optical equipment, for example, lost their competitive edge when Japan entered the game.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The second shock was EU integration, including the northern and southern enlargements.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The dismantling of the EU's internal borders boosted each country's market size and brought about the predicted economies of scale.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But this helped Europe's small countries more than the big ones, and it implied more competition for Germany, Europe's biggest economy.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Think of Nokia, the mobile phone maker.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Due to the economies of scale that the common market made possible, Nokia was able to exploit its inventions fully, while Germany's Siemens recently decided to give up on the mobile phone market.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The third shock was the euro, which has induced a rapid convergence of long-term interest rates, which in some countries had been five to seven percentage points above the German level.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Freed from exchange-rate risk, international investors no longer demanded a risk premium from these countries and were willing to provide funds to all of them under the same favorable conditions that previously had been reserved for Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This is good for Europe, because it helps improve the allocation of capital and stimulates growth by transporting German savings to the remote and previously disadvantaged regions of the euro zone.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But it is of doubtful benefit to German workers who also would have liked to cooperate with that capital.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The fourth shock was eastern EU enlargement, which has brought extraordinary chances for trade and investment in the east, but has also brought massive low-wage competition.</seg>
		<seg id="25">On average, wage costs in the ten countries that joined the EU in 2004 are only 14% of the West German level.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Low-wage competition has led to substantial outsourcing and off-shoring activities that have kept German firms competitive by reducing their demand for domestic labor.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As neither Germany's unions nor its welfare state would accept falling wages, the result was higher unemployment and slower growth.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The fifth shock was German unification, which is a failure in economic terms.</seg>
		<seg id="29">GDP per working-age person in East Germany had been 61% of the West German level in 1996, but it is now only 59%.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has pulled down the Germany-wide average, while the enormous demand for public funds in the east has increased public debt.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The weak fiscal position has in turn undermined investors' confidence, with obvious implications for economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="32">All five shocks constitute historical developments that are good for the world as a whole, but problematic for Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In order for the country to meet the challenges and to continue to grow, it would have to make its labor markets flexible.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Only if wages adjust downward to accommodate the new international environment can German workers become competitive again, so that the country returns to a higher employment level, exploiting its human capital up to the capacity constraint.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The new government that voters will most likely elect in September will be confronted with the difficult task of confronting Germans with reality and pushing through the necessary reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Only then will we know whether Germany can meet the Toynbeean challenge it is facing.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Lessons from the Tsunami</seg>
		<seg id="1">There are many lessons that emerge from the tsunami that brought such devastation and loss of life to Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It demonstrated the power of globalization, as television brought vivid pictures of the destruction to homes around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, it is at times like this that the world truly does seem like a global village.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Of course, it seemed to take somewhat longer for news of the extent of the disaster to reach the Crawford, Texas, ranch of President Bush.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But, in the end, he decided to interrupt his vacation and offer amounts of aid that were successively revised upwards, in a global competition which promised to benefit those who were desperate for help.</seg>
		<seg id="6">America's aid still appeared niggardly when compared with the amounts offered by countries with a fraction of America's economic wealth.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Lightly populated Australia offered more than twice America's assistance, Japan promised almost 50% more, and Europe pledged more than five times as much.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This led many observers to reflect on the fact that the world's richest country was in general the most miserly in foreign assistance -- all the more so in comparison to the amount it spends on war and defense.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The disaster was international, so it was appropriate that the United Nations take the lead in coordinating the relief effort.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Unfortunately, in an effort that was widely seen as another attempt to undermine multilateralism, the US tried to lead a &quot;core group&quot; driving the assistance program, ignoring ongoing efforts within the region and at the UN.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Whatever America's motive, it later wisely decided to join the UN effort.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Bush administration's face-saving rhetoric that it had rushed to push together the core group in the absence of other efforts was quietly let to pass.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The response of some countries within the region was truly impressive, showing how far they had come in establishing efficient and effective governments.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Myriad details were addressed: Thailand flew ambassadors to the affected part of the country to help attend to the needs of their citizens, helped those who lost their money and passports return home, provided health care for the injured, set up systems to identify bodies, and dealt with the difficulties posed by shortages of body bags and the lack of cold storage facilities.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Countries, like Thailand, that felt that they could handle the finances on their own asked that assistance be directed to others.</seg>
		<seg id="16">They did ask one thing: a reduction of tariff barriers and greater access to markets abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They didn't want a handout, only a chance to earn income.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The response, at least at the time of this column's writing, has mostly been deafening silence.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the other hand, the G-7 made a truly important contribution in offering debt relief.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is especially important for Indonesia, which must service a debt of $132 billion (of which $70 billion is owed to public creditors or guaranteed by government agencies).</seg>
		<seg id="21">Even without the tsunami, this debt burden would have been an enormous hindrance to the country's development as it finally recovers from the aftermath of the 1997 financial crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Indeed, there is a compelling case to be made for Indonesian debt relief in any case, given that much of the debt was incurred in loans to the corrupt Suharto government.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Lenders knew, or should have known, that not all of the money was going to help Indonesian development.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Moreover, some of the debt was incurred as part of the 1997-1998 crisis, which was aggravated and deepened by IMF-imposed policies.</seg>
		<seg id="25">No one pretends that we can prevent or alter the forces of nature.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Rather, we have to learn to cope with them.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are now calls for improved tsunami early warning systems.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But in one area, global warming, we have already received an early warning.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most countries have recognized this, coming together in Rio and Kyoto to do something about it—not enough, but the Kyoto protocol was intended only as a start.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Sadly, global warming will likely destroy some of the same countries ravaged by the tsunami.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Low lying islands like the Maldives will become submerged.</seg>
		<seg id="32">We are, however, still not a global village.</seg>
		<seg id="33">After first disputing that there was scientific evidence of the problem, the largest polluter in the world, the US, is now simply refusing to do anything about it (other than preaching voluntary restraint—of which there is little evidence, at least in America).</seg>
		<seg id="34">The international community has yet to figure out what to do with an aberrant member who fails to live up to its responsibilities as a global citizen.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Optimists say that technology will solve the problem.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Realists observe that in the long race between the environment and technology, it appears that technology has so far been losing.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Nature, as we have learned from the tsunami, has its own timetable.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Unless we learn how to respect it, we will all miss the boat.</seg>

		<seg id="0">How Accurate Are Your Pet Pundits?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Every day, experts bombard us with their views on topics as varied as Iraqi insurgents, Bolivian coca growers, European central bankers, and North Korea's Politburo.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But how much credibility should we attach to the opinions of experts?</seg>
		<seg id="3">The sanguine view is that as long as those selling expertise compete vigorously for the attention of discriminating buyers (the mass media), market mechanisms will assure quality control.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Pundits who make it into newspaper opinion pages or onto television and radio must have good track records; otherwise, they would have been weeded out.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Skeptics, however, warn that the mass media dictate the voices we hear and are less interested in reasoned debate than in catering to popular prejudices.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As a result, fame could be negatively, not positively, correlated with long-run accuracy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Until recently, no one knew who is right, because no one was keeping score.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But the results of a 20-year research project now suggest that the skeptics are closer to the truth.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I describe the project in detail in my book Expert Political Judgment: How good is it?</seg>
		<seg id="10">How can we know?</seg>
		<seg id="11">The basic idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and then score the predictions for accuracy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We find that the media not only fail to weed out bad ideas, but that they often favor bad ideas, especially when the truth is too messy to be packaged neatly.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The evidence falls into two categories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">First, as the skeptics warned, when hordes of pundits are jostling for the limelight, many are tempted to claim that they know more than they do.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Boom and doom pundits are the most reliable over-claimers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Between 1985 and 2005, boomsters made 10-year forecasts that exaggerated the chances of big positive changes in both financial markets (e.g., a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000) and world politics (e.g., tranquility in the Middle East and dynamic growth in sub-Saharan Africa).</seg>
		<seg id="17">They assigned probabilities of 65% to rosy scenarios that materialized only 15% of the time.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the same period, doomsters performed even more poorly, exaggerating the chances of negative changes in all the same places where boomsters accentuated the positive, plus several more (I still await the impending disintegration of Canada, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium, and Sudan).</seg>
		<seg id="19">They assigned probabilities of 70% to bleak scenarios that materialized only 12% of the time.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Second, again as the skeptics warned, over-claimers rarely pay penalties for being wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Indeed, the media shower lavish attention on over-claimers while neglecting their humbler colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="22">We can see this process in sharp relief when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts as &quot;hedgehogs&quot; or &quot;foxes.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">Hedgehogs are big-idea thinkers in love with grand theories: libertarianism, Marxism, environmentalism, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Their self-confidence can be infectious.</seg>
		<seg id="25">They know how to stoke momentum in an argument by multiplying reasons why they are right and others are wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="26">That wins them media acclaim.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But they don't know when to slam the mental brakes by making concessions to other points of view.</seg>
		<seg id="28">They take their theories too seriously.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The result: hedgehogs make more mistakes, but they pile up more hits on Google.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Eclectic foxes are better at curbing their ideological enthusiasms.</seg>
		<seg id="31">They are comfortable with protracted uncertainty about who is right even in bitter debates, conceding gaps in their knowledge and granting legitimacy to opposing views.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They sprinkle their conversations with linguistic qualifiers that limit the reach of their arguments: ‘but,' ‘however,' ‘although.'</seg>
		<seg id="33">Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Foxes will often agree with hedgehogs up to a point, before complicating things: &quot;Yes, my colleague is right that the Saudi monarchy is vulnerable, but remember that coups are rare and that the government commands many means of squelching opposition.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="35">Imagine your job as a media executive depends on expanding your viewing audience.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Whom would you pick: an expert who balances conflicting arguments and concludes that the likeliest outcome is more of the same, or an expert who gets viewers on the edge of their seats over radical Islamists seizing control and causing oil prices to soar?</seg>
		<seg id="37">In short, the qualities that make foxes more accurate also make them less popular.</seg>
		<seg id="38">At this point, uncharitable skeptics chortle that we get the media we deserve.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But that is unfair.</seg>
		<seg id="40">No society has yet created a widely trusted method for keeping score on the punditocracy.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Even citizens who prize accuracy have little way of knowing that they are sacrificing it when they switch channels from boring foxes to charismatic hedgehogs.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Here, then, is a modest proposal that applies to all democracies: the marketplace of ideas works better if it is easier for citizens to see the trade-offs between accuracy and entertainment, or between accuracy and party loyalty.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Wouldn't they be more likely to read pundits with better track records?</seg>
		<seg id="44">If so, pundits might adapt to accountability by showing more humility, and political debate might begin to sound less shrill.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Granted, it is not easy to create methods of keeping score that are credible across the spectrum of reasonable opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But in a world where, as Yeats said, &quot;and the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity,&quot; it is worth trying.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What Next for Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="1">In many ways, 2005 has been Europe's annus horibilis.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It began well, when Spanish voters approved the draft European Union constitution, but it turned sour when French and Dutch voters spurned it soon after.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Those votes partly reflected displeasure with domestic policies, and partly disappointment with the way governments conduct European affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Governments promptly obliged with more of the same.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Within days of the votes, they failed to agree on the EU budget for 2007-13.</seg>
		<seg id="6">French and British leaders engaged in a heated quarrel that derailed the subsequent summit, before Britain assumed the rotating six-month EU presidency in July.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Normally, countries use their EU presidencies to display their ability to solve problems and move the Union forward.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But, as of early December, Britain has remained dormant.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Besides burying the draft constitution, it has largely sidestepped the budget issue.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim, and, unless the dispute is resolved soon, the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Even if a budget is adopted, there is no lack of depressing business for the Austrian presidency, which starts on January 1.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The deepest problem is Europe's inability to grow at more than a snail's pace and to provide jobs to its citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This is mostly due to the Big Three -- France, Germany, and Italy -- which produce 70% of Europe's GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The collective response, adopted in 2000, has been the &quot;Lisbon Strategy,&quot; which aims at making the EU &quot;the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world&quot; by 2010.</seg>
		<seg id="15">More realistically, it is designed to provide governments with the incentive to undertake the reforms that stimulate economic growth and productivity.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That means facing down the myriad interest groups -- from industry lobbies to trade unions and entrenched bureaucracies -- that have (so far) successfully protected their turfs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The strategy rests on peer pressure, naming and shaming governments that fail to make progress.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In practice, however, peer pressure has become peer collusion.</seg>
		<seg id="19">When EU leaders met last spring to assess progress, they pitifully recognized that the Lisbon Strategy's goal was unlikely to be met.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The best that they could do now would be to dump the pretense of a strategy and carry on with the other business.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Unfortunately, the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Expect him to push on hopelessly.</seg>
		<seg id="23">One of the few good ideas contained in the Lisbon Strategy was to remove barriers to trade in services.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Intra-European competition in services is restricted by innumerable national regulations that, for instance, strictly determine the requirements for becoming a hairdresser or a plumber.</seg>
		<seg id="25">One of the defining features of the past decades is the sharp increase in services productivity in the US; none of that happened in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Guess why.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Because services account for 70% of European GDP, the potential impact from enhanced competition is substantial.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But removing protection is always politically difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The European Commission submitted a proposal in 2005 -- just as the constitution was being put up for a vote.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Not surprisingly, the proposal was quickly shelved.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Now, with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance, the battle will be firmly on the EU's agenda in 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="32">At the same time, Europe is again blocking progress in the Doha round of world trade talks, with the farmers' lobby fighting to preserve its subsidies.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Many governments are so fearful of their farmers that they see no other option than to hold their ground, no matter what.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Europe has agreed to a single trade policy.</seg>

		<seg id="40">While such a move is out of the question -- it would require a change in the European Treaty -- the noise is unhealthy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is Europe stuck?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The current team of leaders has been an enormous disappointment.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But as they fade away, there could be some light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel is obviously more positive on Europe and more pro-reform than her predecessor, but she is tied up in a grand coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In France, President Jacques Chirac, the epitome of a leader captured by his lobbies, is staggering impotently toward the end of his term in 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The two frontrunners to succeed him, Dominique de Villepin and Nicolas Sarkozy, both in government, compete on a reformist agenda, but pre-election years do not encourage bold moves.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Meanwhile, Italy must decide whether it replaces Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who displayed no interest in reform and European affairs, with the cautious Romano Prodi, the former European Commission President.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Tony Blair, once an ardent pro-European (at least by Britain's undemanding standards), might finally have to cede power to Gordon Brown, who is famously cold to European integration.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Fortunately, Britain has always been an outsider.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Taming Politicians on Both Sides of the Atlantic</seg>
		<seg id="11">Despite occasional grumbles from politicians, no one seriously doubts the European Central Bank's independence, or that monetary policy within the euro zone is therefore well insulated from political pressures.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But the recent death of the Stability and Growth Pact-killed off by Germany, its father, with France acting as co-conspirator and willing accomplice-reminds us of a key lesson: elected politicians find it hard, if not impossible, to relinquish substantial power in the area of fiscal policy.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The same is true across the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The US Federal Reserve Board is, of course, very independent.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But any attempt to limit the fiscal discretion of America's Federal government in the manner of the Stability Pact-for example, the infamous Gramm/Rudman rules of the Clinton era-always collapse in the end in the face of presidential and congressional pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Monetary policy can be used to stimulate an economy just as much as fiscal policy, if not more, in election years, which politicians will always want to do.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But reckless use of either mechanism for short-term goals may create long-term costs, justifying some restrictions on politicians' latitude in influencing macroeconomic policies.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When politicians can control inflation by exercising decisive sway over central banks, they can use their power to devalue the burden of public debt, avoiding the need for more taxation to pay it off.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This was the great lesson of the 1970's and early 1980's, when rampant inflation forced politicians to surrender this power to independent central banks, which alone could convince markets that price stability would be restored.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Yet monetary policy is not a unique species of economic policymaking.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Aspects of fiscal policy could also be delegated to independent bureaucrats in order to keep politicians in line.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Why not, for example, entrust an independent bureaucracy with some redistributive goals or control over the level of public investment or deficit management?</seg>
		<seg id="23">An independent fiscal authority could arguably implement a society's long-term goals in these areas better than politicians, who have their eyes on the next election.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is not clear why monetary policy and fiscal policy should be treated so differently, with one completely delegated to a bureaucratic agency and the other completely discretionary and in the hand of politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="25">So why do we see this large difference in reality in both America and Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="26">The answer is that fiscal policy is the key tool politicians use to attract and maintain the support of a winning coalition of voters, say retirees, public employees, and middle-class homeowners, while imposing the costs on the losers.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is not necessary to please 100% of the voters, only enough to win.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The fiscal card is critical in choosing which groups of voters to buy.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Independent fiscal authorities-or fiscal rules such as the Stability Pact-stand in the way of this political use of fiscal policy, which is costly.</seg>
		<seg id="30">After all, if politicians could not win elections by taking money from some-including future generations, which will have to foot a portion of the bill-and giving it to others, they would have to work much harder to display some ability in producing public benefits for all.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This is far more difficult!</seg>
		<seg id="32">Of course, monetary policy also has redistributive effects.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Think about the different effects of interest rates on debtors versus creditors.</seg>
		<seg id="34">However, monetary policy is a much more awkward, indirect and imprecise way of choosing winners and losers than fiscal policy.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Independent central banks can occasionally be a pain for politicians, but at least they can be used as scapegoats when necessary-a role whose political benefits outweigh the costs of losing control over a useful tool.</seg>
		<seg id="36">These considerations should guide the choice of what will follow the Stability Pact in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It is now abundantly clear that national governments (especially those of large countries) will never accept substantial limitations on their fiscal discretion.</seg>
		<seg id="38">They may have suspended their freedom of fiscal maneuver long enough to launch the euro, but in normal times, national governments will reclaim their fiscal turf.</seg>
		<seg id="39">So the European Commission should stop fighting a rearguard battle that merely weakens its credibility, especially in the eyes of small countries, which are the only ones that can be bullied into accepting unwanted fiscal rules.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Realistically, all that the Commission can ask of European national governments is for transparency and clarity in their fiscal accounts.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Preventing the political use of fiscal policy is an impossible task.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at least a country's fiscal actions should not be hidden in its budgets' obscure methodological footnotes.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Even this limited goal may not be easy to achieve.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A strategic lack of transparency is the bread and butter of shrewd politicians who want to please a lobby by hiding the costs of the public's largesse from the majority of citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The rules that govern politicians' behavior must not be written as if disinterested, well-intentioned public servants will apply them.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Politicians are willing to go to great lengths to please their supporters and win elections.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The best that we can plausibly hope for is to ensure that the worst of what they do is done out in the open.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey?</seg>
		<seg id="1">More than forty years ago, Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With the Association agreement of 1963, a special relationship was established, culminating in the customs union of 1996.</seg>
		<seg id="3">During all these years, European governments consistently confirmed Turkey's eligibility for full membership, making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled, it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU's credibility in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In many parts of Europe, however, Turkey's admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size, relatively poor economy, fears of massive immigration, and, above all, cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="9">However, they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With 80 million people, Turkey would be one of the largest EU states.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU's decision-making process, because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Because of its weak economy, Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The size of these transfers, however, would depend on the EU's financial policies at the time of admission, the outcome of accession negotiations, and economic developments in Turkey.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In any case, the EU's practice of &quot;capping&quot; its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey's accession.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Immigration should not be a cause for undue concern, either.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Human mobility is limited, and Turkey workers' would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period, possibly not before 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Given the expected upswing of Turkey's economy and its declining birthrate, experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Meanwhile, diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable, Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is Turkey's Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey's deeply rooted secularism, such a risk cannot be totally excluded.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But the same is true for any other democracy, where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Surely, the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey's democratic system, which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries.</seg>
		<seg id="29">As for the EU, it must decide whether it wants to be a closed &quot;Christian club&quot; or an open and inclusive society, drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Turkey's accession to the Union would give a powerful answer, one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The need to refute arguments against Turkey's admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned: its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans, Southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe's security; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy; and the great potential of the Turkish economy, with its young and dynamic labor force.</seg>
		<seg id="32">At the same time, the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account: the likelihood that the reform process would collapse, bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU's doorsteps.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="34">On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In Calcutta, when some younger kid came along and insisted on joining the game my friends were playing, we would let the new kid in, but only after whispering into each other's ears the words,</seg>
		<seg id="2">As a child, mastering the cruel art of</seg>
		<seg id="3">The technique of</seg>
		<seg id="4">What's true of children and adults is also true of international institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, organizations that are officially committed to involving all nations in their decision making are often controlled by small groups of powerful nations, while others merely go through the motions of participation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The World Trade Organization (WTO), supposedly run on the principle of one country one vote, actually has its agenda selected behind the stage by a small group of nations.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is now standard practice for international organizations publishing a report to involve all the &quot;stakeholders&quot; and to reflect their opinions.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So the evolving report is usually put up on a Web site and suggestions are invited from one and all--NGOs, trade unions, and other organizations of civil society.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This promotes a sense of participation, but as a friend, seasoned in such matters, informed me, the key in the end is to ignore all the comments received and to write up the report as if there were no Web site and no participation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Increasingly, free expression of opinion does not influence or restrain how government behaves.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Consider the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="12">People expressed their opinion freely--in newspapers, on television, in Internet chat rooms--concerning George Bush's planned war on Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Never before was there so much opposition to a war</seg>
		<seg id="14">Part of what happened--or, rather what didn't happen--is admirable: almost no effort was made to muzzle criticism of the government, as happens in China and scores of dictatorial countries.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But the world's great democracies--the US, India, the UK, and others--are increasingly adept at not allowing freely expressed opinions to constrain what the government does.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The current war in Iraq is perhaps the strongest proof of this.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Leaving aside the immorality of this war--and immoral it is--I wish to draw attention to this increasing ability and inclination of democracies to &quot;deal&quot; with (meaning neutralize) public opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They have embraced the</seg>
		<seg id="19">As democracies mature they become ever more practiced at managing opinion, and in many cases, at shaping opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Every time Hans Blix commented on the UN inspections of Iraq that he was conducting, members of the Bush administration would paraphrase what Blix said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The paraphrasing would subtly change Blix's comments to suit America's case for war.</seg>
		<seg id="22">By repeating the altered comments, it was hoped, mass opinion would shift in favor of the war.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Overthrowing a totalitarian regime and organizing elections may be hard, but the harder task is to go from voting to establishing a true democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For people accustomed to living in a totalitarian state, learn what participation means is not easy.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Hence the popular belief that democracies, like wine, improve with age.</seg>
		<seg id="26">While this may be true, there is a downside to maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Just as citizens in a democracy continuously learn to participate, democratic governments continuously learn how to get their way despite the participation.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is no use denying that civic participation too often serves only to legitimize a sham.</seg>
		<seg id="29">We must recognize and confront this problem to prevent established democracies from atrophying and to help new democracies become more effective.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For it is not only morally wrong to leave nations and communities feeling marginalized and without voice; it is a recipe for frustration, rage, and terrorism.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Recasting Governance in Asia</seg>
		<seg id="1">Governance--the way in which decisions that affect the public interest are made--has emerged as a key factor in determining a country's pace of development.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Successful governance brings purposeful change.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Failure is punished by unrest, disaffection, and stagnation. On April 18</seg>
		<seg id="4">Today's Asian policymakers confront a very different environment from that faced by their predecessors fifty years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Asia's population has more than doubled since 1950, with most of that growth coming in its poorest countries.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The political systems of these countries were tailored to small, static, rural populations.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Now these societies must cope not only with vast urban centers, but also with the very different talents and demands of urbanized people.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The global economy has changed dramatically, too.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Increased flows of goods, money, and knowledge around the world mean that foreign organizations and individuals become more influential, making it increasingly difficult for national governments manage their countries by themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For example, international bodies such as the WTO have changed the framework within which economic decisions are taken.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Local economic change has been equally dramatic.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In parts of Asia, living standards have skyrocketed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Foreign investment from within and outside the region has altered the structure of domestic economies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Old models of economic growth, however, such as export orientation and selective use of import restrictions that worked well for East Asia in the last century, are less feasible under today's global trade rules.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So new rules of the game are needed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most Asian countries, formal rules need to be simplified and applied more fairly.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A &quot;back to basics&quot; approach is vital in three inter-linked areas, in which national governments must take the lead: minimizing corruption, enforcing property rights, and consistent application of the rule of law.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Few countries score strongly here.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Close links between business and governments were blamed by many for the financial crisis that struck Southeast Asia in 1997.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In parts of South Asia, violent conflict and the power of vested interests threaten the rule of law.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The result of such failures is that small elites benefit while the majority suffers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">A clear structure of formal rules is the best antidote to these flaws, for they bolster the informal customs on which so much in society depends.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Most business is not conducted in courts but in meetings where trust and reputation are essential.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As the social theorist Robert Putnam has explained, &quot;social capital&quot;--the networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination for mutual benefit--is as much a determinant as it is a result of economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Empowering as many members citizens as possible is likely to instill a widespread sense of purpose into efforts to move countries forward.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Government, the private sector, and civil society all have a role to play in strengthening social capital.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But successful interactions between these sectors cannot be wished into existence, and it is essential that the role of each is clearly defined.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Many Asian governments recognize the need to define their roles more clearly.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Following the 1997 crisis, the state withdrew further from markets, acknowledging the limits to what it can achieve and the importance of allowing private enterprise to flourish.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But governments retain a role in fostering an enabling environment within which markets operate.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Monitoring rules and enforcement are important, but different ways of working--say, through public-private partnerships--are also increasingly being considered in many innovative Asian economies.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The valuable role of civil society in giving voice to communities that governments cannot reach is also recognized, but its relationship with government and business is often characterized more by conflict than cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The private sector's role in decision-making, too, often needs to be clarified--where businesses have too much influence over government, their need to operate profitable may lead to policies that favor the few over the many.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The metaphor of a game--with rules and participants--leads many to think in terms of a competition between nations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is not entirely healthy, as our interdependent world is not a zero-sum game, where one country's gain is another's loss.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Indeed, countries do not compete against each other in the way that firms do.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Trade is potentially a positive-sum game, with all countries benefiting by exploiting their areas of comparative advantage.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Good governance can enhance this positive-sum game, and ensure that companies and individuals within countries partake of the benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In another sense, however, it is valuable to think of governments as being in competition--providing a more effective service to their people than other governments.</seg>
		<seg id="40">International comparison of systems therefore plays an important role.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In this spirit, this month's UNCTAD-UNDP conference--&quot;Governance in Asia: Underpinning Competitiveness in a Global Economy&quot;--will bring together policy-makers from across Asia to discuss the governance challenges that Asia faces.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The role of government--the only actor possessing the legitimacy of a popular mandate--is fundamentally important in steering a society forward.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The private sector and civil society are, of course, increasingly important partners for governments.</seg>
		<seg id="44">How relationships among these stakeholders function will powerfully influence Asia's future development.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given Californian voters an enormous--if guilty--pleasure.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some members of the opposition in Germany would dearly love to do the same to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, though they have not (yet!</seg>
		<seg id="3">) found a film star to replace him.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio &quot;Lula&quot; da Silva, to say nothing of Mexican President Vicente Fox and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Electoral success, it appears, fades fast nowadays.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Absolutely not.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Democracy, in the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is about being able to remove those in power without violence; it is in this sense about trial and error.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But leaders must be given the chance to govern.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Indeed, they need a chance to make mistakes and to learn and recover from their errors, as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Trial and error implies the opportunity to err before we try again.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Californian voters' first mistake is thus what may be called &quot;the lure of the immediate&quot;--none too surprising in a state where instant gratification is supposedly a core value.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Indeed, democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads; today's hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow, and there are always more waiting in the wings.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In politics this can be dangerous, because it encourages basing decisions, no matter how weighty, on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Referenda are for the most part snapshots.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before votes are held, may be the exception.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a rule however, referenda measure the popularity of political leaders at a particular moment, regardless of the issue at stake.</seg>
		<seg id="21">If and when Britain votes on joining the Euro, the result will most likely tell us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and about the European Union, but little about the merits of the common currency.</seg>
		<seg id="22">So the case for representative government remains strong.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Democracy is government by debate, by taking important decisions after thorough deliberation of the kind that--at least in large countries--must be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and perhaps must do so, but as a rule they take enough time to examine issues fully.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions; hence their name.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Consider Germany, where some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats yearn to sink the Schröder government.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Clearly, the reforms proposed and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular, and there is little doubt that, a year after their re-election, the coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens would not stand much of a chance at the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But who knows what the electorate will think in three years, at the end of the government's full term in office?</seg>
		<seg id="29">By the time of the next regularly scheduled election, it could become clear that there were no real alternatives to Schröder's policies, and it could even be the case that the predicted beneficial effects of painful reforms will become apparent by then.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This is why they should commit their cruelest deeds in the first year and soften up as the next election approaches.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position.</seg>
		<seg id="35">So California has set a bad example, and Californians will probably pay a heavy price for it.</seg>
		<seg id="36">They may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago, when the popularly elected Louis Napoleon transformed himself, via a wildly popular referendum, into Napoleon III--that vote being the last the French would enjoy until the end of the Second Empire.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Californians, of course, won't be disenfranchised, but their willfulness threatens to yield a wayward and irresponsible form of state politics.</seg>
		<seg id="38">To be sure, democracy implies limiting the time that the powerful have to exercise their power without challenge.</seg>
		<seg id="39">An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legislate and to carry out their program.</seg>
		<seg id="40">These two imperatives are inherently contradictory, but the balance between them is still best achieved through representative, parliamentary democracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Herbert Hoover and the Stability Pact</seg>
		<seg id="1">In mid-July the great-and-good finance ministers of the European Monetary Union (EMU) gathered to consider the euro zone's economic condition.</seg>
		<seg id="2">They ruminated over the most recent economic forecast, which projects annual GDP growth in the euro zone this year at a pathetically anemic 0.7%.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Then, to a minister, without exception, they all but decided that their economies should suffer more of the same, if not worse.</seg>
		<seg id="4">They reiterated their commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact, which requires euro-zone countries to raise taxes and cut spending, putting even more downward pressure on their economies.</seg>

		<seg id="8">Others talk of the importance of obeying the ``rules of the game.''</seg>
		<seg id="9">Still others say that while it is clearly essential to restore economic growth, the recovery must occur ``within the spirit of the Pact.''</seg>
		<seg id="10">From the American side of the Atlantic, all of these rationales seem utterly bizarre.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The last time an American government tried to ensure a balanced budget in the face of a recession was over seventy years ago, during the presidency of Herbert Hoover at the outset of the Great Depression.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Since then the broad consensus in the US has been that cyclical economic distress requires the use of budget deficits to ameliorate suffering, stimulate aggregate demand, and hasten recovery.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists call these cyclical fiscal boosts ``automatic stabilizers.''</seg>
		<seg id="14">When private incomes fall, so do public revenues.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The reduction in tax collection can increase disposable income.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But, more importantly, when private incomes fall, government social-welfare expenditures rise, sparking a recovery in demand, output, investment, and employment.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The fall in taxes and the rise in spending do widen the budget deficit, but in a healthy and useful way.</seg>
		<seg id="18">On the American side of the Atlantic, the usefulness of these automatic fiscal stabilizers is unchallenged.</seg>
		<seg id="19">On the contrary, whenever recession threatens, political debate revolves around whether they need to be reinforced by</seg>
		<seg id="20">Nor is it even a fiscal discipline issue.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Whenever proposals have surfaced for some sort of balanced-budget amendment to the US Constitution, proponents have typically included exemptions not just for war, but also for recessions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">We know the origins of the Stability and Growth Pact.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Northern European countries--particularly Germany and the Netherlands--prided themselves on traditionally maintaining moderate debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively low interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="24">These countries saw that Southern European countries--Italy and Greece were the biggest worries--traditionally had high debt-to-GDP ratios and relatively high nominal interest rates because of their perceived tolerance of inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The Northern European countries feared that deficit spending by the South might ultimately create pressure for partial monetization of their debt through inflation of the euro--or, more precisely, their leaders feared that investors, fearing the same thing, would demand higher interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The Stability and Growth Pact was intended to keep the public debts of southern Europe low, and thus keep interest rates low by reassuring investors that national debts would never be allowed to rise high enough to generate serious inflationary pressures.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But if you look at the euro zone's economic problems today, the danger of high long-term nominal interest rates does not even rank among investors' top ten concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="28">At the very least, investors clearly do not fear that high debt will lead governments to stoke inflation by printing more money.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The EU's problems are stagnant output, high structural unemployment, weak productivity growth, the wasteful and unfair Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and the forthcoming structural adjustments from the expansion of the EU itself.</seg>
		<seg id="30">From one perspective, it is good that the euro zone's finance ministers are eager to keep their national debts low in the long term: it is a sign that the victories over inflation won in the 1970's will not be casually thrown away.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But it is dangerous to become obsessed with the past.</seg>
		<seg id="32">There is no more certain route to economic disaster than to put on historical blinders.</seg>
		<seg id="33">As Herbert Hoover could attest, when we see only the economic policy problems of a generation ago, we risk missing the hazards that lie directly in front of our eyes.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Ghosts of Economics Past</seg>
		<seg id="1">In Charles Dicken's great novel &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; the soulless businessman Ebeneezer Scrooge is tormented by a visit from the Spirit of Christmas Past.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Today, economists are similarly troubled by unwanted ghosts, as they ponder the reappearance of economic ills long thought buried and dead.</seg>
		<seg id="3">From Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley to Paul Krugman at Princeton, to the Governors of the US Federal Reserve and the senior staff at the European Central Bank, to almost everyone in Japan, economists all over the world are worrying about deflation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Their thoughts retrace the economic thinking of over fifty years ago, a time when economists concluded that the thing to do with deflation was to avoid it like the plague.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Back in 1933 Irving Fisher --Milton Friedman's predecessor atop America's monetarist school of economists-- announced that governments could prevent deep depressions by avoiding deflation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Deflation --a steady ongoing decline in prices-- gave businesses and consumers powerful incentives to cut spending and hoard cash.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It reduced the ability of businesses and banks to service their debt, and might trigger a chain of big bankruptcies that would destroy confidence in the financial system, providing further incentives to hoard.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Such strong incentives to hoard rather than spend can keep demand low and falling, and unemployment high and rising, for a much longer time than even the most laissez-faire-oriented politician or economist had ever dared contemplate.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Hence the Keynesian solution: use monetary policy (lower interest rates) and fiscal policy (expanded government spending and reduced taxes) to keep the economy from ever approaching the precipice where deflation becomes possible.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But if this is an issue solved over fifty years ago, why is it haunting us now?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why is this menace a matter of grave concern in Japan today, and a threat worth worrying about in the US?</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the late 1940s, those present at the creation of the post-World War II international economic order tried to create an international monetary system that would (a) allow for exchange rates stable enough for producers and consumers to escape the risks of excessive and irrational exchange rate fluctuations, (b) allow countries to follow their own domestic macroeconomic policies, and (c) prevent the catastrophic panics affecting not just individual banks but whole countries that produced the destructive international financial crisis of the Great Depression.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The result was the fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate system of Bretton Woods, which over time mutated into the floating-rate system of the 1980s.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then came the 1990s.</seg>
		<seg id="15">All of a sudden tremendously destructive herd-driven financial crises were back: Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Brazil, and so on looked like nothing as much as the US financial panic of 1873 or the Austrian Creditanstalt crisis of 1931.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Argentina's crisis at the end of 2001 looked remarkably like Argentina's Baring Brothers crisis of 1890 -- save that politicians and international bankers seem to have had a much better idea of what to do to minimize the damage in 1890 than they do today.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But if those who built the post-World War II international monetary system worked to guard against the dangers posed by panic-driven international financial crises, why are these financial devils back?</seg>
		<seg id="18">The truth is that economic policymakers are juggling sets of potential disasters, exchanging the one that appears most threatening for a threat that seems more distant.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In the US, the Bush Administration is skeptical of the stimulative power of monetary policy and wants bigger fiscal deficits to reduce unemployment, hoping that the future dangers posed by persistent deficits -- low investment, slow growth, loss of confidence, uncontrolled inflation and exchange rate depreciation-- can be finessed, or will not become visible until after the Bush team leaves office.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In Europe, the European Central Bank believes that the danger of uncontrolled inflation following a loss of public confidence in its commitment to low inflation outweighs the costs of European employment that is far too high.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In developing countries, capital controls to prevent financial crises are feared as obstacles to attracting the finance necessary for industrialization, and as potential sources of corruption as financial flows somehow pass through the hands of the Vice Minister of Finance's nephew-in-law.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Flexible exchange rates, designed to allow the market to signal when confidence in the currency is declining, also put exporters at a competitive disadvantage against foreign-country producers whose prices aren't batted around by unpredictable exchange rates.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Even the import-substitution policies, now universally scorned, were originally adopted by the developing world for good (as well as bad) reasons: the protectionist shutting-off of developed-country markets during the Great Depression which had disastrous consequences for the developing economies.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The ghosts of economics' past return because the lessons of the present are always oversold.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Politicians and policymakers advance their approach to economics as the &quot;One True Doctrine.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">But what they are doing, however, is dealing with the biggest problem of the moment but at the price of removing institutions and policies that policymakers before them had put into place to control problems which they felt to be the most pressing.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Ebeneezer Scrooge's nocturnal visitors were able to convince him of the errors of his ways.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Let's hope that today's economists also learn the lessons of their unwanted ghosts.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Justifying Humanitarian Intervention</seg>
		<seg id="1">In 1998, I visited Central Asia's former Soviet republics for talks--concerning the democratic development that was--or should have been--taking place in those newly independent countries.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My hosts were former communist leaders who were now more or less democratically elected presidents.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Each spoke easily about institutions, democratic procedures, and respect for the rule of law.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But human rights were another matter entirely.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In each country, I presented lists of political prisoners and asked about their fates.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In one country, the president immediately decided to free a man accused of plotting a coup.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But even this seeming success was morally ambiguous.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The president had not made a political decision; he had bestowed a personal favor.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I was receiving a gift--itself merely another demonstration of the president's arbitrary exercise of power--not proof of respect for moral principles.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In one country, I spoke with a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist opposition, which had waged a long civil war against the government.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This man now styled himself as chairman of a &quot;Committee of National Reconciliation.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Guards armed to the teeth surrounded him, yet he firmly supported the notion of democratization.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Indeed, he saw it as his surest route to power, because the vast majority of the population thought exactly as he did.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Democracy, he hinted more ominously, would enable him to &quot;eliminate&quot;--he did not dwell on the exact meaning of the word--those who did not.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In such democracies without democrats, &quot;human rights&quot; are more problematic to discuss than procedural formalities, because they are not thought of as &quot;rights&quot; in the legal sense, but merely as pangs of conscience, or else as gifts to be exchanged for something else of value.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This distinction matters because it points to the limited effectiveness of formalized legal norms as a means of promoting human rights.</seg>
		<seg id="17">This gap between human rights and the behavior of rulers has brought about the greatest shift in the conduct of international affairs in our time--the advent of &quot;humanitarian intervention.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">It arose initially outside established international institutions and the UN system, originating with the French group, Doctors Without Borders, which deemed human rights to be a value superior to national sovereignty.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Doctors Without Borders introduced the concept of &quot;the right of intervention&quot; in humanitarian disasters, bypassing the strictures of traditional international law.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The international system rather quickly adopted (and transformed) this notion, and numerous humanitarian</seg>
		<seg id="21">NATO's intervention in Kosovo is a precedent that US Secretary of State Colin Powell used to justify the war with Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But, however compelling the cause of humanitarian military intervention, such actions must be brought under the umbrella of the UN Charter.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Promoting respect for human rights was, after all, the guiding principle behind the UN's establishment.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Its tasks in this area were affirmed in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which give human rights legal supremacy over the sovereignty of individual states.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Yet a glaring contradiction exists between the universality and supremacy of human rights and the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in states' internal affairs, which are also enshrined in UN documents.</seg>
		<seg id="26">One way to overcome this chasm is to introduce into the UN Charter a new chapter devoted to human rights and to reformulate Chapter IV, which concerns the use of force in international relations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Moreover, the principle of sovereignty itself needs redefinition.</seg>
		<seg id="28">What the world needs is a system of legal injunctions--bilateral and multilateral agreements, as well as appropriate monitoring and supervisory institutions--to regulate the use of force for humanitarian reasons.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Legal restraints on humanitarian intervention are necessary because dictators too often use it to justify criminal aggression.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Adolf Hitler minted this strategy when he dismantled Czechoslovakia--supposedly in defense of the Sudeten Germans--and later when he invaded my homeland, Poland.</seg>
		<seg id="31">As Milosevic showed again in the 1990s, when he claimed to be defending innocent Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, justifying military intervention solely on the basis of moral principles leaves too much room for their distortion and abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This is why debates about reforming the Security Council should focus not on changing its composition, but on its mission.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Council should be made explicitly responsible for &quot;human security&quot; and be given a responsibility to protect it, in addition to its current role in safeguarding more traditional notions of international security.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The principle of non-intervention in a state's internal affairs was never absolute, and globalization confronts it with a radical challenge.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The term &quot;international relations&quot; assumes the Westphalian order of commitments among sovereign nation states, which replaced the medieval order of communities defined by personal fealty to a king.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But today it is the Westphalian order that is in decline, along with the significance of state borders.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In this wider and uncertain context, the need to regulate humanitarian military intervention looms large.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What Does America Want?</seg>
		<seg id="1">When the leaders of the world's richest nations gather in Evian, France, one unasked question will dominate: what does America want in the world?</seg>
		<seg id="2">So it may be helpful to outline the principles and ideas that guide US foreign policy.</seg>
		<seg id="3">First, inconsistency is no vice.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, in foreign policymaking, inconsistency is often a virtue.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I speak not of principles, but of policy.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The US does not have a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to the world.</seg>
		<seg id="7">What happened in Iraq should not be over?interpreted as a rigid template for US policy toward countries that pursue weapons of mass destruction, support terrorism, or deny people liberty.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In Iraq, the US used force as a last resort, against a country with a clear record of aggression, and after a large degree of international consensus had developed about what Iraq needed to do.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Different policies-tailored for local, regional, and international realities-will be needed to meet the challenges posed by North Korea, Iran, Syria, or elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="10">America's armed forces are an essential background to much of what the US accomplishes internationally.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But defense policy is only one component of foreign policy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Not every threat to America's national interests can be addressed with military power.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If all you have to work with is a hammer, as the saying goes, every problem looks like a nail.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Success in foreign policy, as in carpentry, requires the right tools for the job.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Partnership is essential here.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For all of America's power, there is little that the US can do in the world that it can't do better with the active participation of others, be they governments, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Partnership facilitates solutions to problems that defy purely national responses and means that burdens are shared.</seg>
		<seg id="18">America relies on partnerships in the global war on terrorism: foreign governments provide intelligence and law enforcement cooperation; trading partners ensure the security of shipping containers; private financial institutions help track the transfers of funds that sustain terror networks.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Beyond partnerships, international institutions add value-provided they are effectively organized, have realistic mandates, and contain members that are committed to common norms and aims.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Such institutions can and often do advance US national interests.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Indeed, it would be difficult to carry out critical dimensions of US foreign policy-from trade to non?proliferation to environmental policy-without them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The World Trade Organization is a case in point.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It provides a forum in which to negotiate new trade liberalization agreements, seek remedies against protectionist and discriminatory policies, and resolve disputes with trading partners.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But the US must also ensure that existing institutions are adapted to current realities.</seg>
		<seg id="25">NATO, for example, is evolving from a Cold War alliance focused solely on Europe to one suited to meeting today's security challenges wherever they may arise, such as in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Multilateralism is most successful when built on a real convergence of interests and values.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The UN and other global frameworks may sometimes be best placed to address US foreign policy goals.</seg>
		<seg id="28">When the UN or other bodies are unwilling or unable to move against dire threats, America reserves the right to act in less encompassing alliances or flexible,</seg>
		<seg id="29">This flexibility is needed because of the nature of the challenges that loom on the horizon.</seg>
		<seg id="30">We ignore failing states at our peril, because anarchy creates an environment conducive to extremist ideologies and can offer a haven for terrorists, criminals, and drug traffickers.</seg>
		<seg id="31">One of our most pressing tasks today is to prevent the implosion of weak states.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Another is to assist countries that have collapsed into violence to begin the slow process of recovery.</seg>
		<seg id="33">One impulse behind America's international engagement, and one of the great sources of its global power, has been its enduring impulse to make the world a better place.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Any US foreign policy must combine interests and values, because the American public always insists that US national objectives be linked to national ideals.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The appeal of US leadership abroad rests in part on the attractiveness of America's political institutions, society, and culture, and its willingness to champion human rights and democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">At the same time, our efforts to promote democracy worldwide serve US interests, owing to the hardheaded realization that democracies settle their differences peaceably.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Today's world lacks irreconcilable conflict among the main concentrations of world power: Europe, Russia, China, Japan, and the US.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This congruence of interest and agreement on the rules of international order offers a promising foundation for managing the common challenges that confront us all.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Our over?riding goal should be to create a world in which governments, organizations, and peoples embrace arrangements that allow them to realize their shared interests and that reflect fundamental universal values.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Everyone has an interest in a world in which force is used only as a last resort, terrorism is regarded as beyond the pale, weapons of mass destruction do not spread and are not used, free trade becomes the norm, citizens enjoy basic liberties, democratic values triumph, and the rule of law replaces the way of the gun.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Bringing such an integrated world may be optimistic, even idealistic, but it is hardly naive.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Road to the Double Helix, the Structure of DNA</seg>
		<seg id="1">Fifty years ago, on April 25, 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick published a short letter in the science magazine</seg>
		<seg id="2">A second major advance came a few months later, when Max Perutz discovered a technique to determine the structures of large molecules like myoglobin and hemoglobin.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Since then, X-ray structural analysis of protein molecules has helped us to understand the chemistry of biological reactions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Both discoveries--DNA structure and protein structure--were made at Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory.</seg>
		<seg id="5">So why were these two foundation stones of the revolution in biology and medicine that dominated science in the second half of the 20th century uncovered in a British</seg>
		<seg id="6">The great breakthroughs of 1953 rested on the strength of experimental physics at Cambridge, beginning in the late 19th century.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This legacy shaped the intellectual environment in which the father-and-son team of William and Lawrence Bragg were trained, and where Lawrence Bragg--first as an undergraduate and then as a research student--developed in 1912 the ideas that led to X-ray structural analysis.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Although Max von Laue, Walter Friedrich, and Paul Knipping had discovered the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, it was Lawrence Bragg who understood how it could be exploited scientifically.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Reflection by &quot;Bragg planes&quot;--sheets of atoms that can diffract X-rays at specific angles that are determined by the separation between sheets--enabled the Braggs to calculate the exact arrangement of sodium and chloride atoms in a crystal of salt.</seg>
		<seg id="10">William Bragg graduated in mathematics in Cambridge in 1884, and became professor of physics in Adelaide, Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In 1909 he returned to Britain to take up a chair at Leeds, continuing his work on the nature of X-rays.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He became director of the Royal Institution in London in 1923, where he attracted some outstanding young scientists interested in the X-ray field.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Among them were two recent Cambridge graduates, William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal, who became interested in the problem of protein structure--Astbury as a result of being asked by Bragg to provide X-ray diagrams of wool and silk.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Bernal moved back to Cambridge as a lecturer in structural crystallography in 1927, and in 1931 was promoted to assistant director of research in crystallography, by then a sub-department of the Cavendish Laboratory.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Bernal's main scientific interest was initially the atomic structure of crystals, metals, and minerals, then of hormones and sterols--and of some amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Astbury, meanwhile, moved to Leeds in 1928, where he also began working on amino acids and proteins.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Describing his unsuccessful attempts to obtain well-ordered X-ray diffraction patterns from crystals of the protein pepsin, he wondered whether Bernal could help obtain crystals of other proteins.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A friend of Bernal's named Glenn Millikan had happened to visit a lab in Uppsala, Sweden, where large pepsin crystals had been obtained, and he brought some of the crystals, still in their mother-liquor, back to Cambridge.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) obtained patterns of the dry crystals, as Astbury had, and with similarly disappointing results.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But when Bernal observed the crystals in a light microscope, he noticed that as the large amount of water in the crystal lattice evaporated, they became disordered.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They repeated the X-ray experiment, but with the crystal surrounded by its mother-liquor and sealed in a glass capillary, obtaining patterns with large numbers of crystalline reflections.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The results of this first defining moment in protein crystallography were published as a letter in</seg>
		<seg id="23">Max Perutz, a chemistry graduate from Vienna, arrived in Cambridge in 1935 to work as a graduate student with Bernal.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The next year, he was given excellent hemoglobin crystals and soon produced the best X-ray diffraction patterns to date.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the observable diffraction pattern--the intensities and positions of the individual reflections--represents only half of the data needed to deduce the structure of the diffracting object.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In mathematical terms, it gives the amplitude, but not the phases--i.e., the stages in an oscillatory motion--without which the atomic positions could not be determined.</seg>
		<seg id="27">With simpler structures made up of small numbers of atoms, chemistry could provide considerable guidance as to the atomic arrangements, and a solution could thus often be found by trial and error.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But proteins, which contain thousands of atoms, were far too complicated for this to work.</seg>
		<seg id="29">So despite the enormous amount of excellent data that was collected, the solution remained tantalizingly out of reach.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But the faith remained that detailed information about protein structure could be obtained from the X-ray patterns in some way, if only it could be discovered.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It was only natural that where chemistry fell short, physics--and its premier laboratory--showed the way forward, a way grasped by Watson and Crick in the epic breakthrough that we celebrate this month.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Worlds Apart</seg>
		<seg id="1">Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth, an array of factors, exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes, has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge, social responsibility, and life chances from one generation to the next.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality Predicament, few countries, rich or poor, have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality, or to its consequences for education, health, and social welfare.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Of course, there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability, threatening security.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Excluded and facing bleak life prospects, young people, in particular, often experience anomie and may turn to anti-social behavior, including violence.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Clearly, however, poverty arises from various complex conditions, and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is hard to imagine, for example, how to &quot;make poverty history&quot; without also generating enough decent work, educational opportunities, and healthcare for all.</seg>
		<seg id="10">To be sure, the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis, life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Overall, however, the inequality gaps are large and, in many cases, growing.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality, with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Meanwhile, growing unemployment, widening skill and productivity gaps, and the &quot;informalization&quot; or &quot;casualization&quot; of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide, as the number of &quot;working poor&quot; and the incidence of &quot;jobless growth&quot; has spread.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs, imposed since the 1980's, delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Growth in much of the world during the past quarter-century has been slower than in the previous 25 years, despite more rapid growth in East Asia, India, and a few other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years, largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Indeed, in much of the world, such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government, while otherwise increasing overall inequalities.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But they are exceptions: the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries, with rising unemployment, greater earnings disparities, reduced social protection, and environmental degradation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">International financial liberalization, for example, has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In addition, contrary to the promises of its proponents, financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital-poor to the capital-rich over the long term, while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Meanwhile, free-trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Developing countries' international terms of trade have worsened: prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures, as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture, and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Don't Follow The Fed</seg>
		<seg id="1">The US Federal Reserve faces a dilemma, for it needs to continue raising interest rates in the face of a hurricane-devastated economy.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Fed's failure to raise rates earlier thus holds a powerful lesson for the European Central Bank: after a prolonged period of monetary stability at unusually low interest rates, waiting too long to raise rates to more normal and appropriate levels holds dangerous consequences.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Fed was late in beginning the interest-rate normalization process, and it is now paying a price.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The ECB must not make the same mistake, even bearing in mind that the two central banks operate in different milieus and under different constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Warning signs of impending inflation abound across the euro zone.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now, indicating excess liquidity.</seg>
		<seg id="7">September headline inflation, at 2.6%, is above the ECB's 2% target ­ -- as is the latest forecast for 2006 inflation (updated forecasts will be released at the beginning of December).</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;The period of wage moderation may be coming to an end,&quot; warns Otmar Issing, the ECB's chief economist, implying that soaring energy prices may now be feeding through into the overall price level (so-called &quot;second-round effects&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="9">In these circumstances, there is no good reason to wait to raise interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The longer energy prices remain at their current lofty levels, the greater the probability that inflationary expectations will increase and that second-round effects will materialize.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Further procrastination on interest-rate normalization by the ECB could well lead to a nasty bout of inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This would be disastrous for Europe's economic recovery, as the ECB would have no choice but to slam down hard on the monetary brakes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">No one wants this.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Better a 50-basis-point increase now -- thereby allowing the economic recovery to continue by keeping inflation in check -- than triple or quadruple that figure down the road.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The old adage that &quot;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&quot; applies with particular force to monetary policy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Judging from the outcome of last month's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, that &quot;ounce of prevention&quot; appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, the pace of ECB warnings about the risks of inflation has quickened in recent months -- the earlier &quot;We are vigilant&quot; became &quot;We are particularly vigilant&quot; in September, which became &quot;Strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted&quot; in October.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Governing Council is in danger of running out of adjectives -- as well as credibility -- if it does not act soon.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The tone of ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's comments in the Q &amp;amp; A section of the press conference following the October meeting was unusually hawkish.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Trichet appeared to be calling for a pre-emptive approach when he said, &quot;We must not allow second-round effects to materialize.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">For the first time, the ECB president was willing to admit publicly that the Governing Council had discussed the pros and cons of a rate hike at the meeting.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nonetheless, current interest rates were described as &quot;still appropriate&quot; in October, signaling that the ECB has not yet reached a decision to bite the bullet.</seg>
		<seg id="23">To be sure, an unexpected slowdown in economic activity or a strong rise in the value of the euro could postpone the inevitable rate hike.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But what seems clear is that the ECB used the October press conference to warn politicians, trade unions, and the markets that its long period of monetary-policy inactivity is coming to an end.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The exit process has begun.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Not everyone is happy with this news.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Politicians -- like Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and ECOFIN (the finance ministers of the European Union's member states) -- continue to press for fixed, even lower, interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But it's easy for politicians to be irresponsible about monetary policy.</seg>
		<seg id="29">They are not the ones who will be blamed for soaring prices, nor are they the ones who will have to force the inflation genie back into the bottle.</seg>
		<seg id="30">By constantly pushing for lower interest rates than the ECB can deliver, politicians set the central bank up as a scapegoat for Europe's poor economic performance.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Europe is doing badly, they argue, not because of their own failure to lead the structural reform process, but because interest rates are too high.</seg>
		<seg id="32">At the same time, the ECB does not need to go nearly as far as the Fed, which has raised interest rates in increments of 25 basis points at 12 consecutive meetings, with still more to come.</seg>
		<seg id="33">For the ECB, an increase of 50 basis points could do the job at this point -- after which rates could probably be put on hold for some time.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The Fed waited too long to start the normalization process, and, because it was more aggressive in lowering rates in the downward phase of the interest-rate cycle, it has had to be more aggressive in raising them in the upward phase.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This is not the type of volatile monetary policy that Europe wants or needs.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Madrid bombings have made Europeans feel the scourge of terrorism in their bones.</seg>
		<seg id="2">March 11 is now Europe's version of September 11 in America.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses: Spain's response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Does this mean that Europe and the US have dramatically different visions?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Part of the seeming disconnect on foreign policy emerges from a misunderstanding about what &quot;Europe&quot; is about.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The European project is a realist's response to globalization and its challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It was initiated to create &quot;solidarités de fait,&quot; promote political stability, and consolidate democracy and Europe's social model.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Having achieved these goals, Europe now wants to make a positive contribution to world developments.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is not nostalgia for past glory.</seg>
		<seg id="10">An unprecedented degree of solidarity now exists across Europe, as was apparent in the collective mourning and outpouring of sympathy towards Spain; we must build on that huge potential to create a logic of solidarity in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The US, also victim of a horrendous attack, feels drawn to the world but not to promote a similar model of cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Rather, in defending their values and security, Americans strive to defend the world, especially the Western world, from dark new threats.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">With all the attention devoted to strained transatlantic relations, it is easy to overlook how often our preoccupations overlap.</seg>
		<seg id="15">On issues such as terrorism, weapons proliferation, Iran, Afghanistan (where we jointly train the country's future army), and Africa (where French initiatives with American support recently succeeded in stabilizing Côte d'Ivoire and Congo), Europe and the US speak with a common voice.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But on some issues, such as the Iraq war, Europeans are not all ready to follow America blindly.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The world - Europe in particular - has fascination and admiration for the US.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But today we must move away from fascination and gratitude and realize that the pursuit of European integration remains in the best interest of the US, which has supported it for 50 years.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In today's world, there is clearly work for two to bring about stability and security, and in promoting common values.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In particular, the Franco-German &quot;engine&quot; of Europe should not be seen as a potential rival to the US.</seg>
		<seg id="21">France and Germany are not an axis aspiring to be some sort of an alternative leadership to the US.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Rather, the two countries form a laboratory needed for the internal working of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Indeed, France and Germany do not get along naturally.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Much sets us apart: EU enlargement, agriculture, and domestic market issues.</seg>
		<seg id="26">So it is not the</seg>
		<seg id="27">So I do not believe that a lasting rift looms.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Most Americans still see in Europe a partner with largely the same aims in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most Europeans see in America a strong friend.</seg>
		<seg id="30">We are all allies of the US; our draft constitution restates the importance of the NATO link; our strategy for growth and our contribution to global stability depend on the irreplaceable nature of our relationship with America.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This is why the US should encourage the development of a common European security and defense policy, which is merely the burden sharing that America has been pressing on Europe for decades.</seg>
		<seg id="32">We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as just happened.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But we must also establish an autonomous European military planning capacity, because the EU might need to lead its own operations, perhaps because NATO is unwilling to.</seg>
		<seg id="34">We French are opposed to building a &quot;two-speed&quot; Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But we want structured co-operation - meaning that some European states may press ahead in defense capacity - because we are not prepared to let the more cautious and hesitant dictate a recurrence of the Balkan tragedy of the 1990's, when Europeans couldn't act and Americans wouldn't (for a while).</seg>
		<seg id="36">The creation of such a capacity will make the EU a more effective transatlantic partner.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So it is hard for Europeans to understand why plans for closer European integration should be seen as anti-American.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The only way to arrest such fears is through closer and more frequent dialogue.</seg>
		<seg id="39">On defense and security matters, the EU's security doctrine provides a great opportunity to build on our common worries: terrorism and non-proliferation, but also the need to ensure sustainable development in all quarters of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Europe and the US must pursue their aims in cooperation, while ensuring that such cooperation never becomes an alliance of the &quot;West against the Rest.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="41">Some in the West have tried to conjure a &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; out of our troubled times.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is India Ready for Full Currency Convertibility?</seg>
		<seg id="1">India's political boldness in seeking peace with Pakistan in their half-century   struggle for Kashmir may soon be matched by economic moves equally as daring.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Indeed, India is edging toward a truly bold reform: full international convertibility of the rupee.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How it goes about this will not only effect India's economic development, but provide object lessons for China as it ponders convertibility in the years ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Since 1991 India has been travelling on a path from rupee devaluation to full convertibility, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) relaxing a range of foreign-exchange controls.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Resident Indians can now maintain a foreign-currency account and invest in shares of foreign companies, while non-resident Indians can repatriate legacy/inheritance assets.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Indian companies listed abroad can buy property in foreign countries, and resident firms will be allowed to pre-pay external commercial debt up to US$100 million.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Limits on exporters' foreign-currency accounts will be removed, and banks may invest in overseas money and debt markets.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Is India ready for full convertibility?</seg>
		<seg id="9">The government is still lagging on its domestic economic reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Structural reform and privatization have slowed, eroding investors' confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But failure to address structural problems could expose the economy to external shocks in the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Hence it would be premature for India to open up its capital account immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Exchange rate stability is the key anchor when a country's reform process is underway.</seg>
		<seg id="14">There is, however, little evidence that capital account convertibility has a meaningful impact on a country's growth rate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">With capital-account convertibility, the rupee's exchange rate will be determined more by capital flows than by inflation differentials, as India's inflation rate remains broadly in line with the OECD average of around 3%.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Because India is still running a trade deficit, there could be some pressure on the rupee following any negative shock.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Although monetary growth is more than twice the rate of real GDP growth, the inflationary risk is probably low because substantial excess capacity exists.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Indeed, throughout the 1990s, despite rising output, deflation occurred, which means that India's potential output is expanding.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The moves towards full capital-account convertibility have proceeded in step with impressive growth in India's foreign-currency reserves.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Indeed, India's external liquidity position has strengthened dramatically in the past decade.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As a result of a current-account surplus and an interest-rate differential of 3-4%, foreign reserves reached $70.3 billion by the end of 2002--enough to cover almost 15 months of imports--up from only US$4 billion in 1990.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Following the 1991 balance of payments crisis, the rupee's exchange rate was devalued around 20%.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Exporters could exchange 30% of their earnings at the market rate.</seg>
		<seg id="24">This was subsequently replaced with a two-tier exchange-rate system making the rupee partially convertible--60% of export earnings could be converted at the market exchange rate, and the rest at the RBI's fixed rate (used by the government to finance essential imports like petroleum, cooking oil, fertilizers, and life-saving drugs).</seg>
		<seg id="25">The two-tier exchange-rate system acted as an export tax, but it did not survive for long, giving way to a unified exchange rate on the trade account.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Full convertibility on the current account followed in August 1994.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The policy debate then turned to capital-account convertibility, with the IMF and the World Bank strongly in favor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In May 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility charted a three-stage liberalization process to be completed by 1999-2000, with an accompanying emphasis on fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target, and a strong financial system.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Then the East Asian currency crisis put further action on hold and raised serious questions about when--and whether--to proceed.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The sudden meltdown of apparently healthy economies served as a stark reminder that strong external liquidity should not be the driving force towards full convertibility.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The downside risk of capital-account liberalization, after all, is higher exchange-rate volatility, and even countries with sound liquidity positions could not prevent a run on their reserves.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The lesson for India is that, in the event of a domestic or external shock, full convertibility could prove to be a costly, short-lived experiment.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The fundamental question is whether full convertibility will encourage higher net inflows or outflows of capital.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The downside risk of higher volatility for the rupee is aggravated by some serious problems, including a deficit running at 6% of GDP and the strategic stand-off with Pakistan.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Short-term capital outflows--which might occur should either risk worsen--could create greater output volatility.</seg>
		<seg id="36">So it is vital for India to increase the inward flow of long-term capital, regardless of whether the capital account is closed or open.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In this context, it is noteworthy that China, with a closed capital account, has foreign-exchange reserves of US$286 billion, four times the size of India's, though China's economy is only double India's size.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Nor is full convertibility the key to attracting higher inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).</seg>
		<seg id="39">China attracted FDI inflows of US$52.7 billion in 2002--the largest in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="40">India needs to attract higher FDI inflows to help soak up the economy's excess capacity.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This underscores the importance for India's financial stability of successful management of the capital account (monitoring inflows and outflows) following any move toward full convertibility.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But, in the near term, full capital account convertibility is not in India's interest.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Great Man Syndrome</seg>
		<seg id="1">In our globalized age, vast impersonal forces are supposed to determine events.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Globalized markets, unfettered trade, militant Islam, China's awakening: these are the things historians and strategists usually portray as the key forces shaping our destiny.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But most people don't see things this way.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Instead, most people still instinctively look at &quot;great men&quot; as the agents of history, the men (and women) who seem to forge events through their political vision, personal charisma, and the force of their moral claims.</seg>
		<seg id="5">By sheer force of conviction and personality, such figures, many of us believe, can carry the day, bringing a glimmer of hope to an otherwise detached and impersonal universe.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This yearning for providential men or women in our global age results from at least three factors.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The second, paradoxically, reflects our growing cynicism towards politics and politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And the third is the result of our media culture, obsessed as it is with putting a &quot;face&quot; to events.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Confronted with the problem of bringing about positive changes in a domestic or international environment that seems to defy the power of &quot;normal&quot; leaders, one looks for new Alexanders to untie the &quot;Gordian knot&quot; and transcend complexity by sheer force of will and dynamism.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For example, structural reforms in Europe are thought impossible to enact unless imposed by some reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the Middle East, everyone waits for a new Anwar Sadat to arise among the Arabs.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Disillusion with politics and politicians also is a key element of our yearning for providential leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In France for example, the overly flattering commemoration of President François Mitterrand's death ten years ago primarily reflects widespread disillusion with his successor, Jacques Chirac.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Indirect criticism of the present is usually a key element in idealized views of the past.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The less we expect from a &quot;normal&quot; politician, the more we look for a hero.</seg>
		<seg id="17">With the world becoming a global stage, the media's role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The public demands quick answers to complex problems that, unsolved, risk endangering the planet.</seg>
		<seg id="19">They need figures with whom they can identify, immediately recognize, and, above all, trust.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The emergence of an embryonic &quot;world civil society&quot; heightens demand for universal and charismatic figures, holding out the hope of global accountability, but also carrying populist overtones.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In a world searching for providential leaders, the case of Ariel Sharon is both symbolic and paradoxical, for this universal man remains one of the most controversial figures of recent decades.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He has become a nearly revered figure in his country, and large segments of Western public opinion believe that his political demise represents a potentially fatal blow to any hope of progress in the region, even as he remains hated in large parts of the Arab and Muslim world.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sharon's transformation from villain to hero within the space of a mere few years is a source of fascination for his people, the region, and the world -- all the more so because his ultimate intentions will remain a subject of endless dispute among historians tomorrow and among politicians claiming to be his faithful heirs today.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Was Sharon really convinced by demographers that the &quot;Great Israel&quot; that once seemed to be his dream would actually mean the end of a Jewish State, or did his disengagement strategy of &quot;Gaza first&quot; really mean &quot;Gaza last&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="25">For those who support one or the other reading, Sharon will forever hold the benefit of the doubt.</seg>
		<seg id="26">That Sharon's stroke could be compared -- in terms of political consequences -- with the assassination of Yitzak Rabin demonstrates that his personality had become associated with hope and security.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The &quot;bulldozer&quot; had become the grandfather of most Israelis and the last card of Western diplomacy, for Americans and, surprisingly, for Europeans, too.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In fact, one may wonder if the world has made of Sharon a providential man because it wanted so much to believe that there was still &quot;hope around the corner&quot; in the Middle East.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Was this wishful thinking or self-fulfilling prophecy?</seg>
		<seg id="31">We will never know.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What is certain is that the vacuum left by Sharon's departure from politics is all the more striking in view of the images of chaos emerging from the Gaza that Israel has vacated, and the collapse of the Palestinian authority before our eyes.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Nor will the emergence of another providential figure come easily.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Not all exceptional periods create their Bonapartes, and this is probably a good thing, for exceptional leaders may give the illusion that all problems have solutions, which is far from true.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The natural course of history in the most optimistic sense is progress &quot;at the margin,&quot; but the rapid pace of technological change is pushing us to expect equally rapid progress in human affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Many of us believe that such an impossible wager can be fulfilled only by a providential man, with all the hopes -- and dangers -- that this entails.</seg>

		<seg id="41">Whatever hope exists that they can be persuaded to withdraw support or sanctuary from terrorists rests on the certainty and effectiveness with which they are confronted.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The chronic failure of the Security Council to enforce its own resolutions (with respect to Iraq) is unmistakable: it is simply not up to the task.</seg>

		<seg id="0">After Neoliberalism, What?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Latin America, the region that tried hardest to implement the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; recipes--free trade, price deregulation, and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth, with widening inequalities.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In Sub-Saharan Africa, most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism.</seg>
		<seg id="6">China, Vietnam, India: all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook, even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development, without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint, supposedly right for all countries at all times.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term, and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work.</seg>
		<seg id="12">An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks: encourage investment in non-traditional areas, and weed out projects and investments that fail.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For this, governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering, for example, that cut flowers, or soccer balls, or computer software can be produced at low cost, because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The entrepreneur who makes the initial &quot;discovery&quot; can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In turn, the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the fiscal system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector, and the underlying political economy.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Time-bound subsidy schemes, public venture funds, and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented, but there are many others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">No single instrument will work everywhere.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The job can be done, but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks:</seg>
		<seg id="25">Market-creating institutions (for property rights and contract enforcement);</seg>
		<seg id="26">Market-regulating institutions (for externalities, economies of scale, and information about companies);</seg>
		<seg id="27">Market-stabilizing institutions (for monetary and fiscal management);</seg>
		<seg id="28">Market-legitimizing institutions (for social protection and insurance).</seg>
		<seg id="29">Building and solidifying these institutions, however, takes time.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A key point here is that institutional arrangements are, by necessity, country-specific.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation.</seg>
		<seg id="33">After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies.</seg>
		<seg id="36">It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In fact, we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the &quot;menu&quot; of possible institutional arrangements in each area.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy.</seg>
		<seg id="44">In both cases, it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Other Central Europe</seg>
		<seg id="1">A specter is haunting Central Europe as its countries prepare for EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="2">That promising development is being endangered by a fevered electoral nationalism which seeks to gain votes by promising to reopen old wounds and settle old scores.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The clearest case of this comes from Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban demanded an abrogation of President Edvard Benes' decrees of 1945 (which confiscated the assets of and stripped citizenship from the German and Hungarian populations deported from Czechoslovakia at that time) as part of a re-election campaign that failed narrowly.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But Orban is not alone in seeing electoral advantage in summoning the memories of old ghosts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Orban argued that revoking the &quot;Benes decrees&quot; must be made a condition for the Czech Republic (as well as Slovakia) joining the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The ill will Orban's gambit inspired brought to a halt much of the regional cooperation of the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In its place, an ugly new form of national populism is emerging across the plain that extends between Bavaria and the Danube.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The chain reaction of reawakening nationalisms is altering the political landscape in dangerous ways.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Since the election that brought the coalition of Wolfgang Schüssel's and Jorg Haider's parties to power in Vienna, Austria's relations with the neighboring Czech Republic have deteriorated over two issues: a demand that the Czechs shutdown the Temelin nuclear power plant on the Austrian border, and revoke the Benes decrees in which Sudeten Germans were deported from Czechoslovakia and settled massively in Bavaria but also in Austria.</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the nuclear plant issue was resolved, populist pressure was forced into a single channel, the demand to abrogate the Benes decrees.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman quickly demonstrated that he, too, could play a demagogic nationalist card.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He described the Sudeten Germans as Hitler's &quot;Fifth Column&quot; and suggested that Israel could solve its Palestinian problem through resort to the Czech method of 1945: deportation.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Edmund Stoiber, Bavaria's leader, the conservative CDU/CSU candidate for German chancellor against current Chancellor Schroeder, and a staunch advocate of the Sudeten Germans, demanded that Schroeder cancel a scheduled visit to Prague in response to Zeman's outburst.</seg>
		<seg id="14">To defuse an electoral fight with his rival, Schroeder agreed.</seg>
		<seg id="15">That Orban seconded Stoiber's demands came as something of a gift from god to the Slovak nationalist Vladimir Meciar in his bid to become Prime Minister once more, as it allowed him to argue that his domestic opponents were preparing to surrender to EU pressure and force Slovakia to compensate the Hungarians expelled by Benes in 1945.</seg>
		<seg id="16">So Meciar pounced, denouncing the &quot;Hungarian menace,&quot; undoing in a stroke four years of hard work by Slovakia's current government to integrate representatives of the ethnic Hungarian minority into Slovakia's government.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Questions about postwar Europe's juridical order go beyond the former Czechoslovakia.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Erika Steinbach, President of the Association of Deportees (from the East) and a member of Stoiber's CDU, argues that the issue of the deportation of German populations is one faced by Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Slovenes, thus taking in most of East/Central Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In the 1930s, the pet hate of some Central European countries was &quot;the Versailles Order.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">Today, it appears that the Potsdam declarations of 1945, which sanctioned the mass eviction of German populations, are the new enemy.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The worry now is that such demagoguery may incite a cycle of populist victories.</seg>
		<seg id="22">That worry was dented when Viktor Orban's Fidesz party lost in Hungary's recent parliamentary elections, but other politicians happy to demagogue national resentments - Vaclav Klaus in Prague, Edmund Stoiber in Germany, Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia - still see nationalism as an electoral plus despite Orban's defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Linked to EU skeptics like Italy's Berlusconi and Austria's Schüssel-Haider coalition, the very nature of European politics may turn decidedly nasty.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Since its inception, the EU has sought to reach beyond past grief and, through cooperation, to build a better future.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Today, some politicians want to capitalize on Eastern Europe's desire to be part of Europe to reopen historical issues to their political advantage.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Two savage consequences are foreseeable: first, that there is no better way to turn parts of public opinion in the candidate countries against the EU than by allowing local populists to portray the Union as an agent of spreading German power.</seg>
		<seg id="27">An extended EU should represent a means to balance the asymmetrical relationship between Eastern Europe's small countries with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="28">There's a chance that it would be perceived as a pointer to this asymmetry.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The second worry is that, as NATO and the EU expand, these ugly debates will infect relations within these international bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fear about this may be one reason why President Bush refused to meet Prime Minister Orban recently, and there are frequent suggestions that, had Orban spoken as he now does before Hungary joined NATO, his country's application would have been rejected.</seg>
		<seg id="31">What can halt this?</seg>
		<seg id="32">After 1945, Western Europe undertook painful debates about history, and these helped bring about Franco-German reconciliation.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Notions about &quot;collective guilt&quot; were put aside as having no place in a united and uniting Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="34">So President Vaclav Havel courageously argued during his first trip to Germany in January 1990, but his comments were mistaken for weakness.</seg>
		<seg id="35">As EU expansion looms, Europe's mission must not become undermined by the advocates of that old and &quot;other&quot; Central Europe, politicians who prefer to wallow in the past rather than think in responsible ways about building a peaceful and prosperous Europe.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Remembering and Forgetting Zhao Ziyang</seg>
		<seg id="1">So, at last former Chinese Premier and Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has died.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the political agenda that he espoused while in office passed away long ago, on May 19, 1989, when he appeared in Tiananmen Square just before dawn to beg tearfully for the forgiveness of protesters.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;I am very sorry,&quot; he said to startled onlookers.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;I have come too late.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">After that, he existed more as an historical chimera than as a real person.</seg>
		<seg id="6">When his bizarre and unscheduled appearance in the square was broadcast on Central Chinese Television the next morning -- during one of the last days of uncensored media coverage -- people across China were stunned by this fleeting moment of all-too-human, official anguish.</seg>
		<seg id="7">After all, Party leaders rarely evince their personal feelings in public, much less transgress the Party line as brazenly as Zhao did.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Such individualism fit neither Leninist nor traditional Chinese proscriptions for behavior by a high official.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As the crackdown following those heady weeks of free expression and assembly came to its apocalyptic end on the night of June 3-4, Zhao vanished, sucked down the Party's memory hole into which so many other leaders have vanished since China's &quot;socialist liberation.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">To the discredit of the democratic world, hardly any head of state remonstrated on Zhao's behalf, minimally demanding that some accounting be made for his illegal and immoral incarceration.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Instead, Zhao was allowed to remain in suspended animation, under house arrest, conveniently forgotten like some cryogenically frozen celebrity with no hope of resurrection.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Zhao was not killed, but allowed to live in an old Beijing courtyard house with his family.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He was let out from time to time, but under guard like a zoo animal, to go to some spa or to play solitary holes of golf, one of the many manifestations of &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot; that his reform efforts allowed to leak through China's once hermetic seal.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process.</seg>
		<seg id="15">During the winter of 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai (viewed as a relative liberal in the Maoist hierarchy) died, tens of thousands of people spontaneously flooded Tiananmen Square, giving the Party a tremendous fright.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It was, of course, the death of former Party chief Hu Yaobang, a liberal like Zhao, which set off the protests in 1989.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Whether Zhao's supporters will express themselves in a similar fashion is uncertain.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The events of 1989 remain so sensitive, and Tiananmen Square so securely guarded, that it is hard to imagine a protest happening there soon.</seg>
		<seg id="19">At the same time, China seems so drugged on business nowadays that it is hard to imagine many people marching for a cause that would do nothing for their bottom line.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It's almost as if the Communist Party had turned Marx on his head, replacing religion with profit as the new &quot;opium of the masses.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">Few outside of the lumpen classes of unemployed workers and dispossessed peasants seem to have any gusto for political protest.</seg>
		<seg id="22">By contrast, Zhao embodied a chapter in Chinese history when to be a reformer meant to take on not only the economy, but every aspect of life.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Before becoming Premier and Party chief, he experimented with everything from the de-collectivization of agriculture and separation of the Party from business to laws guaranteeing the rights of journalists and greater openness toward the outside world for ordinary people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad, as well as the first to hold an open press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although Zhao was no visionary, no Vaclav Havel or Lech Walesa, and not even anti-communist, his agenda in the mid-1980's embraced the economy, politics, culture, media, and society, and it led to one of the most open and intellectually rich periods of Chinese history.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It was a tragic paradox that the political movement that so peacefully swept China in 1989 ended up arresting the process of broad-based, evolutionary reform to which Zhao consecrated his life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">So chastened by the trauma of June 4 was the Party leadership that, for several years afterwards, it was unclear if any reform would survive.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Then, in 1992, Deng Xiaoping set in motion one of the most rapid and total marketizations of a society in history, catalyzing China's spectacular rise as an economic superpower.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Zhao Ziyang's death reminds us not only of how unjustly he was treated, but of how lopsided China's reforms have been.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For China's &quot;miracle&quot; to truly become miraculous, Party leaders could do worse than study the record of a man whose legacy they now seem eager to push into oblivion.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Real Risks of Deficits</seg>
		<seg id="1">Deficits are back--with a vengeance.</seg>
		<seg id="2">America's government budget deficit now stands at $455 billion, 4.1% of GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Two years ago, the US predicted budget surpluses as far as the eye could see.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Although marginally less bloated than the US deficit, other rich countries are drowning in red ink.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The European Commission predicts that the French government deficit will reach 3.7% of GDP this year, with Germany's widening to 3.4%--both figures well beyond the deficit cap (3% of GDP) set by the Euro-zone's Stability and Growth Pact.</seg>
		<seg id="6">By running a deficit, a country increases its national debt and imposes burdens on future generations.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Politicians naturally prefer to hide how wealth is shifted between generations.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Their priority is paying for immediate problems, and for today's promised benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The accountants who compute government deficits try to keep politicians from fooling us into accepting the benefits they offer without understanding something of the future cost.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But what these accountants do not provide is a way to judge when deficits are justifiable and when they are not.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Deficits raise not only immediate political issues, but also issues of distributive justice between generations, and of intergenerational risk sharing.</seg>
		<seg id="12">No generation should be forced to accept unnecessary economic risks imposed by another generation.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Whether or not deficits treat future generations properly depends on how a government's systems for taxation and expenditure are designed.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Those who advocate running deficits often portray them as necessary to fix an economy in which confidence is draining away.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Following Keynes, they argue that running deficits will restore confidence before a recession or depression can take hold.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is like putting a patient on Prozac before he becomes suicidal.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But such arguments, although valid at times, have their limits.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Japan's public deficits spawned a national debt of 140% of annual GDP, without producing any economic resurgence.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Indeed, today's budget deficits reflect long-term problems that are not what Keynesian theory envisions.</seg>
		<seg id="20">So discussions about deficits should be recast in terms of the really long-term intergenerational issues that matter.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The issues are subtle, because they hinge on what future governments may do.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the past, some governments, when faced with large national debts, effectively ``inflated them away.''</seg>
		<seg id="23">They thus shifted the debt burden away from the next generation and onto investors who did not bail out of the bond market at the first sign of rising prices, or who postponed buying a house when inflation would have wiped out the real value of their mortgage debt.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Governments could decide to act this way again, especially if national debts grow bigger.</seg>
		<seg id="25">A resurgence of substantial inflation may seem unthinkable in today's environment, but remember that even a relatively modest 6% annual inflation rate cuts the real value of a nation's debt in half in just 11 years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Continued public opposition to a gradual increase in inflation is not guaranteed.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some future politicians may succeed again in planting the idea that inflation, being stimulative, is good for the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But in addition to today's officially measured government deficits, there are also other looming obligations caused by a demographic change (declining birth rates) and the prospect of huge social-welfare payments in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The scale of these obligations is monumental.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In their 2003 report, the Trustees of the US Social Security Administration Trust Funds estimate that maintaining the Social Security System's solvency for the next 75 years will require an amount whose present value is $3.5 trillion, nearly equal to today's total US government debt ($3.9 trillion).</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Trustees of the US Medicare Trust Funds (providing medical services to the retired) estimate that their unfunded obligations have a present value of $5.9 trillion--50% larger than America's official publicly-held national debt.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The potential for budgetary shortfall with social security and health care is even worse in Europe and Japan, due to their more troublesome demographics.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Moreover, unlike official national debt, social-welfare obligations are not fixed in currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Instead, they are promises of a certain standard of living (including the value of medical services), corrected for inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="35">No government can thus ``inflate them away.''</seg>
		<seg id="36">But this does not mean that pensions and other welfare obligations are entirely fixed.</seg>
		<seg id="37">What it does mean is that the problem is political.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Pensioners are among the most powerful lobbies in a democracy, and politicians are loath to confront them on so fundamental an issue.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Still, we need to face squarely the intergenerational issues at the core of today's economic dilemmas.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Our pension systems and our national budgets must be based on a ``generational accounting'' that assures that economic risk is spread systematically across generations.</seg>
		<seg id="41">What this means is that pension and tax institutions must be designed to take better account of the changing circumstances facing different generations, rather than make fixed promises--which most likely cannot be kept, anyway--of a certain payout in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="42">For example, when demographic trends or persistent economic hardships impose undue social-welfare burdens on working people, benefits to pensioners should be automatically modified by raising the retirement age and/or adjusting benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Such adjustments will probably happen anyway in the coming decades, but only after a long lag and with many inequities in the process.</seg>
		<seg id="44">What we need is the right system from the beginning, so that we can rationally manage risks that span several generations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Can these issues be addressed now, when the economic slowdown in most advanced countries makes most politicians focus on short-term fixes?</seg>
		<seg id="46">Hard times, like the Great Depression, have been occasions for fundamental changes.</seg>
		<seg id="47">With proper leadership (which unfortunately seems in short supply), today's milder hardships could provide an opportunity for public discussion of better ways of intergenerational risk sharing.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Just Say No to Bush</seg>
		<seg id="1">For three years, America's president has pursued a unilateralist agenda, ignoring all evidence that contradicts his positions, and putting aside basic and longstanding American principles.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Take global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Here Bush is conspicuously absent without leave (AWOL in military jargon).</seg>
		<seg id="4">Time and again, he questions the scientific evidence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">(Of course, Bush's academic credentials were never very impressive.)</seg>
		<seg id="6">Bush's position is more than wrong; it is an embarrassment.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indeed, when asked by Bush to look into the matter, America's National Academy of Sciences came to a resounding verdict (the only one they could honestly reach) that greenhouse gases are a menace.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But America's automakers love their gas-guzzlers, and Bush's oil industry pals want no interference with their destruction of the planet's atmosphere.</seg>
		<seg id="9">So no change in policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In Iraq, Bush again pursued a unilateralist agenda, saying that there was incontrovertible evidence of a link with Al Queda, and that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Even before the invasion, there was overwhelming evidence that Bush was lying.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Detection technology made it clear that Iraq did not have nuclear weapons, as chief UN inspector Hans Blix pointed out.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It's possible that Bush read those reports, but that they were beyond his comprehension.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is also possible that he did not believe what he read.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Whatever the case, American policy was not based on evidence.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Since the Cold War's end, America is the world's sole superpower.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Yet it has failed to exercise the kind of leadership needed to create a new world order based on principles like fairness.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Europe and the rest of the world are aware of this; but they don't vote in American elections.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Even so, the rest of the world is not powerless.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, the rest of the world should</seg>
		<seg id="21">America has not won the hearts and minds of those in Iraq; indeed, it has lost them, just as it has lost the hearts and minds of much of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The US wants to retain control of the occupation, but it wants others to receive the bullets now mowing down American soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="23">UN soldiers should not bear the consequence of America's failure to manage the occupation, so US cries for financial help should fall on deaf ears.</seg>
		<seg id="24">What sympathy does the US agenda deserve, when President Bush has ladled out tax cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest people in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It was not long ago that a Republican Congress held up $1 billion of UN dues, and threatened that it would only pay what it owed if the UN satisfied a raft of conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="26">America's unwillingness to provide small sums to wage peace contrasts sharply with the huge amounts Congress quickly granted to wage war.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Advocates of a softer approach say that if the UN stays on the sidelines, it will become irrelevant; by participating in Iraq, it will build trust with America, so that the next time a dispute such as this arises, America will turn earlier to the UN.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Nonsense.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Those in the White House today believe in</seg>
		<seg id="30">I normally write about economics, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But in the new world of globalization, there is greater economic interdependence, which requires more collective action, rules and institutions, and an international rule of law.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Economic globalization has, however, outpaced political globalization; the processes for decision making are far from democratic, or even transparent.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In no small measure, the failures of globalization can be traced to the same mindset that led to the failures in Iraq: multilateral institutions must serve not just one country's interest, but all countries'.</seg>
		<seg id="34">At the recent World Trade Organization (WTO) meeting in Cancun, the developing countries put America--and Europe--on notice that this system can no longer continue.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In that case, Europe was as much the culprit as America.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Europe has no trouble seeing the dangers of unilateralism in America's actions, in everything from abandoning Kyoto to its refusal to join the International Criminal Court.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But Europe should also reflect on its own practices, including trade policy, where the EU works systematically to unbalance the global trade regime against developing countries, despite promising that those imbalances would be corrected in the current round of trade negotiations.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Here, Europe acts like America, which has long talked the rhetoric of free trade, while its actions have long ignored the principles.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The True Costs of the Iraq War</seg>
		<seg id="1">The most important things in life ­ like life itself ­ are priceless.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But that doesn't mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Shortly before the current Iraq war, when Bush administration economist Larry Lindsey suggested that the costs might range between $100 and $200 billion, other officials quickly demurred.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For example, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels put the number at $60 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It now appears that Lindsey's numbers were a gross underestimate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Concerned that the Bush administration might be misleading everyone about the Iraq war's costs, just as it had about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaida, I teamed up with Linda Bilmes, a budget expert at Harvard, to examine the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Even we, as opponents of the war, were staggered by what we found, with conservative to moderate estimates ranging from slightly less than a trillion dollars to more than $2 trillion.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Our analysis starts with the $500 billion that the Congressional Budget Office openly talks about, which is still ten times higher than what the administration said the war would cost.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Its estimate falls so far short because the reported numbers do not even include the full budgetary costs to the government.</seg>
		<seg id="10">And the budgetary costs are but a fraction of the costs to the economy as a whole.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For example, the Bush administration has been doing everything it can to hide the huge number of returning veterans who are severely wounded -- 16,000 so far, including roughly 20% with serious brain and head injuries.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nor does the administration want to face up to the military's recruiting and retention problems.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The result is large re-enlistment bonuses, improved benefits, and higher recruiting costs -- up 20% just from 2003 to 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Moreover, the war is extremely wearing on equipment, some of which will have to be replaced.</seg>
		<seg id="16">These budgetary costs (exclusive of interest) amount to $652 billion in our conservative estimate and $799 billion in our moderate estimate.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Arguably, since the government has not reined in other expenditures or increased taxes, the expenditures have been debt financed, and the interest costs on this debt add another $98 billion (conservative) to $385 billion (moderate) to the budgetary costs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Of course, the brunt of the costs of injury and death is borne by soldiers and their families.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But the military pays disability benefits that are markedly lower than the value of lost earnings.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Similarly, payments for those who are killed amount to only $500,000, which is far less than standard estimates of the lifetime economic cost of a death, sometimes referred to as the statistical value of a life ($6.1 to $6.5 million).</seg>
		<seg id="21">But the costs don't stop there.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The Bush administration once claimed that the Iraq war would be good for the economy, with one spokesperson even suggesting that it was the best way to ensure low oil prices.</seg>
		<seg id="23">As in so many other ways, things have turned out differently: the oil companies are the big winners, while the American and global economies are losers.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Being extremely conservative, we estimate the overall effect on the economy if only $5 or $10 of the increase is attributed to the war.</seg>
		<seg id="25">At the same time, money spent on the war could have been spent elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="26">We estimate that if a proportion of that money had been allocated to domestic investment in roads, schools, and research, the American economy would have been stimulated more in the short run, and its growth would have been enhanced in the long run.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are a number of other costs, some potentially quite large, although quantifying them is problematic.</seg>
		<seg id="28">For instance, Americans pay some $300 billion annually for the &quot;option value&quot; of military preparedness -- being able to fight wherever needed.</seg>
		<seg id="29">That Americans are willing to pay this suggests that the option value exceeds the costs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But there is little doubt that the option value has been greatly impaired and will likely remain so for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In short, even our &quot;moderate&quot; estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America's involvement in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And our estimate does not include any of the costs implied by the enormous loss of life and property in Iraq itself.</seg>
		<seg id="33">We do not attempt to explain whether the American people were deliberately misled regarding the war's costs, or whether the Bush administration's gross underestimate should be attributed to incompetence, as it vehemently argues is true in the case of weapons of mass destruction.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Nor do we attempt to assess whether there were more cost-effective ways of waging the war.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Recent evidence that deaths and injuries would have been greatly reduced had better body armor been provided to troops suggests how short-run frugality can lead to long-run costs.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Certainly, when a war's timing is a matter of choice, as in this case, inadequate preparation is even less justifiable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But such considerations appear to be beyond the Bush administration's reckoning.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Elaborate cost-benefit analyses of major projects have been standard practice in the defense department and elsewhere in government for almost a half-century.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The Iraq war was an immense &quot;project,&quot; yet it now appears that the analysis of its benefits was greatly flawed and that of its costs virtually absent.</seg>
		<seg id="40">One cannot help but wonder: were there alternative ways of spending a fraction of the war's $1-$2 trillion in costs that would have better strengthened security, boosted prosperity, and promoted democracy?</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is Freedom Enough?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Do democracies need values?</seg>
		<seg id="2">The question seems absurd in the light of photographs of American soldiers torturing and humiliating Iraqi prisoners.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But the fact is that the advance of democracy historically entailed the erosion of shared values and the rise of individual autonomy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It presupposed moral agnosticism and a plurality of meanings, none of which are sacred or compulsory to all.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Democracy does nurture some common values, but they are overwhelmingly liberal values - in other words, individual rights trump collective obligations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For contemporary democrats, the fullest possible respect for the autonomous individual is, as Thomas Jefferson put it, &quot;self-evident.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">But are civil, political, and human rights enough to ensure the strength and survival of democracies?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Are today's democracies virtuous enough to rally the energies - including self-sacrifice - needed to defeat their enemies?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Such questions were never so urgent in the past, partly because fundamental democratic values were less abstract than they seem nowadays.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Such values animated the fight against Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism, fascism, and military dictatorship; in their name, decolonization was achieved, and minorities gained equality and dignity.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Democracy's values may be one-sided on behalf of individual rights, but this has also made them universal, legitimizing the struggle against oppression, wherever it is played out.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But in the world's most advanced countries, the promise of material prosperity that freedom made possible has long since replaced attention to and defense of fundamental democratic values as the cement of society.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Western citizens do not rush to emulate the freedom fighters who built their world, despite celebrations, memorials, and the persistence of oppression.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States allegedly changed everything - not only international relations, but the balance between rights and obligations that we long took for granted.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In fact, the attacks, while surprising in their method, symbolic character, and scope, changed nothing.</seg>
		<seg id="16">By themselves, they merely revealed the urgency of a fundamental reappraisal that has long been necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="17">What is the Western model of democratic development really worth?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Some non-democratic systems seem to evoke deeper support, because they are based on religious or national communal solidarity, and because closed societies minimize doubt, drift, and criticism.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity, do we have a specific civilization to defend?</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ours is a civilization that accepts selfishness towards one's own family and group; that tolerates, with few exceptions, autonomy in moral matters; and that considers blasphemy, criticism of authority, and even civil disobedience fundamental freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Our civilization, despite its drugs, prostitution, alcoholism, incivility, and vandalism, will always be better than rule by Mullahs or soldiers, because its social problems can be allayed, if never entirely eliminated, without changing the foundations of the regime.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This is not true of totalitarian or fundamentalist regimes, because, to foster free societies, they must be deposed.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But if our civilization is worth defending, why is it that fundamentalists, of whatever stripe, have the most committed fighters on their side?</seg>
		<seg id="24">Can we oppose them with anything but individual rights?</seg>
		<seg id="25">Two opposite temptations must be resisted.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The first temptation, characteristic of frightened societies, is a rush to embrace so-called &quot;traditional&quot; values, with their implications of withdrawal, closure, intolerance, and even hatred.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The second temptation is a purely military policy that fixates on physical strength without considering how to project greater credibility and fairness.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Of course, when enemies are already attacking, one cannot afford to ask too many questions.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But when enemies are merely threatening, it is better first to assert legitimacy, and thus acquire some credibility at home and abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To do so, there cannot be too wide a gap between our stated principles and our actual behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nor can we claim, as we used to, that our values spring from God, nature, reason, or historical laws.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Our values reflect the democratic debate itself, nothing more, and our defense of them must address three related fields.</seg>
		<seg id="33">First, we must update our social contract.</seg>
		<seg id="34">France's ongoing public debate about secularism and legislation is an important effort in this direction, even if the debate could be better organized to demonstrate the link between principles, social and anthropological facts, and public policy.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Such a debate should also involve education - its rules, objectives, and contents.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In many countries, however, political parties find it difficult even to contemplate such debates.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The second axis of values concerns social justice and the environment.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Issues linked to inequality, the distribution of wealth, and our exploitation of the natural world will become increasingly salient.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This debate has not happened in the US, despite vague attempts at the beginning of the first Clinton administration; it has barely begun with Tony Blair's &quot;Third Way&quot; in the UK, or with Gerhard Schröder's variant in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In France, the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts, deep division within the Left, and the Right's absence of an economic and social vision.</seg>
		<seg id="41">What remains are the values linked to the global order, defense of which requires leading by example, not by narrow, legalistic initiatives aimed at crisis management or conflict resolution.</seg>
		<seg id="42">This approach too often sacrifices long-term essential objectives to short-term concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The fight for democracy cannot be selective.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A desirable vision for the future of humanity must appeal to universally shared conceptions of justice and equity.</seg>
		<seg id="45">We must all become freedom fighters.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Venezuela is mired in a dangerous stalemate.</seg>
		<seg id="2">President Hugo Chávez clings to power despite the obvious failings of his government: severe economic deterioration and dangerous political polarization.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The opposition, tainted by their botched coup of April 2002, now seeks to force Chávez from office through a costly general strike.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Both sides justify their intransigence with one-sided interpretations.</seg>
		<seg id="5">His sympathizers glorify Chávez as a defender of the poor besieged by a selfish, coup-plotting elite.</seg>
		<seg id="6">His fiercest opponents demonize Chávez as an autocrat pursuing a Cuban-style revolution and destroying democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Both interpretations are flawed.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Chávez government has not helped Venezuela's poor in any significant way.</seg>
		<seg id="9">On the contrary, his belligerent rhetoric and inept governance scared off investors, inciting economic decline and boosting unemployment and poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Now Chávez lacks majority backing even among the poor.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The opposition comprises most of Venezuela's organized civil society, not only business, but also trade unions, professional associations, and NGOs.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So Venezuela's polarization does not pit &quot;the poor&quot; against &quot;the oligarchy,&quot; but a populist against civil society.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The opposition's view--shared by rightists in the Bush administration--is equally unconvincing.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather than initiating a revolution, Chávez merely spouts fiery rhetoric.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While his democratic credentials are dubious, he has not</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Chávez's insistence on the inviolability of the current constitution is hypocritical.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Four years ago, Chávez deviated from the old constitution by using a plebiscite to engineer a new one, tailor-made for him.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Now he invokes that charter to block calls for a plebiscite on his continuation in office.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The paradox here is that Chávez's earlier example may provide the solution to today's standoff.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As Chávez used para-constitutional means to advance a desire for change in 1999, so the international community should not be confined by the present constitution in pressing to resolve a crisis that is ruining the country.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, the Latin American members of the &quot;group of friendly nations&quot; trying to mediate this conflict can draw on interesting experiences to design such a solution.</seg>
		<seg id="22">After all, confrontations like this are not unusual in Latin America's rigid presidential systems.</seg>
		<seg id="23">When chief executives with fixed terms of office lose political support, they cannot be removed through a no-confidence vote, as in parliamentary systems.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Presidential systems therefore risk lengthy stand-offs that threaten democracy--as in Venezuela today.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But over the last decade, Latin American politicians have made presidential systems more flexible by finding innovative ways to remove unpopular presidents.</seg>
		<seg id="26">One of Chávez's discredited predecessors was impeached on flimsy charges of malfeasance; Ecuador's Congress declared a disastrous chief executive &quot;mentally incompetent&quot;; in Peru, an autocratic president, after months of domestic and international pressure, was forced into exile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">While politicians interpreted the law with a good deal of creativity in these instances, they usually did so to ensure the survival of fragile democracies facing a crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="28">As long as these maneuvers do not proliferate and turn into easy ammunition for the opposition of the moment, they may provide a safety valve for presidential systems.</seg>
		<seg id="29">International monitoring can also safeguard against frivolous use of such mechanisms.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is to be hoped that the group of friendly nations can help design an innovative solution to Venezuela's standoff.</seg>
		<seg id="31">To be acceptable to both sides, such a solution must deviate from the favorite proposals of each.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The opposition prefers an &quot;up-or-down&quot; vote on Chávez's continuation in office, which it would most likely win--and which Chávez will never accept.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Chávez insists on the recall referendum mechanism included in his constitution, which the opposition cannot tolerate: removing the president in this way would require a larger absolute number of votes than Chávez garnered in the last election.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But rising abstention makes this virtually impossible.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Both proposals are thus politically unfeasible.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Only a democratic mechanism for conflict resolution that has an uncertain outcome has any chance of being adopted.</seg>
		<seg id="37">That mechanism is an election, to be held as soon as possible (realistically, by this summer).</seg>
		<seg id="38">Both sides will have to work hard if they want to win.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The fractious opposition will need to go beyond rejection of Chávez, elaborate a program for the country's reconstruction, and unite behind an attractive candidate.</seg>
		<seg id="40">President Chávez will need to clarify the content and meaning of his &quot;Bolivarian Revolution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="41">Since Chávez is a skilled campaigner and the opposition so far lacks unity, he will have a realistic chance of winning--which should make a new contest acceptable to him.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Pressure from the group of friendly nations may induce both sides to accept this last chance to avoid a political and economic meltdown.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Elections can be made legitimate through a constitutional amendment shortening the presidential term, as proposed by Jimmy Carter in his recent mediation effort.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Since this is designed to defuse an exceptional crisis, it would not become a precedent that encourages frivolous attacks on Latin America's democratically elected governments.</seg>
		<seg id="45">An election now in Venezuela will save, not undermine, democracy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Syria's Dangerous Liaisons</seg>
		<seg id="1">All eyes turned to Syria following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Opposition groups in Lebanon, as well as Hariri supporters, openly accused Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime of being responsible for the killing.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Bush administration, while not formally blaming Syria, virtually did so and recalled its ambassador to Damascus.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The US is said to be extremely angry at Syria's refusal to withdraw its forces from Lebanon in line with a United Nations resolution.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Growing opposition to Syrian hegemony in Lebanon is but one of four related problems Syria faces, all of which it has addressed inadequately.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The other three are Syria's behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform.</seg>
		<seg id="7">While corrosive immobility is a trademark of the Syrian regime, these challenges threaten to reinforce each other and marginalize Syria internationally even more so than today.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In Lebanon, the Syrians have repeatedly misread the Bush administration's intentions.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Last September, the US, together with France, sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1559 demanding a Syrian pullout and the disarming of militias -- mainly Hezbollah.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This came after Assad last September imposed an unconstitutional extension of Lebanese President Emile Lahoud's mandate, despite French and American warnings.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Yet to this day, Syrian officials privately say that they don't think the US is serious about a withdrawal.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Syria's leaders also continue to dismiss demands from within Lebanon for an end to Syria's 28-year military presence.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Such demands escalated dramatically after Hariri's death, as tens of thousands of the former prime minister's partisans, who previously sat on the fence when it came to Syria, shouted &quot;Syria out.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Indeed, a broad multi-communal opposition front has formed in Beirut to demand Syria's departure.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Yet rather than address the front's demands and shape a healthy bilateral relationship between equal countries, Syria has sought to divide the opposition and reassert control.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Hariri's assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Iraq, since the fall of Baghdad on April 9, 2003, Damascus has shown undue nostalgia for the old system.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Though the Syrian and Iraqi Baath parties were bitter foes, there was consolation in that both were members of a confederacy of despotisms.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For the Syrians, a democratic Iraq friendly to the US was always far worse than Saddam Hussein, the enemy they knew -- and later profitably traded with -- during the years of international sanctions against Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Syria's suspected support for Iraqi Baathist exiles threatens to damage relations with the new Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Baghdad has repeatedly accused the Assad regime of allowing Iraqi funds to be channeled to insurgents, and recently notified the Syrians that the photograph of a senior Syrian intelligence official taken with an Islamist combatant was found on the latter's body in Falluja.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As a legitimate Iraqi authority emerges following the elections, the Syrians will have to show foresight in jettisoning their pro-Saddam acquaintances.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Bush administration's growing impatience with Syrian involvement in the Iraqi insurgency is a major reason for Syria's deteriorating relationship with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Indeed, there is palpable disdain for Syria in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That is why Syria's denials that it is playing a spoiler role in Iraq are rarely taken seriously, and why Assad has not gained American support for renewed negotiations with Israel over the Golan Heights.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well.</seg>
		<seg id="27">For example, Assad apparently still does not realize how much the Bush administration associates his regime with terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Syrian officials believe that because the Baath Party is secular, the US will invariably support it against an Islamist resurgence.</seg>
		<seg id="29">They fail to see that American officials regard Syria as complicit in the activities of Islamist terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Lebanon.</seg>
		<seg id="30">At home, Assad's regime also finds itself in a bind.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Political and economic reform, when it advances, does so at a glacial pace.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A major item of discussion in Syria is the revival of Islam as an alternative to a political and economic system offering few incentives except to regime grandees.</seg>
		<seg id="33">France's opposition to Syria's presence in Lebanon was at least partly a reflection of disenchantment with Assad's reformist ambitions, and the European Union has expressed similar reservations.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Assad is now in a consolidation phase, leaving little room for reform.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Indeed, his new interior minister, Ghazi Kanaan, an old-school hardliner, spearheaded a crackdown on reformers and Kurds in the past year or so.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad's preferences.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In the coming month, several rounds of retirements should allow the president to place more of his people in positions of power.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Consolidation, however, is not reform.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Assad must show that his enhanced authority can lead to genuine transformation.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Until now, the president has toed a hard line on Iraq, on Lebanon, and in domestic affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="41">If he's a reformer, few are convinced.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Syria may pay a heavy price for that ambiguity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's Divided Racial House</seg>
		<seg id="1">A common feature of Europe's extreme right is its racism and use of the immigration issue as a political wedge.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Lega Nord in Italy, the Vlaams Blok in the Netherlands, the supporters of Le Pen's National Front in France, are all examples of parties or movements formed on the common theme of aversion to immigrants and promotion of simplistic policies to control them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">While individuals like Jorg Haidar and Jean-Marie Le Pen may come and (never to soon) go, the race question will not disappear from European politics anytime soon.</seg>
		<seg id="4">An aging population at home and ever more open borders imply increasing racial fragmentation in European countries.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Mainstream parties of the center left and center right have confronted this prospect by hiding their heads in the ground, hoping against hope that the problem will disappear.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It will not, as America's racial history clearly shows.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Race relations in the US have been for decades - and remain - at the center of political debate, to the point that racial cleavages are as important as income, if not more, as determinants of political preferences and attitudes.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The first step to address racial politics is to understand the origin and consequences of racial animosity, even if it means uncovering unpleasant truths.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is precisely what a large amount of research in economics, sociology, psychology and political science has done for the US.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This research shows that people of different races trust each other much less; whites are less willing to support welfare spending because it is perceived to favor minorities; more racially fragmented communities have less efficient governments, more corruption and patronage, more crime and fewer productive public goods per tax dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This does not mean that the answer is to eliminate heterogeneity and create racially homogenous communities, but an acknowledgment of the reality of these issues is needed in order to start constructing solid public policies toward race relations.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Of course, Americans disagree on how to do this.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Some favor affirmative action programs that provide preferences for minorities in job allocation, college admission, and public contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="14">These policies are seen as a way of offering reparation for past injustices and, more importantly, for creating role models and for overcoming residual and perhaps involuntary discrimination.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Others object to affirmative action, and argue that a race-blind policy coupled with free market polices and pro-family values are all that are necessary to create jobs for minorities and help keep black families together.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The latter is a crucial in any policy, since one of the single most important causes of poverty in the US is the diffusion of single parents (read single mother) households in the black community.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Regardless of the correct answer, the point is that determining what to do about race is a dominant issue in US politics.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Of course, minorities have made progress towards more integration and economic success.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In the 1950s blacks could not sit in the front of busses, today two of the main players in US foreign politics are blacks.</seg>
		<seg id="20">To be sure, right wing American politicians continue deploy the &quot;race card&quot; as a tactical tool.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Take the case of Patrick Buchanan the former Nixon and Reagan aid who became an independent presidential candidate in the last election.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He recently published a successful book entitled&quot; The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasion Imperil Our Country and Civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">But for every book like this there are ten others with a serious analysis of America's race question.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Policy analysis and debates about race relations lag terribly behind in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="25">At most the question is dealt with narrowly, in terms of immigration quotas and border restrictions, not in terms of the social problems and opportunities created by an increasingly racially mixed Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Of course, a clear immigration policy is needed in order to avoid the accumulation of illegal immigrants.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But this cannot be the end of it: border controls with Mexico are not the end of American policy towards domestic race issues!</seg>
		<seg id="28">Europe is rich and rapidly aging; Europeans, cushioned by generous welfare programs, are no longer prepared to accept &quot;dirty jobs&quot; in, say, agriculture or the leather industry.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This makes an increase in immigration unavoidable.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Europeans, however, are prompt to criticize the US for any failure in their policy toward minorities and for any manifestation of racism across the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Reading the European press one often perceives a superiority complex towards the US over racial issues: they, the Americans, have problems with racism; we are immune from it, except for crazed neo-Nazi skinheads and their like.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What has happened in recent weeks, from Paris to Amsterdam, shows that the race problem in Europe is much deeper and, as in the US, stems from the sad truth that race relations are inherently difficult and trust and cooperative behavior does not travel well across racial lines.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If Europe's mainstream parties do not begin a more serious investment in understanding racial tensions in Europe and put &quot;race&quot; as one of their main priorities, individuals like Le Pen are bound to try filling the void with their message of hate.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Fighting the French Exception</seg>
		<seg id="35">Europe's attention nowadays is rightly focused on enlargement and on the constitution that is currently being worked out between the EU's member states.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But the outcome of several Gallic skirmishes with the European Commission will be no less important in determining the fate of the new and enlarged Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="37">France has unilaterally chosen to ignore the Stability and Growth Pact by running a predicted deficit well above the 3% of GDP limit.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The French like to acclaim the rational rigour of their thinking, but where budgets are concerned, Descartes is out and obfuscation is in.</seg>
		<seg id="39">France was among the leading critics of Ireland, when, in 2000, the Irish government reduced its budget surplus, which then stood at 4% of GDP, by a mere 0.5%.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Other countries have violated the Stability Pact, but France is the first to do it with smirking, open defiance.</seg>
		<seg id="41">None of this should surprise anyone.</seg>
		<seg id="42">France is simply applying to EU rules its engrained habit of viewing its own culture as exceptional.</seg>
		<seg id="43">For example, France consistently vetoes reforms of the EU Common Agricultural Policy.</seg>
		<seg id="44">As even children know, the CAP is a handsome and totally undeserved present to wealthy European (especially French) farmers at the expense of the struggling farmers of developing countries and EU consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="45">France is also trying to return to old policies of bailing out unprofitable private companies on the verge of collapse with taxpayers' money.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The EU Commissioner for Competition Policy, Mario Monti, cannot loose this battle: he needs the support of those who believe in markets and equal treatment for all.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Here the story is simple.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The French government plans to bail out Alstom, a company that developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train, but recently went into bankruptcy.</seg>
		<seg id="49">The French government claims that it will never back down from its plan to rescue Alstom, a plan with all the familiar dirigiste motivations: maintaining employment, protecting investors, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition, since Alstom is a high tech firm, the French government plays the research and development card, arguing that investment in R&amp;amp;D is good for growth.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Saving Alstom by nationalizing the company is obviously wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The company consists of many different parts, some profitable, others bankrupt: the obvious thing to do is to break it up.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The profitable parts, such as the TGV, will easily find buyers; the unprofitable plants should be closed.</seg>
		<seg id="54">French taxpayers' money is better spent on temporary benefits for displaced workers than on subsidies to keep an unprofitable plant alive.</seg>
		<seg id="55">It is important that the European Commission not allow France to carve out special rules for itself in competition policy, as it appears to be doing with its budget deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="56">The Commission must strike down public aid to private companies in France as it strikes such subsidies down in any other EU member state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The Commission has already achieved some success on this front, notably forcing Germany to cancel government guarantees on public banks.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Alstom in particular and France in general should not be an exception and should be held to the same standards.</seg>
		<seg id="59">If the Commission fails to act, the EU will look even more like a playground for French public servants.</seg>
		<seg id="60">France has already taken a leading role in EU foreign policy, with Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin looking and acting more and more like the foreign minister of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="61">At the same time France violates key rules of common economic policy and public aid to private companies.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Will the European Commission lose what remains of its credibility and end up looking like a minor Parisian arrondissment ?</seg>
		<seg id="63">A defeat on Alstom would have profound consequences in Europe--and not only for competition policy.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The War for Oil</seg>
		<seg id="1">For decades, through Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, America has pursued a set of straightforward energy policy objectives: keep world oil prices as stable as possible; reduce domestic consumption of oil as painlessly as possible; reduce dependence on foreign imports whenever possible; and diversify the sources of imported oil.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Despite appearances, none of these objectives has changed under the Bush administration.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Many observers believe that Bush has set a new course because the invasion of Iraq seems to fly in the face of these objectives.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A big increase in Iraq's oil production would probably increase US dependence on oil relative to other energy sources, as world oil prices will probably fall in response to the additional supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This, in turn, would mean an increase in US dependence on imported oil, especially from the Middle East.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The irony, however, is that the US exercised greater control over the Iraqi oil sector under the UN's pre-war &quot;Oil-for-Food Program&quot; (in which the UN, not Saddam Hussein, determined the level of Iraqi oil sales abroad) than it will in any future democratic Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="7">If the Bush administration was seeking stable, secure, diverse and cheap oil supplies, it could have simply lifted the embargos on Libya, Iran, Iraq, and Sudan and let the oil gush.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But America's interest in Iraqi oil was not driven either by economics or energy policy.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Bush administration recognized that, above all, Iraqi oil is a critical geopolitical asset.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Whoever controls Iraqi oil controls Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Saddam's power came from his control of the world's second largest oil reserve.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He understood perfectly the role that oil played in his power.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Faced with the possibility of invasion and defeat, Saddam threatened to burn Iraq's oil fields.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Much of the subsequent destruction and looting of Iraqi oil facilities and pipelines reflects the widespread realization that control of oil means control of Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As the US planned its invasion, securing the oil fields became a critical priority.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The goal was not increased supplies or reduced prices for Americans, but stripping Saddam of his power and, ultimately, establishing and solidifying a new Iraqi government.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Iraq's future depends directly on the fate of Iraqi oil production.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Yet the vagaries of the oil business, particularly in such unsettled conditions, make it hard to see how the Bush administration will be able to achieve its goals in Iraq within the next few years.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The logic is simple.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The US must use oil revenues to lift the burden of financing regime change in Iraq from American taxpayers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All reconstruction plans depend in the long run on the ability of Iraq to export oil in large quantities.</seg>
		<seg id="22">If Iraq does not deliver its oil, President Bush cannot deliver on his promises to the Iraqi people, the American people, or the world community.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Before the invasion, Iraq's oil production capacity reached three million barrels per day.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Iraq will not be able to increase its production to that level within the time frame needed to establish an Iraqi government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Any increase in Iraqi oil production requires developing the oil fields, which means big investments, a legal and representative government, and political stability.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Not even the Bush administration expects these requirements to be met soon.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Indeed, political stability is the main condition for increasing production capacity.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Historical evidence from Iran, Kuwait, Russia, and even Iraq itself, indicates that it takes about three years from the re-establishment of political stability for capacity to increase significantly and for those new higher levels to be sustained.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Iraq needs several years to write a new constitution, establish a legitimate and democratic government, negotiate the distribution of oil revenues among its various regions, enact new investment laws, and make the economy attractive to foreigners.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It also needs time to negotiate with the international oil companies and neighboring countries, to perform technical and feasibility studies, and to reconstruct, rehabilitate, and explore its oil fields.</seg>
		<seg id="31">So even a three-year time frame seems optimistic, for it assumes that within that period, the occupation will end, Iraqis will establish their own democratic government, and that political stability will be achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Needless to say, the situation may play out differently.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Tensions may remain high for years.</seg>
		<seg id="34">No one should be surprised, moreover, if Iraqi oil production suddenly stops altogether even under a democratic government.</seg>
		<seg id="35">History suggests that labor strikes and similar disruptions that can halt oil production are a greater threat in democratic than in undemocratic countries.</seg>
		<seg id="36">If Iraq cannot quickly increase its production capacity in the next few years, this will hinder both US foreign and energy policies.</seg>
		<seg id="37">How will the US finance the long-term reconstruction of Iraq?</seg>
		<seg id="38">Who will pay to maintain a fragile Iraqi democracy?</seg>
		<seg id="39">Can the US sustain its occupation if it cannot provide food, health care, and other basic services to Iraq's people?</seg>
		<seg id="40">These are tough questions, and they are fundamentally unanswerable until a stable, democratic regime in Iraq can control and ensure a steady flow of oil exports.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Letting Killers Guard Human Rights</seg>
		<seg id="1">If it were not so profoundly sad, it would qualify as the sick joke of the millennium: Libya has been elected to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights!</seg>
		<seg id="2">When Caligula appointed his horse to the Senate, the horse at least did not have blood on its hoofs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The procedure, of course, was perfectly legal: the chairmanship rotates every year from one global region to another.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This year it was Africa's turn to nominate the chairman, and they nominated Libya.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Only the US and Canada voted against.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To their everlasting shame, European countries abstained.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is a telling commentary on the moral bankruptcy of the UN that this decision comes at so delicate a time for the organization.</seg>
		<seg id="8">President Bush has challenged the UN to show its seriousness about its own mandatory decisions about Iraq: otherwise it may meet the same ignominious end as the League of Nations, which proved impotent in the 1930's when confronted with the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="9">To have Libya elected at this moment to chair the UN body responsible for human rights hardly helps support either the legitimacy or the moral authority of the world body.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Let us remember: Libya is a totalitarian tyranny; its leader, Muammar Ghaddafi, combines sometimes erratic behavior with extremist policies, supporting dictators all over the world.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He heads one of the world's most oppressive regimes, where there is no pretense at elections and where dissent is instantly crushed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Under his rule, Libya has supported terrorist organizations worldwide--from the IRA to various Palestinian extremist groups.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It remains under UN sanctions for its role in the downing of a Pan Am passenger flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, a decade ago.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the last decade, the position of the UN as a symbol of the ideals of a peaceful world community has been steadily eroded.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It proved utterly unable to stop the wars in the Balkans; and in at least one case--Srebrenica--a Dutch UN peacekeeping force stood by and witnessed the worst massacre in post-1945 Europe, as Bosnian Serbs murdered around 6,000 defenseless Muslim men.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A Dutch commission of enquiry later admitted that the UN Dutch battalion was, in fact, complicit in that war crime.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Rwanda, once the genocide started, the UN official responsible for peacekeeping operations ordered the evacuation of UN forces from the country, leaving the field wide open to the bloodiest genocidal massacre since World War II.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That UN official's name is Kofi Annan.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It is a depressing, pathetic record, which the UN is trying--probably in vain--to redeem by appearing, in the Iraq crisis, as the voice of reason and international legitimacy.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But at a time when UN inspections in Iraq seem like sending the Salvation Army to clear out a band of gangsters, raising Libya to head the Human Rights Commission may go down in history as the definitive failure of an organization whose life started with so much hope.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Organizations usually don't die--and certainly there is too much raison d'etat to make certain that the UN will continue to hobble on.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Authoritarians at the Gate</seg>
		<seg id="1">Last Thursday, judges at Indonesia's Central Jakarta Court sentenced me to one year in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As the editor-in-chief of Tempo Weekly Newsmagazine , I am guilty, according to the court, of defaming a business tycoon named Tomy Winata by implying his possible involvement in a fire at Jakarta's South-East Asia textile market, and of fomenting riots by disseminating lies.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Does my case, and others like it, portend the end of yet another short-lived experiment with democracy in Indonesia?</seg>
		<seg id="4">The &quot;riot&quot; that I allegedly fomented occurred in March last year, when almost two hundred thugs claiming to be Winata's followers attacked Tempo's office, threatened to burn down the building, harassed staff, and injured one reporter.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Trying to help resolve the situation peacefully, I was persuaded to negotiate at the Central Jakarta Police Station, but found to my horror that the mob leaders controlled the station.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I was punched and kicked as the police looked the other way.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Fortunately, many journalists came to our rescue with tape recorders and cameras rolling.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Their broadcasts caused a public outcry, which forced our parliament to organize a public hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The National and Jakarta police chiefs were called and, under massive public pressure, the leaders of the mob were criminally charged.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Winata himself eluded police investigation, merely by claiming publicly that his followers acted without his prior knowledge and consent.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He then filed criminal charges of his own, against Ahmad Taufik, who wrote the article, Teuku Iskandar Ali, who edited it, and me.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The yearlong court proceedings were marked by a series of suspicious developments, all favoring Winata.</seg>
		<seg id="13">First, the case built by the police and state prosecutor contained documents that were so blatantly falsified that the police indicted two officers.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But the court rejected our request that proceedings be delayed until the legality of the state's case could be clarified.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The case against the officers involved appears to be going nowhere.</seg>
		<seg id="16">On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to command the newly formed (and US-funded) Jakarta Anti-Terror Unit.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The other has reportedly been sent to the police staff school for advanced training.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Then, in the sixth month of the case, the Head Judge in the three-judge panel was suddenly promoted to become the head of a city court an hour from Jakarta.</seg>
		<seg id="19">One of my lawyers noted that in his 35 years experience at the court, he had never seen a Head Judge replaced in an ongoing case.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, despite her promotion, the judge continued to preside over another case in the same building.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A judge who had previously ruled against Tempo in Winata's civil suit filled her vacancy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Finally, when Winata testified, he perjured himself by denying that Tempo had interviewed him.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A recording of the telephone interview was played in court; sworn testimony was heard from the reporter who conducted the interview and from two editors who witnessed it; the official record from the telephone company was submitted as evidence of the call; and an expert witness concluded that the voice on the recording belonged to Tomy Winata.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But the judges denied Tempo's request that Winata be arrested and tried for perjury, telling us to report it to the police, which we did.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The judges then denied our request for a postponement of the court decision until Mr. Winata's perjury case was resolved.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Given such flawed proceedings, my conviction and prison sentence come as no surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But I remain hopeful that we will prevail in the end, when higher courts hear Tempo's appeal.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Indonesia's courts are cleaner at the top, and the Head of the Supreme Court is a staunch advocate of democracy and press freedom. Tempo's case could become a landmark victory for our democracy, like the US Supreme Court's famous decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan .</seg>
		<seg id="29">By raising the bar for defamation charges, that decision ensures that American journalists can hold public officials accountable.</seg>
		<seg id="30">No country knows better than Indonesia that free speech and a free press are proven indicators of democratic development, and that criminalizing journalists is an early symptom of authoritarianism.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Indonesia was a liberal democracy in the 1950's, before President Sukarno, supported by the military, began a crackdown on the press in 1956.</seg>
		<seg id="32">With critical voices silenced, consolidating unchecked power became easier and, in July 1959, Sukarno decreed the beginning of &quot;Guided Democracy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">For the first few years after Sukarno's fall in 1966, all the benefits of genuine democracy, including freedom of the press, were restored (except for the communists).</seg>
		<seg id="34">But President Suharto's regime began another press crackdown in the early 1970's, ultimately banning various media and jailing many journalists.</seg>
		<seg id="35">With the press under control, other political rights were quickly curtailed and Indonesian democracy failed again.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Since Suharto's fall in 1998, Indonesia has become the third largest democratic country in the world and the largest democratic Muslim community in history.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the latest presidential run-off - have been free, fair, and peaceful, proving that Islam and democracy can coexist.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Democracy's enemies, however, never rest.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Radical Islamic groups have engaged in indiscriminate bombings, while groups with strong authoritarian tendencies have made inroads into President Megawati's inner circle.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But Mrs Megawati has just been defeated in her bid for reelection.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Will newly elected President Susilo continue to prosecute journalists?</seg>
		<seg id="42">Will my conviction, and the trials and convictions of other journalists, mark the beginning of the end of Indonesia's hard-won third democracy?</seg>
		<seg id="43">The answer lies in the support that Indonesian pro-democracy activists can generate domestically and internationally.</seg>
		<seg id="44">To lose Indonesia - a potential beacon of hope to all pro-democracy activists in the world Muslim community - would be a terrible defeat.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Morality of Capital Punishment</seg>
		<seg id="1">The US is often criticized for its refusal to abolish capital punishment.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Many now claim that abolition of capital punishment is a precondition of a civilized criminal-law system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nobel laureate Gary Becker disagrees.</seg>
		<seg id="4">European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment -- the European Union bans it outright -- and some Europeans consider its use in the United States barbaric.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, many European intellectuals argue that not just capital punishment, but punishment in general, does not deter criminals.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But, whereas Europeans, with crime rates well below American rates for the past half-century, could long afford to be relatively &quot;soft&quot; on most crimes, they have seen their crime rates increase sharply during the past twenty years.</seg>
		<seg id="7">By contrast, American rates have fallen, in part because of greater use of punishment.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This includes capital punishment.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I support executing some people convicted of murder because -- and only because -- I believe that it deters other murders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If I did not believe that, I would oppose capital punishment, because revenge and other possible motives should not be a basis for public policy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Serious empirical research on capital punishment in the US began with a pioneering study by Isaac Ehrlich, published in 1975 in the American Economic Review.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Some subsequent studies have sometimes found a much weaker deterrent effect, while others have found a much stronger effect.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The available data are quite limited, however, so one should not base any conclusions solely on the econometric evidence.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Of course, public policy on any punishment cannot wait until the evidence is perfect.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But, even with the limited quantitative evidence available, there are good reasons to believe that capital punishment deters.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Most people, and murderers in particular, fear death, especially when it follows swiftly and with considerable certainty following the commission of a murder.</seg>
		<seg id="17">As David Hume put it in discussing suicide, &quot;no man ever threw away life, while it was worth living.</seg>
		<seg id="18">For such is our natural horror of death…&quot; Likewise, Schopenhauer believed that &quot;as soon as the terrors of life reach a point at which they outweigh the terrors of death, a man will put an end to his life.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But the terrors of death offer considerable resistance…&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">Opponents of capital punishment frequently proclaim that the state has no moral right to take anyone's life, including that of the most reprehensible murderer.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Yet that is absolutely the wrong conclusion for anyone who believes that capital punishment deters.</seg>
		<seg id="22">To see why, suppose that for each murderer executed (instead of, say, receiving life imprisonment), the number of murders is reduced by three, which is a much lower number than Ehrlich's and some other estimates of the deterrent effect.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This implies that for each murderer not executed, three innocent victims would die.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In fact, the government would indirectly be &quot;taking&quot; many lives if it did not use capital punishment.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Saving three innocent lives for every person executed seems like a very attractive trade-off, and even two lives saved per execution seems like a persuasive benefit-cost ratio for capital punishment.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Admittedly, however, the argument in favor of capital punishment becomes less clear-cut as the number of lives saved per execution falls.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But, even if only one life were saved per execution, the tradeoff might still be desirable if the life saved is much better than the life taken, which would usually be the case.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Many people object to comparing the quality of the life spared and the life taken.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Yet I do not see how to avoid such a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Consider a career criminal who robs and kills a victim who led a decent life and left several children and a spouse behind.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing such a criminal.</seg>
		<seg id="32">To me it is obvious that saving such a victim's life must count for more than taking the criminal's life.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Obviously, not all cases are so unambiguous, but a comparison of the qualities of individual lives must be part of any reasonable social policy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This helps explain why capital punishment should be used only for murders, and not for lesser crimes.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When the tradeoff is between taking lives and, say, reducing property theft, the case for milder punishments is far stronger.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Although severe assaults, including some gruesome rapes, may approach some murders in severity, and might conceivably call for capital punishment, I do not support its use in these cases.</seg>
		<seg id="37">A powerful argument for reserving capital punishment for murders is &quot;marginal deterrence.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="38">If assault were punished with execution, perpetrators would have an incentive to kill their victims to avoid discovery (which is a major reason why the severity of punishments more generally should be matched to the severity of crimes).</seg>
		<seg id="39">One complication is that capital punishment may make a murderer fight harder to avoid being captured, which could lead to more deaths.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But, while marginal deterrence is important, I believe the resistance of murderers to being captured, possibly at the expense of their own lives, is really indirect evidence that criminals do fear capital punishment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Of course, I worry about the risk of executing the innocent.</seg>
		<seg id="42">My support for capital punishment would weaken greatly if the rate of killing innocent people were as large as that claimed by many.</seg>
		<seg id="43">However, I believe that the appeal process in the US offers enormous protection, not so much against wrongful conviction as against wrongful execution, so that there are very few, if any, documented cases of innocent people being killed.</seg>
		<seg id="44">And this process has been strengthened enormously with the development of DNA identification.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Again, the debate about capital punishment is essentially a debate about deterrence (which may be reduced by lengthy appeals).</seg>
		<seg id="46">I can understand that some people are skeptical about the evidence, although I believe they are wrong about both that and the common sense of the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It is very disturbing to take someone's life, even a murderer's life, but sometimes highly unpleasant actions are necessary to prevent even worse behavior that takes the lives of innocent victims.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The People Versus Putin</seg>
		<seg id="1">I helped select Vladimir Putin to succeed Russia's first democratically elected President, Boris Yeltsin.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Because KGB/Mafia structures now rule Russia and manipulate the judicial system, it is assumed that Yeltsin wanted to handpick his successor in order to avoid future prosecution.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But we who chose Putin were charged with finding someone to continue Yeltsin's reforms, not shield him and his family.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, Yeltsin was fearless, and sought not his personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced to Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Yet that idea is now under threat because of the successor we chose.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I don't deny my responsibility for supporting Putin.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We weren't close friends, but he and I worked together in critical situations, and I never doubted his sincerity.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Putin acts according to his convictions.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The problem is that his convictions -- including his belief that Russia can prosper only if it is ruled by a single source of power -- are wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This gross error is leading Russia to political ruin.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Of course, no one holds high office without making mistakes, even fundamental ones, and this is especially true in tumultuous periods.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Yeltsin was no exception, but he recognized his errors.</seg>
		<seg id="13">When he retired on New Year's Eve 1999, for example, he asked forgiveness for launching the war in Chechnya.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Putin, by contrast, seems incapable of recognizing and admitting his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure is visible to the world.</seg>
		<seg id="15">One of Yeltsin's errors was his failure to put moral priorities at the head of his reform agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Russia should have repented for Stalinism and the gulag system.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The whole nation, with no exception, should have repented, the way the Germans have repented since 1945.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This failure matters, for it allowed Putin's unqualified belief in central authority to lead to the recapture of the state by the security services.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Indeed, a direct result of national repentance for the gulag era should have been the banning of the communist party and the disqualification from political office of those who worked in the KGB.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Although such political screenings are complicated in postcommunist societies, where both victimhood and collaboration were so widespread -- and the lines between them so often blurred -- a sound solution could have been found, as in the Czech Republic.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Doing nothing left Russia's security structures unscathed and able to make a political comeback, which they have now achieved.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The political resurrection of KGB structures under Putin, and their efforts to silence dissent, has once again turned Russia into a country of defectors.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is impossible to silence independent politicians and independent media without choking off independent sources of money, which is why Putin's Kremlin has concentrated its attacks on the so-called &quot;oligarchs.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">Mikhail Khodorkovsky's arrest and trial were orchestrated for precisely this reason.</seg>
		<seg id="25">By removing independent sources of money, the security services that dominate the Kremlin hope to destroy independent political life in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Without independent bases of thought, a climate of fear is taking hold.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But fear is not only degrading; it makes for poor governance.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yeltsin intuitively understood that fear and top-down, centralized decision-making were no way to rule a modern country, and he therefore insisted on reforming relations between citizens and the state.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Putin still doesn't understand that a centralized political system is as incapable of comprehending and correcting mistakes now as it was in the Soviet era.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Not being a well-educated man Putin is, in full and deep sincerity, leading Russia toward the same disintegration that accompanied the collapse of the Soviet state.</seg>
		<seg id="31">People are beginning to realize this.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They see that Putin's desire to create a strong and effective modern state cannot be realized, because a modern state is governed not from above, but by an informed citizenry that forces its rulers to acknowledge and correct their mistakes.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Putin, too, also seems to suspect his regime's impotence.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This is one reason why Russia has become so aggressive with its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and seeks to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova.</seg>
		<seg id="35">By throwing its weight around in Russia's near abroad, the Kremlin thinks that it can convince Russians back home of its omnipotence.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Given the neutered debates in Russia, and the Kremlin's ability to manipulate elections, regime change is the only option left for those who want to preserve the democratic idea in Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="37">There is no use holding onto illusions.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Those who oppose Putin must decide what they want and declare that, if the regime fails to uphold the constitution, they have the right to force it to do so by any means necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Today, the question of power in Russia can no longer be decided solely at the ballot box.</seg>
		<seg id="40">As in Ukraine, Lebanon, and Kyrgizstan, it will be decided in the streets.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Tax and spend (Please)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Excessive taxation can dull incentives and hinder growth.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But too little taxation can do the same.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Governments with meager tax revenues can't provide basic public goods.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Worse yet, low tax revenues in poor countries often result from defects in tax collection systems (rather than low tax rates) that also promote unproductive enterprise.</seg>
		<seg id="5">India illustrates the importance of a well-designed tax system.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Bangalore, high-tech companies have built world-class campuses replete with manicured lawns and high-speed data communication networks.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Outside these campuses, however, lie open sewers, uncollected garbage, and roads in acute disrepair.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Whereas technology companies instantaneously transmit terabytes of data to remote continents, local transport proceeds at an almost medieval pace.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As a result, businesses in Bangalore run their own bus services, contract with private suppliers for drinking water, and install generators to protect themselves from interruptions in electricity supply.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state can't fix the shambles because it is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="11">India's government debt exceeds 70% of GDP, so more than half its tax receipts go to paying interest.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But the debt isn't because of excessive spending in the past.</seg>
		<seg id="13">India's government expenditures amount to about 15% of GDP, compared to an average of around 40% of GDP in the OECD.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather, India's financial difficulties stem from a badly designed and administered tax system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Rates and rules for personal and corporate income taxes appear reasonable by international standards.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nonetheless, India's government collects income taxes amounting to only about 3.7% of GDP, about half that in South Korea and the other Asian tigers.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Agriculture in India accounts for about a quarter of GDP, but even wealthy farmers don't pay taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Export-oriented companies in the software and other industries enjoy tax holidays on their profits, although their employees do pay taxes on their personal incomes.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Despite reasonable rates, tax evasion is widespread.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Cheating occurs because the government hasn't invested in personnel or in the systems to detect tax evaders, who rarely face jail time and can often bribe their way out of trouble when they do get caught.</seg>
		<seg id="21">More subtly, the evasion of &quot;direct&quot; taxes on incomes and profits reflects the mess in the system of &quot;indirect&quot; taxes levied on production and consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Excise taxes account for over 60% of India's indirect taxes, which in turn represent the same proportion of its total tax receipts.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The basic excise tax has been fixed at 16% of the value of a firm's output.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Then there are a variety of concessions, exemptions, and surcharges.</seg>
		<seg id="25">For instance a &quot;concessionary duty rate&quot; of 8% is levied on categories like food products, matches, cotton yarn, and computers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">An additional &quot;special excise duty&quot; (SED) of 8% is levied on products that include polyester filament, cars, air conditioners and tires.</seg>
		<seg id="27">An &quot;additional excise duty&quot; (AED, not to be confused with the SED) is levied on &quot;goods of special importance.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Exemptions from excise taxes are numerous and complex, including businesses with total annual revenues of less than 10 million rupees and firms located in certain troubled or backward areas.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Overall, the exemptions fall under 70 broad categories, subdivided into 259 entries, 52 conditions, and 7 lists, each containing numerous items.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Exemptions invite abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="31">For a price, low ranking officials, who have considerable discretion in applying the conditions, can be persuaded to reach favorable interpretations.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Goods taxed at high rates (for example, polished granite) are sold as goods taxed at lower rates (for example, as unpolished granite).</seg>
		<seg id="33">Evasion of excise taxes is more contagious than evasion of taxes on profits and incomes.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If one firm evades excise taxes, and the tax rate is high compared to pre-tax profit margins in the industry, its competitors also have to cheat, just in order to survive.</seg>
		<seg id="35">As evasion increases, governments levy &quot;additional&quot; or &quot;special&quot; duties, inciting further evasion.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Collections of direct taxes also suffer.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The bribe paid to the excise tax collector for a favorable classification, the difference between the value of polished and unpolished granite, and the under-reporting of true revenues create &quot;black&quot; funds, which cannot be declared on income-tax returns.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition to impairing the state's ability to provide basic public goods, schemes to evade indirect taxes also discourage businesses from adopting more productive technologies, which requires technologies that involve large-scale operation.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But, because indirect taxes are more easily avoided by operating many small units instead of one large unit, economies of scale cannot be realized.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It's worth noting that in the software industry, where all units are exempt from indirect taxes, Indian companies do operate at efficient scale.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Could India emulate China's example, where the rationalization of indirect taxes in 1994 set the stage for a great boom?</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or are coalition governments in a vigorous democracy incapable of such reform?</seg>
		<seg id="43">Last year India's BJP-led government introduced legislation mandating sharp reductions in the budget deficit.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It then appointed a task force to formulate the necessary changes in tax and spending policies.</seg>
		<seg id="45">This July, the task force proposed raising taxes (rather than cutting spending), through, among other things, removing most indirect tax exemptions.</seg>
		<seg id="46">India's new Congress-led government, too, seems to favor these proposals.</seg>
		<seg id="47">If Congress and the opposition parties follow through, they will go a long way to sustaining the country's economic growth and in dispelling the idea that democracies cannot do what's needed to encourage development.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What's Wrong With Turkey?</seg>
		<seg id="1">On December 16, Orhan Pamuk, one of Turkey's most famous writers, will enter an Istanbul court to face a charge of &quot;insulting the national identity&quot; after he advocated open discussion of the Turkish genocide of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 and 1916.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Pamuk faces three years in prison.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Turkey's effort to fine and imprison those who do not toe the official line convinces me that I was correct to oppose opening negotiations on the country's European Union membership.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In December 1999, the European Council granted Turkey the status of EU candidate-member, implying that Turkey would accede to the Union at some future, unspecified date.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Council subsequently asked the European Commission to decide by October 2004 whether Turkey had sufficiently fulfilled the political criteria -- including democracy, the rule of law, and respect for the rights of ethnic minorities -- for membership.</seg>
		<seg id="6">That decision was one of the last taken by Romano Prodi's Commission, of which I was a member.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Of its 30 members, 29 said that Turkey had fulfilled the criteria sufficiently to proceed.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I was the lone dissenter.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Commission's own report on Turkey, prepared by Günter Verheugen, who was then in charge of EU enlargement, shaped my decision.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This report mentioned that in 2003 some 21,870 Turks submitted asylum claims in the EU, of which 2,127 were accepted.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In other words, the EU's own governments acknowledged in 2003 that the Turkish government had persecuted more than 2,000 of its own citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Meanwhile, the Commission published a progress report on Turkey that granted that reforms were continuing, albeit at a slower pace, under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's mildly Islamic-minded government.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Yet the report also presented serious misgivings: human rights violations, including torture, continued; the military's influence remained too high; freedom of speech was not universally observed; non-Muslim religious and cultural minorities faced discrimination; and violence against women was not opposed strongly enough.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Not much has changed since accession talks began this October.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Beyond the current persecution of Pamuk, unacceptable behavior abounds.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In March 2005, the police violently disrupted a demonstration to celebrate International Women's Day.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In May, the largest teachers' union was banned for promoting the education of Turkey's 14 million Kurds in their own language.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Indeed, intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül abruptly cancelled a recent press conference in Copenhagen when he spied a Kurdish journalist in the audience and the Danes refused to evict him.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Such actions and attitudes amply justify my dissent of October 2004.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But, even if these shortcomings were removed, Turkey should still not be admitted to the EU, because it is not a European country.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Christianity, feudalism, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, democracy, and industrialization have made us what we Europeans are, but they have not made Turks who they are.</seg>
		<seg id="23">So I am not convinced that reforms in Turkey implemented at the insistence of the European Commission would continue after accession.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Indeed, I suspect that there will be backsliding.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Moreover, Turkey's accession would lead inevitably to that of Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, and perhaps of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaïdjan.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The first three of these countries are certainly more European than Turkey.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Leaving the three Caucasian republics aside but including the successor states to Yugoslavia, this would mean an EU of some 35 members.</seg>
		<seg id="28">What sort of Union would that be?</seg>
		<seg id="29">The EU is not simply a club of friends.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is based on freedom of movement of goods, services, capital, and people.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Commission, as the guardian of the Union's treaties, must protect these four fundamental freedoms, which means that it must sometimes persuade, and if necessary force, member states to change their laws.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Alcohol policy in Sweden, the Volkswagen-law in Germany, and discrimination against foreign investment funds in France are examples of cases that made the Commission unpopular.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But they were necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="34">By the time I left the Commission, I was sitting on a pile of 1,500 such infringement proceedings.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In short, EU membership entails having to accept incisive measures that deeply affect a state's internal affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="36">That will be impossible with such disparate members.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The EU would fall victim to what the historian Paul Kennedy calls &quot;imperial overreach.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="38">The EU would become unacceptably diluted.</seg>
		<seg id="39">That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing feared that Turkey's entry would lead to the EU's breakup, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, &quot;Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="40">But the strongest reason to oppose Turkey's accession is a question of democracy: a majority of the EU's population simply does not want it.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Bolivia's Crisis, Latin America's Failure</seg>
		<seg id="1">Bolivia is not a typical Latin American country by any definition.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But for Haiti, it is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, and it is even less stable, with a history of more than two hundred coups since independence.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In a region with a strong indigenous past but a scattered and isolated present, Bolivia is, alongside Guatemala, perhaps the only country in Latin America where indigenous peoples make up a majority of the population.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its topography and ethnic distribution are generating autonomist and even secessionist forces that threaten national unity in more menacing ways than anywhere else.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And, of course, it is, with Paraguay, the only land-locked nation on the sub-continent.</seg>
		<seg id="6">So it would be highly imprudent to extrapolate Bolivia's current crisis to the rest of Latin America.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is far too simple to generalize: institutions elsewhere are much stronger, poverty -- and particularly extreme poverty -- have been diminishing, and the battle over natural resources has been largely settled.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Even in places like Venezuela, with both huge oil reserves and a traditional-minded nationalist government, the status quo allowing for foreign investment in energy resources has survived nearly eight years of President Hugo Chavez.</seg>
		<seg id="9">While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from Chiapas to &quot;Araucania,&quot; from Amazonia to Ayacucho, nowhere in Latin America have they posed a genuine threat to national integrity.</seg>
		<seg id="10">So Bolivia is not a premonitory crisis; nor does the hoary old &quot;domino theory,&quot; to which both Lyndon Johnson and Che Guevara subscribed in the case of Bolivia, seem valid or even half-way reasonable.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Yet Bolivia's current crisis does point to the &quot;democratic deficit&quot; that plagues Latin America today.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Elected leaders have fallen for one reason or another in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Haiti.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Democracy is either defective or missing in Cuba, Mexico, and Nicaragua, and it is threatened by one cause or another in Venezuela and Colombia.</seg>
		<seg id="14">None of these cases are identical to the others; they include varying degrees of danger, harm, or reconciliation.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The question is what can be done about this state of affairs, which contrasts starkly with the encouraging outlook that prevailed just a few years back.</seg>
		<seg id="16">At the last Organization of American States assembly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the United States delegation took a good idea from others and, by its support, essentially sank it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The story began a couple of years ago, when former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo and the United Nations Development Program were charged with drafting the Latin American Democracy Report.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They concluded that an early warning system for democratic crises in the region would help generate action before matters got out of control, as in Bolivia today.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He did, but the initiative did not get very far.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, The UNDP/Latin America Democracy Report, published in 2004, barely mentioned it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The US and the new Chilean Secretary General of the OAS, Jose Miguel Insulza, resurrected the plan during the OAS meeting in Florida, but it was shot down by Latin Americans' reasonable fears that the idea was directed against Venezuela, mingled with Latin Americans' anachronistic fears of violating the sacrosanct principle of non-intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Despite the continent's failure to agree on the principle, the idea of an early-warning system deserves attention.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Today there may be little that the hemispheric community can do about the situation in Bolivia, and yet it is fraught with danger for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Evo Morales, the leader of the opposition and of the coca-leaf growers, may be an honest, if misguided, democratic leader, but are his followers untainted by authoritarian desires?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Hugo Chavez may not be financing Morales and Bolivia's other dissidents, but are Venezuela and Cuba really not tempted to meddle in the country where Che Guevara died leading a guerrilla war nearly 40 years ago?</seg>
		<seg id="27">Bolivia's Santa Cruz business community may not carry out its threat to secede, but will they prefer to share their region's oil and gas reserves with the indigenous highland peoples rather than with Brazilian industrialists from São Paulo?</seg>
		<seg id="28">Before events reached these extremes, it might have been a good idea for the OAS (not the US) to get involved.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The region continues to need that involvement -- on time, on message, and on a proper democratic platform, one that is distinct from both traditional US intervention and Latin America's traditional indifference.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Decline of France?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The French are notoriously sensitive--if not defensive--about France's stature in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The French state spends vast amounts of money to propagate the French language and French culture, yet the French are painfully aware that the global position of their country is not what it once was.</seg>
		<seg id="3">No surprise, then, that during the last presidential election, the publication of a European Commission report claiming France's economic rank among European countries had fallen from 3</seg>
		<seg id="4">The OECD and Eurostat, the European body in charge of such data, thought they put an end to this aspect of the debate by showing that France, Germany, Italy, and Great Britain all enjoy roughly equal per capita living standards.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the broader controversy wouldn't go away.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Worried talk about &quot;French decline&quot; reappeared with this year's street protests against pension reform, mounting disputes over fiscal policy with the European Commission, and bickering with America over the war in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today's best-selling non-fiction book in France is a polemic by Nicolas Baverez, La France qui tombe (Falling France).</seg>
		<seg id="8">Baverez's book is filled with quotations from de Gaulle and Napoleon.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the author, France's last great achievements were in the 1970's, when the fast train, the TGV, and Airbus were launched.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He castigates both Mitterrand and Chirac for their &quot;common talent to win elections and turn France into a loser.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">The book's success is itself a sign of a kind of &quot;malaise.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">But of which kind?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Baverez's evidence of degeneration is not as convincing as he believes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For example, he cites the draining away of industrial jobs as the most glaring evidence of France's decline.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But deindustrialization is common to all advanced countries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Indeed, France does actually better than most of its rich country rivals and, unlike Germany, the UK, or the US, has retained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970's.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, according to a better measure of comptetitiveness, foreign investment, France does very well.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to a recent report by the Economic Analysis Council, direct investment in France grew to 60 billion euros in 2001, almost twice that of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="19">French cost competitiveness also improved (by 20%) in the last three decades, with higher productivity offsetting rapid wage growth.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But the core of France's long-run economic problems is precisely the fear of losing industrial jobs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">France remains a strong industrial power in traditional areas such as automobile and aerospace industries, but it is falling behind in innovative markets, where smaller companies spread new technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="22">France, for instance, spends only $30 billion annually on high tech R&amp;amp;D, compared with $51 billion in Germany, $98 billion in Japan, and $265 billion in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In short, Baverez's analysis points in the wrong direction.</seg>
		<seg id="24">France has undergone a set of critically important reforms over the past two decades: economic and financial liberalization, elimination of price and foreign exchange controls, the end of credit restrictions, European liberalization, reduced inflation and trade deficits, the advent of the euro and the forced globalization of the country's firms.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The French malaise has nothing to do with any of them.</seg>
		<seg id="26">France's problem is that it fails to recognize the new world of which it already is a part.</seg>
		<seg id="27">French state capitalism is dead, and France is finding it hard to come to terms with its passing.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Indeed, France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, feels obliged to apologize the day after for saying on TV that &quot;the state is not omnipotent.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">There are many reasons for this French schyzophrenia, but a critical one has to do with the political game of the past 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Until 1981, France had a clear division between right and left.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Since then, both the Mitterand and Chirac administrations blunted their ideological edge in order to carry the difficult process of adjustment towards Europe and globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A round of &quot;shock therapy&quot; à la Mrs. Thatcher two decades ago might have forged a new political consciousness.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the consensual dribbling out of reforms allowed the French to live in one world and think in another.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This is a key reason for the political cataclysm that exploded during the last presidential campaign, when the far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen reached the second round of the presidential election, ahead of the incumbent Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The rise of the extreme left, which gathered 10% of the vote during that presidential campaign, also attests to this political failure.</seg>
		<seg id="36">France needs a political revolution more than an economic one if it is to come to terms with reality, part of which is that &quot;French decline&quot; is a fear of the French people's own making.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Value of European Values</seg>
		<seg id="1">Europe's leaders have revived the constitutional talks that broke down last December in a dispute about voting rights.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Such disputes are, of course, subject to compromises, which are likely to be found.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What still needs to be settled is a clear understanding of what the constitution is meant to achieve.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Two fundamental principles have underpinned European integration: solidarity and subsidiarity.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Both principles lie at the crossroads of philosophy, politics, economics, sociology, and law.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For years they have been present in the legal and institutional framework of the European Union - in treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights (which quotes them in the Preamble), in the recent draft Constitution.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They are, in short, inscribed in the EU's history and ideals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But what do solidarity and subsidiarity really mean?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Consider solidarity, which is open to at least two interpretations: static solidarity, which concerns only the distribution of income and wealth, and the broader concept of dynamic solidarity, which concerns the production of income and wealth as well.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In the postwar history of European integration, dynamic solidarity was strong in the first period - that of the European Coal and Steel Community - both in its economic development strategy (reconstruction) and in the Treaties, particularly the Treaty of Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This does not mean that dynamic solidarity was subsequently suppressed: European Monetary Union, for example, is an expression of it.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Some countries did not immediately benefit from the euro, but accepted it for the sake of solidarity. They were convinced that it would have positive effects in the long run.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Dynamic solidarity, in other words, means favoring policies that foster investment, innovation, economic growth, and employment.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, as GDP growth in the EU indicates, dynamic solidarity has been undermined over the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="15">What is particularly worrying is the research and development lag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Realization of the EU's so-called Lisbon strategy, adopted in 2000 with the promise of creating the world's most competitive economy, is threatened by a growing emphasis on static solidarity, reflected in high social welfare costs and the high taxes needed to finance them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The primacy of static solidarity is due to an aging population, which, along with slower growth, has led to structural fiscal imbalances.</seg>
		<seg id="18">One of the biggest challenges for the future of the EU is addressing today's prevalence of static solidarity oriented towards old people over dynamic solidarity favoring young people.</seg>
		<seg id="19">After all, the Union cannot afford to permit current consumption to continue to prevail over the investment needed to ensure future prosperity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Subsidiarity is similar to the concept of solidarity in that it, too, has two interpretations: vertical subsidiarity and horizontal subsidiarity.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Vertical subsidiarity concerns the distribution of powers among different levels of government and sovereignty: the EU, national states, regions, and municipalities.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The best-known application of this principle is federalism.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the European Treaties, we find a clear expression of vertical subsidiarity.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But is this enough to encompass the emerging institutional and constitutional settings of the Union?</seg>
		<seg id="25">Horizontal subsidiarity concerns the responsibility and freedom of human beings, as well as social and economic powers.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It encompasses the relations between state, society, and market.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But society and the market have their own rights and sovereignties that are not granted by the state.</seg>
		<seg id="28">So the problem comes in assuring the autonomy of each realm.</seg>
		<seg id="29">An example of horizontal subsidiarity is the internal European market, which created a new kind of economic freedom and increased competition between firms because they are no longer protected by national governments.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Horizontal subsidiarity means that in both society and the economic sphere, the state cannot violate individual freedom and responsibility, which must be respected to the greatest possible extent.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It also means that support must be given by a &quot;superior power&quot; whenever individual freedom and responsibility do not suffice to achieve the ends necessary for human dignity.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This support, however, should be implemented in ways that the natural potential of individuals, society, and the market is promoted.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But that is possible only when the role of horizontal subsidiarity is clearly formulated, which it has not been in the European Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or the work of the European Convention.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In short, solidarity has come to mean redistribution rather than growth (which is how today's generation expresses solidarity with respect to future generations), while subsidiarity has come to mean the distribution of political power, rather than a careful delineation of the boundaries between the state, civil society, and the market.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today, both values are defined in ways that favor the state.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Indeed, focusing on market-based growth has often been identified with the semi-alien values of America.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But these values are deeply ingrained in Europe, and should be brought out again.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The EU should restore its economic vitality by pursuing a model of solidarity and subsidiarity that is more balanced in favor of the market and society, and that reduces the state's socio-economic influence.</seg>
		<seg id="39">State institutions should deliver public goods (like defense, justice, and fiscal and monetary policy), society should deliver social goods (like culture, education, and assistance to needy people), and the market should deliver economic goods (which are connected with profits, growth, and employment).</seg>
		<seg id="40">In the 21st century, Europe must reconsider the value of both principles - solidarity and subsidiarity - if it is to attain integration's historic goal: the freedom and well being needed to overcome the differences and political divisions that incited tragedy in the 20th century.</seg>
		<seg id="41">That is the spirit in which the European Constitution must be written.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Politics of Values</seg>
		<seg id="1">The debate about the American elections has still not abated.</seg>
		<seg id="2">How did President George W. Bush manage to get three million votes more than Senator John Kerry, and, in addition, to have a Republican majority elected in both houses of Congress?</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is not much agreement on the answers, but two themes recur in many explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="4">One is personality.</seg>
		<seg id="5">At a time of uncertainty and threat, people had more confidence in the president they knew than in the candidate who seemed unproven.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The second theme is values.</seg>
		<seg id="7">People voted for a set of values rather than for specific policies.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Indeed, some (it is said) agreed with Kerry's policies but nevertheless gave their vote to Bush, because they felt &quot;at ease&quot; with his general attitudes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Clearly, the United States is now deeply divided in electoral terms.</seg>
		<seg id="10">An arch of blue (Democratic) states in the East, North, and West spans a huge red (Republican) area in the middle and the South.</seg>
		<seg id="11">More than that, the divisions are reproduced at the local level.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Gerrymandering -- the drawing of electoral boundaries to benefit a particular political party -- is no longer necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="13">People actually tend to move to areas in which a majority of others share their values, whether Republican or Democratic.</seg>
		<seg id="14">What exactly are these values?</seg>
		<seg id="15">They have to do, or so we hear, with &quot;god, guns, and gays.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Religion plays a part in them, including the literal truth of the bible when it comes to the story of the creation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The possession of a gun is the ultimate test of individualism, and using guns in wars is not abhorrent.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Gays and other &quot;modern&quot; practices are rejected as self-indulgent.</seg>
		<seg id="19">As the political scientist Andrew Hacker recently put it, &quot;the Bush candidacy was framed to make a majority by giving some 60 million people a chance to feel good about themselves.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">Is all this an American phenomenon, or are there similar trends elsewhere?</seg>
		<seg id="21">One answer is that as an American phenomenon, the politics of values may command a majority now, but it is by no means general.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Europe and other parts of the world are equally divided.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Personality undoubtedly matters, and beneath overt political differences there may also be issues of values that have not yet come to the fore.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But traditional political differences based on disagreement over fundamental values play a diminishing part in elections.</seg>
		<seg id="25">For example, Prime Minister Tony Blair, the next major leader to face an election, plays the personality card and talks about policies, but he represents above all a set of middle-class values.</seg>
		<seg id="26">When he speaks of &quot;modernization,&quot; or of &quot;bringing things into the twenty-first century,&quot; he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.</seg>
		<seg id="27">This has left the Conservative opposition without an effective response.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Even questions like tax cuts and stricter asylum rules do not quite hit the value chords that the Republican Party in the US has managed to touch.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The picture is similar in Germany, where the overt influence of value politics is even smaller.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The German debate is still largely a policy debate.</seg>
		<seg id="31">When the opposition offers the government talks on health-care reform or, most recently, on combating unemployment, the underlying competition is about competence rather than values.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Yet underneath the common battlegrounds of political debate in Britain and Germany and elsewhere in Europe, value clashes are lurking.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Parties fight for those who can be made &quot;to feel good about themselves,&quot; but they may not fully realize that this is only partly a matter of policy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Religion is not likely to become a major factor in European politics; opinion polls show that religious observance marks one of the few major differences between Americans and Europeans.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Guns also have a different place in the European mind; it is their absence that most Europeans regard as important.</seg>
		<seg id="36">A pacifist streak of values is also unmistakable in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the issue of political correctness (&quot;gays&quot;) plays a so-far underrated part in Europe as well.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Most importantly, the Europe itself divides Europeans, as the &quot;national question&quot; arises in each European state.</seg>
		<seg id="39">It is an issue of values, inspired by fear.</seg>
		<seg id="40">People want to know where they belong, and in the process they turn against the US and toward Europe, or against Europe and toward their country.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Either way, we leave the realms of policies, and even of politics, and enter the murky domain of symbols and myth.</seg>
		<seg id="42">This, at any rate, is the main risk that democratic countries face, for the politics of values is a dangerous development.</seg>
		<seg id="43">It reintroduces fundamental divisions in societies whose greatest democratic achievement was precisely to banish fundamentalism from politics.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Enlightened public debate must be a dispute about policies contained by a community of values.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Insisting on this is therefore a primary objective of the politics of freedom.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Coming Age of Interest</seg>
		<seg id="1">One swallow does not make a summer, and one month of normal job growth, and rising prices in the United States does not mean that the Federal Reserve no longer fears economic malaise and deflation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But the time will come when world interest rates begin to rise, as central bankers prepare to resist the upward creep of inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Whenever that moment arrives - whether this fall, in 2005 or 2006, or in 2007 - America and the global economy will face financial vulnerabilities that reflect the success of the past three years of monetary stimulation in stemming declines in production and moderating unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Short-term interest rates are astonishingly low: only 2% in the euro zone, just 1% in the US, and zero in Japan.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Expansionary monetary policy has been successful, but only by pushing interest rates to historic lows - and by convincing investors that borrowing costs will remain at their current levels for a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The main result of monetary stimulus has been to boost asset prices: anything that pays a yield, a dividend, or a rent becomes much more attractive - and hence much more valuable in money terms - when interest rates are very low and expected to stay very low.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This explains the large gaps between current prices for real estate in the US, equities in New York, London, and Frankfurt, and long-term bonds everywhere and what one would conventionally think their fundamental values should be.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So what will happen when central banks start raising interest rates?</seg>
		<seg id="9">In 1994, rising short-term rates caused increases in long-term rates - and declines in long-term bond prices - that were at least double what standard models at the time were predicting.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Moreover, interest rates in the world's peripheral, developing economies rose far more than rates in the advanced industrial core.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Thus, the first danger to worry about for 2005 and beyond - when world interest rates will most likely rise - is another wave of emerging-market financial crises.</seg>
		<seg id="12">For countries like Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, the record of the 1990's demonstrates that interest-rate spreads can widen and capital flows reverse remarkably rapidly, regardless of how favorably IMF officials and analyses by major banks view a country's policies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Emerging-market interest-rate spreads now are abnormally low.</seg>
		<seg id="14">International money flows - aside from inflows into the US - are not yet at levels associated with &quot;irrational exuberance,&quot; but there is still time for that to happen before interest rates start to rise.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This is an alarming prospect, because if there is one lesson from the 1990's, it is that nobody should overestimate the stability of international financial flows.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The second danger springs from high asset values within the advanced industrial core.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve - with which I agree - appears to be that the information-technology revolution is continuing, that the pace of growth of potential output in the US remains very fast, and that the output gap is thus relatively wide.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This implies that interest rates may, in fact, need to stay low for a very considerable period.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Moreover, confidence in the Federal Reserve is high, and the last remnants of the 1970's inflation risk premium have been wrung out of interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, even after output levels return to their potential, interest rates will stay low by the standards of the 1980's and the 1990's.</seg>
		<seg id="21">All of this is, of course, good news for those who own assets like long-term bonds, stocks, and real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Indeed, elevating long-term asset prices was precisely the point of lowering interest rates: making bondholders and especially real estate owners richer, after all, provides a fillip to spending.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the bad news is that even if interest rates are expected to remain low for a while, they will not stay this low indefinitely.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The bottom line is that when interest rates rise, asset values will fall.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is during such periods - particularly when asset values fall swiftly and substantially - that we discover exactly how good our central bankers are at their main job: reducing financial volatility and promoting economic stability.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It is also during such periods that we discover how many people who are holding long-term bonds, real estate, or stocks are doing so not because they think current prices are attractive relative to fundamentals, but because their prices have gone up over the past several years.</seg>
		<seg id="27">This is a crucial question for policy makers, because those who bought long-term assets due to what seemed like perpetually rising prices are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In particular, the US trade deficit looms as a massive source of instability should long-term asset prices fall significantly.</seg>
		<seg id="29">To be sure, the challenges facing the world's economic policy makers during the next several years will be different from those that they have faced since the collapse of the NASDAQ bubble.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The risks associated with inflation are probably less dangerous than those generated by collapsing output and the threat of deflation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But, as we learned in the 1990's, this does not mean that the coming challenges will be easier to handle.</seg>

		<seg id="0">America's Opposing Futures</seg>
		<seg id="1">I recently learned something interesting: American international finance economists and American domestically oriented macroeconomists have very different -- indeed, opposing -- views of the likely consequences of America's huge current-account deficit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">International finance economists see a financial crisis as likely, followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Domestically oriented macroeconomists, by contrast, see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis, but as an opportunity to accelerate growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Domestically oriented macroeconomists look at the situation roughly like this: at some point in the future, foreign central banks will become less willing to continue buying massive amounts of dollar-denominated securities in order to prop up the greenback.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When they cease their large-scale dollar-purchase programs, the value of the dollar will fall -- and it will fall hard.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But, according to this view, as the dollar's value declines, US exports will become more attractive to foreigners and American employment will rise, with labor re-allocated to the newly-vibrant export sector.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It will be like what happened in Britain after it abandoned its exchange-rate peg and allowed the pound to depreciate relative to the Deutschmark , or what happened in the US in the late 1980's, when the dollar depreciated against the pound, the Deutschmark , and -- most importantly -- the Japanese yen.</seg>
		<seg id="8">International finance economists see a far bleaker future.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They see the end of large-scale dollar-purchase programs by central banks leading not only to a decline in the dollar, but also to a spike in US long-term interest rates, which will curb consumption spending immediately and throttle investment spending after only a short lag.</seg>
		<seg id="10">To be sure, international finance economists also see US exports benefiting as the value of the dollar declines, but the lags in demand are such that the export boost will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Eight to ten million people will have to shift employment from services and construction into exports and import-competing goods, implying that structural unemployment will rise.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, there may be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term dollar-denominated interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This mismatch can cause financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as banks' local-currency assets and dollar liabilities caused stress and bankruptcy in the Mexican and East Asian crises of the 1990's and in the Argentinean crisis of this decade.</seg>
		<seg id="14">When international finance economists sketch this scenario, domestically oriented macroeconomists respond that it sounds like a case of incompetent monetary policy.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Why should the Federal Reserve allow long-term interest rates to spike just because other central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Should not the Fed step in and replace them with its own purchases of long-term US Treasury bonds, thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment?</seg>
		<seg id="17">To this, international finance economists respond that the Fed does not have the power to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When forced to choose between full employment and price stability, the international finance economists say that the Fed will choose price stability, because its institutional memory of the 1970's, when inflation ran rampant, remains very strong.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Therefore, since a fall in the value of the dollar raises import prices, and thus functions as a negative shock to the supply side of the economy, the Fed will have to raise, not lower, interest rates, and sell, not buy, bonds.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Serious economists whom I respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I'm not wise enough to say which side is right, but I certainly know which side I hope is wrong.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's Free Riders</seg>
		<seg id="1">In the United States, individual states that follow unsound fiscal policies face a penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Their bonds sell at a discount relative to those of better-managed individual states.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The higher debt service they must pay serves -- to some degree -- as a form of discipline against the temptation to spend now and pay later.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Of course, the discipline of the market is not perfect: the bond market does not &quot;see&quot; implicit future liabilities (like promised pension payments) to any great degree.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nevertheless, this enforced fiscal discipline, combined with individual states' own internal budgetary procedures, has prevented a large scale state-level fiscal crisis from occurring in the US since the Great Depression.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Let us now turn to Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Before the advent of the euro, there were many fiscal crises in individual nation-states in southern Europe, which produced waves of high inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But, with the single currency in place, the road to solving a fiscal crisis through inflation has been closed, as the European Central Bank (ECB) now stands watch over monetary policy.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nevertheless, even with nation-states no longer able to rely on inflation to solve their unbalanced finances, the single currency allows them to use the debt capacity properly belonging to other members of the European Union to extend their spending sprees and postpone political accountability for periods of laissez les bons temps roulés.</seg>
		<seg id="10">To head off this possibility, the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits had to be less than 3% of GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Last week, the government of Germany -- once the most fiscally prudent and disciplined EU country -- broke the pact's rules for fiscal discipline for the fifth consecutive year, and did so without (much) apology.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck signaled that he expected the European Commission to apply some sanctions to Germany: the credibility of the pact would, he said, be at stake if no action were taken.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, Germany would not block sanctions this time, as it did two and a half years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But Steinbrueck also made it clear that he expects any sanctions in response to Germany's predicted 3.4%-of-GDP fiscal deficit to be largely symbolic, not penalties that would cost its government or economy anything of significance.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Stability and Growth Pact is not -- or is not yet -- working anywhere near the way it was intended to work.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What about market discipline?</seg>
		<seg id="17">Is the German government's willingness to issue more debt and run bigger deficits limited because the market recognizes and penalizes nation states that allow their fiscal positions to weaken?</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a word, no.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The interest rates on the euro-denominated sovereign debt of the twelve euro-zone governments are all very similar.</seg>
		<seg id="20">So the market does not seem to care that countries have different potentials to generate exports to fund the financial flows needed for debt repayments, or different current and projected debt-to-GDP ratios.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University of London believe that it is the ECB's willingness to, in effect, accept all euro-zone debt as collateral that has undermined the market's willingness to be an enforcer of fiscal prudence.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As long as the marginal piece of German debt is used as collateral for a short-term loan or as the centerpiece of a repurchase agreement to gain liquidity, its value is much more likely to be determined by the terms on which the ECB accepts it as collateral than by its fundamentals.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The ECB's treatment of all such debt as equally powerful sources of back-up liquidity now trumps any analysis of differences in long-term sovereign risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In the long run, this is dangerous.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both market discipline and sound fiscal management are needed to create a reasonable chance of long-run price stability.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Omit either a market penalty now for behavior that may become reckless or the institutional levers that give a voice to future generations, and you run grave risks -- perhaps not today or tomorrow, but someday, and for the rest of your life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As time passes, the coming of the single currency and the way that the euro has been implemented is generating more and more unease.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Policy as a whole over the entire euro zone is too deflationary.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The necessary transfers are not being made to make the common currency bearable to regions that lose out and are already in recession when the ECB tightens policy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The institutional foundations of stable long-run fiscal policy are being eroded.</seg>
		<seg id="31">And now, Buiter and Sibert argue convincingly, the ECB is giving the market less scope to reward the thrifty and penalize the profligate than it should.</seg>
		<seg id="32">There is no movement of the soil yet, and there will not be for some time.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the ground under the euro may well begin to shift if things don't change.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Trials of war criminals were once serious business.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Recall the photographs of Herman Goering and Rudolf Hess sitting glumly in the dock at Nuremberg.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Some Nazi leaders were even hanged after relatively short but fair trials.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Nowadays, legal proceedings against the world's most wicked leaders have become farce.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trial of Saddam Hussein and his Ba'athist cronies offers an ongoing series of embarrassments.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The defendants try one antic after another, and Hussein shows every form of contempt possible except &quot;mooning&quot; the judge.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is hard to expect an outcome that will appear legitimate in the eyes of Iraqis or the world.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Meanwhile, Slobodan Milosevic's trial morphed into a funeral after four boring years of testimony and a sunken cost of more than $200 million.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In Cambodia, the United Nations and the government have dickered for almost a decade about how to bring surviving Khmer Rouge figures to trial.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The mass killers who took power in the twentieth century were doomed to being killed in popular revolts or to being tried for their crimes -- that is, if they did not die in power.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Who can be proud that Romania's last Communist boss, Nicolai Ceaucescu, and his wife were shot without even the semblance of a fair trial?</seg>
		<seg id="12">The formal trappings of a real court always seem better than instant justice, even if the end result is also death.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A nation could put its own former leaders on trial, as the Argentines did in the 1980's with the generals responsible for the disappearance of more than 5,000 fellow citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At the international level, the Nuremberg model remains available to generate further trials, though under the dubious conditions that victorious powers sometimes impose liability for crimes, such as &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; that were are not properly defined at the time they are committed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There was a time when we could see the advantages of both national and international trials.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Home grown trials enabled the local community to work out its grief by participating closely in the process.</seg>
		<seg id="18">As judges and juries, the defendant's compatriots could also bring greater sensitivity to the assessment of guilt because they appreciated the tough conditions under which a deposed dictator made his decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Argentina's trial of the generals was a successful ritual in the painstaking transition from military junta to democracy, but the experience ended with weeping self-doubt.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Even after conviction, the generals were sufficiently strong to exact a termination of the trials and then a pardon from the succeeding president.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Argentine politics is still embroiled in the legal consequences of those trials of 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="22">At the international level, the UN Security Council's decision to establish the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was also greeted with great confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But then the judges had the misfortune of realizing their fondest dream -- trying in their court the arch-villain Slobodan Milosevic.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is not clear how the Serbs would have handled Milosevic in a local trial.</seg>
		<seg id="26">A lot would have depended on the political party that controlled the court.</seg>
		<seg id="27">At the international level, the fear was not of too much politics but of too much law.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Milosevic's trial had to be more than fair, it had to be an emblem of UN Justice.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Thus Milosevic was allowed to defend himself -- a huge mistake in terms of the trial's length and efficiency.</seg>
		<seg id="30">There was no limit on the number of witnesses the prosecution called to testify about the same gruesome story of Serbian aggression and brutality.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It will take many months to determine what went wrong and why the trial lasted a scandalous four years.</seg>
		<seg id="32">My hunch is that the court's well-meaning officials were too influenced by the South African Peace and Reconciliation Commission, a model touted in law schools as the desired alternative to retributive justice.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Every victim was encouraged to tell his story and the defendant listened.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In the case of massacres endured in the twentieth century, such storytelling can last decades.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Encouraging victims to speak and then giving the defendant the right to filibuster the proceedings by touting his merits as a political leader amounts to a formula for infinite delay.</seg>
		<seg id="37">One lesson we have learned from both the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that one should not put men or women on trial in order to terminate their charismatic appeal.</seg>
		<seg id="38">They will turn the trial around -- particularly if they are allowed to defend themselves -- and use the courtroom to vindicate their careers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Tyrants should be tried only after they are clearly defeated.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Ironically, it was an advantage of the Nuremberg courts that they were staffed by the representatives of the victorious powers.</seg>
		<seg id="41">They were a constant reminder to Goering, Hess, and their henchmen that the Allies were in charge, that the Nazis were irreversibly defeated.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Punishing the guilty, rather than shaping the way history would be written, was always the clear objective of the trial.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the &quot;i&quot;s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The resulting hesitancy of those in charge gave rise to procedures -- both international and national -- that facilitated fantasies of vindication and return.</seg>
		<seg id="45">In the case of Hussein, that fantasy may yet become real.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Everyone who looks at Iraq sees a nation divided between Shia, Sunni, and Kurd communities.</seg>

		<seg id="4">Raised in fear, they had no idea how democracy could apply to their society, or how human-rights groups and other civic organizations could help shape the future.</seg>

		<seg id="14">Day or night, they live in darkness.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Needing nothing more than food, decent housing, and the possibility of a job, these families wait for death, dreading the cries of their starving children.</seg>
		<seg id="16">When I met the women who live in those houses, they showered me with questions: will democracy give us food and houses?</seg>
		<seg id="17">Will democracy stop men from beating their wives?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Will it give citizenship to our children?</seg>
		<seg id="19">Will it give us the right to divorce the husbands who abandon us?</seg>
		<seg id="20">My answer to all of these questions was &quot;yes.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">Yes, democracy will give you the right to live in a decent house, the right to learn and work, and it will give citizenship to your children and make you equal with your men.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But you have to work hard and make every possible effort in demanding your rights.</seg>
		<seg id="23">They replied: &quot;Saddam taught us for 35 years how to be jobless, silent, and fearful.</seg>
		<seg id="24">What can we do now?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">In these destitute areas, where most Iraqis live, people are prey to bitter temptations.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many are beyond the reach of political or government leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="27">They fall easily into violence, theft, and sabotage.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Poverty drives some to take money in exchange for acts of violence, abetted by the lure of a false heroism that they were not able to act upon during Saddam's long reign.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Poverty has exacerbated the trauma of Iraq's violent history of wars and atrocities, which has desensitized people to killing.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Though conditions in Iraq today are drawing many young men toward violence, I am convinced that we need only to provide decent jobs and housing to save them.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Jobs, in particular, will help young people to create new lives through serious work.</seg>
		<seg id="32">We must not use no-work jobs to disguise an army of unemployed.</seg>
		<seg id="33">We must give people jobs that allow them to make a contribution to rebuilding the country.</seg>
		<seg id="34">By nature, every individual seeks to prove himself as a useful person in his or her society.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But the culture that Saddam created convinced Iraqis that political connections are the only way to gain authority, money, and knowledge.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Overcoming such sentiments will take time and a vibrant economy, which means that a new Iraqi government must have limited power, allowing the private sector to grow while encouraging widespread understanding of democracy and human rights.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Religious groups are ready to contribute to this process.</seg>
		<seg id="38">We can also rehabilitate the technocrats who served under Saddam, so that they, too, have a chance to serve their country.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Last but not least, we must provide loans to poor families to help them build a respectable life.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Above all, the government must spare no effort in convincing poor Iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom, and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life.</seg>
		<seg id="41">This will not be easy to achieve in a country where many people consider breaking the law an act of heroism.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But we Iraqis have also learned that power should not be concentrated in a few hands, and that establishing justice requires fighting all forms of corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="43">If the constitution is to operate as the guarantee of democracy, freedom, and security, poor Iraqis must learn to make that fight their own.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Islamist Identity</seg>
		<seg id="1">Everywhere you look nowadays, Islam is used (and misused) as a political force.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some Muslims employ it as a call to action; many in the West (and elsewhere) perceive it as an &quot;other&quot; demanding containment and exclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As a Turk, I feel both sides of this debate directly.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The reason that Islam seems like a religion of the &quot;other&quot; to Western eyes is that the West has witnessed a systematic de-institutionalization of religion.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is not religion that disappeared from modern Western life, of course, but rather the claims that religious institutions can make on individual behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Religion in the modern world is a much more personal and spiritual experience than ever before.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Yet a process of de-institutionalization of religious experience is also taking place within Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Politicization of Islam is displacing the authority of Islam's religious classes, the ulema .</seg>
		<seg id="9">As in the West, Islamic religious experience is becoming more personal.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Interpretation of religious texts by individual Muslims, including political militants, intellectuals and women, is one result.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Another is the vulgarization of religious knowledge, with the Koran's teachings abused and taken out of context to support political ends.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Who now decides what is legitimate and what is illicit in Islam?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Who has the authority to interpret religious texts?</seg>
		<seg id="14">Who can issue a &quot;fatwa&quot; or declare &quot;jihad&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="15">Nowadays, activism and terrorism provide, or rather impose, a new source of legitimacy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">So lay people decide what Islam does and does not mean, without the authority of religious schools and specialized training.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, Islam today is primarily interpreted through political actors and cultural movements, not religious institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This de-institutionalization has enabled Islam to move from being a local and national social bond to forging imaginary ties between all Muslims, everywhere, who feel oppressed or displaced.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Thus, Islamism can unite adherents who previously were deeply divided: spiritual Sufi and canonized Shariat Muslims; Shia and Sunni Muslims; conservative Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="20">At the same time, Islam is on the move, with its believers leaving rural areas for cities, including the cities of the West.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Many see this movement as something negative, emphasizing the fact that these people are socially uprooted, which leads to alienation and, for some, to terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But social mobility is also a precondition for creating a modern outlook.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Of course, through migration Muslims experience a sense of distancing, if not an outright break, from their social origins.</seg>
		<seg id="24">So their religious experience is of a new kind, bereft of theological, community, or state institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Religious experience instead becomes a form of social imagination within which they reconstruct a sense of belonging to Islam in new and strange surroundings.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It is not distance from modern life, but proximity to it that triggers a return to religious identity.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Indeed, most radicalism arises in groups who, by their experience of mobility and displacement, are acquainted with secular Western ways of political thinking and urban living.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Disoriented by unfamiliar surroundings, Islam becomes their anchor.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But for this anchor to work, Islam must be liberated from its traditionally subservient, passive and docile posture in the face of modernity.</seg>
		<seg id="30">By wearing a veil or beard, claiming the right for places to pray at work or school, and demanding special foods, Muslims identify themselves overtly as Muslims.</seg>
		<seg id="31">They are telling everyone around them that they are more zealous and meticulous in their religious observance than those who confine their religiosity to private life.</seg>
		<seg id="32">For example, non-Muslims usually see veiling as a sign of the debasement and inferiority of Muslim women.</seg>
		<seg id="33">From a stigma, however, it has become for Muslims a sign of their positive affirmation of an Islamic identity.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Young Muslim women in Europe illustrate this transformation perfectly.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Girls who adopt the headscarf in French and German schools are closer in many respects (namely youth culture, fashion consciousness, and language) to their classmates than to their homebound, uneducated mothers.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In adopting the headscarf for Europe's public sphere, these girls are unintentionally altering the symbol and the role of Muslim women.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This tendency extends deeper than headscarves.</seg>
		<seg id="38">All Western Muslims possess a double sense of belonging, a double cultural capital.</seg>
		<seg id="39">They define themselves through their religiosity, but they also have gained universal, secular knowledge.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Because they have a double cultural capital, they can circulate relatively freely between different activities and spaces--home, school, youth associations, and urban leisure space.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Being a Muslim and being an Islamist are not the same thing.</seg>
		<seg id="42">What we are witnessing today is a shift from a Muslim identity to an Islamist identity.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The religious self for individual Muslims is being shifted from the private to the public realm.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The question for everyone is whether that search for identity can be satisfied with headscarves and wide public acceptance of Islamic religious practice, or if positive affirmation of Islam demands a more fundamental renunciation of modernity.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A New Era for Islamic Science?</seg>
		<seg id="1">For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The standard of living was low.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Since World War II, the United States has been the world's undisputed leader in science.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.</seg>
		<seg id="18">More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?</seg>
		<seg id="21">This is one unclaimed opportunity.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The US has made profound missteps recently.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Matters of faith&quot; have been substituted for science across government, from the president down.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to &quot;values.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.</seg>
		<seg id="29">At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980's.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Japan's chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book called The Japan that Can Say No .</seg>
		<seg id="34">They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the &quot;food chain&quot; of military technologies was controlled by other nations.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The book's title refers to Japan's plan to &quot;say no&quot; to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible.</seg>
		<seg id="38">For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.</seg>
		<seg id="40">So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="45">There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.</seg>
		<seg id="46">First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Iran's Debate Over Iraq</seg>
		<seg id="1">No country in the Middle East is monitoring postwar events in Iraq more closely than Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Geographical proximity, an intense and bloody history of conflict with Saddam Hussein's Iraq, religious and emotional connections to Shi'a Iraq, and concerns about the United States and its policies in the region are all threads that tie Iran to its western neighbor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Given ongoing tensions with America, Iran is particularly concerned with the likelihood of a continuing US presence next door, as well as with America's dominant role in shaping Iraq's post-Saddam future.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Outsiders may find it difficult to follow internal Iranian debates, but they do exist, and they are intense, even if they are not always visible to the wider international public.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Three general approaches are recognizable in the evolving Iranian debate on post-Saddam Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Iranian pragmatists argue that Iran must inevitably cooperate with the US in post-Saddam Iraq, if only to ensure the rights of Iraq's Shi'a population.</seg>
		<seg id="7">For this reason, Iran should win assurances that a new leadership in Iraq will not be hostile to it, and will seek friendly bilateral relations.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Other vital considerations for the pragmatists include preserving Iraq's territorial integrity and repatriation of tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees living in Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="9">These moderates think that Iran's government should press America for extradition of Iraq-based members of the Mujahdin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), as well as its total dismantling.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In exchange, Iran's government should give its support to ensuring peace, stability, and security in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In sum, the pragmatists would limit Iranian-American dealings, keeping them focused on an agenda that largely reflects Iran's domestic concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="12">By and large, conservative forces in Iran support this approach.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Another approach envisions a more active, cooperative Iranian role in reconstructing Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Advocates of this view argue that Iran is well positioned to make rebuilding easier, owing to its well-established infrastructure of personal and institutional ties in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Eventually, it is argued, the US and the international community will recognize the value of Iranian cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Iranian cooperation should be repaid with the dismantling of the MKO infrastructure in Iraq, perhaps linked to an Iranian commitment to crack down further on any al-Qaida activities, as well as expel al-Qaida members from Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Most importantly, Iran ought to press for an American assurance that its cooperation will be reciprocated by an American guarantee that Iran will not be a target of American military action in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In short, advocates of cooperation call for an open and explicit bargain: Iran's support for stability during the current transitional phase in Iraq, as well as its commitment to maintain cooperative relations with whatever permanent government emerges in Iraq, in exchange for an improvement in Iran's regional and international position.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This view is widely held among Iran's reformers--both inside and outside government--and the more internationally minded technocratic and business class.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Finally, for Iran's radicals, the possibility of cooperative relations with the US is pure fantasy.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They believe that America is bent on undermining Iran's security and compromising its national interests.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the radicals' view, the US will at the very least seek to dictate major changes in Iranian foreign policy.</seg>
		<seg id="23">At most, they argue, America will actively push for regime change in Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It will actively work against Iran's acquisition of nuclear knowledge and energy, and may yet attempt to weaken Iran's military capability altogether.</seg>
		<seg id="25">These radicals view the US invasion of Iraq as reflecting America's desire to encircle Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In response, they believe that Iran must be aggressive in defending its interests, forming strategic alliances with Russia and other regional powers, and using Iran's influence in Iraq to prevent a pro-American, anti-Iran government from emerging in Baghdad.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Hardliners of all factions support this approach.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Overthrowing Saddam's regime was the easy part of the Iraqi crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Now comes the hard part: establishing peace and security, winning the war on terrorism, and convincing the Muslim masses that America is not intent on occupying Iraq, siphoning off its oil, and reshaping the Middle East in its image.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In the meantime, opposition to the US, expressed as suicide bombing and other forms of terrorism, will very likely increase.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Iran is destined to remain a major regional player because its political dynamism and Muslim identity resonate widely in the Muslim world.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What happens in Iraq has major implications for Iran, and the US is well advised to find ways of recognizing this fact.</seg>
		<seg id="33">American threats, or talk of another war, fuel the fires of resentment and frustration in Iran, strengthening the most radical forces.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If the US wishes to avoid this outcome, it must consider limiting the influence of its own radicals, recognizing that America's interests in Iraq are best served by greater cooperation with Iran.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Way Out of Iraq</seg>
		<seg id="1">At last the point has been reached in Iraq where everyone ostensibly wants the same thing: the departure of Coalition forces from the country.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The recent leak from Britain's Ministry of Defense of a discussion paper on troop withdrawal highlights this desire.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The only question is how to satisfy it.</seg>
		<seg id="4">As long as the Coalition forces stay, violence is likely to escalate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But if they leave, it will also escalate, only faster.</seg>
		<seg id="6">So the real question is how to get to the point where Iraq has a police force and army that can be trusted to maintain law as well as order.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Much ground must be covered to get anywhere close.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Notwithstanding the courage of the many Iraqis who join either the army or the police, no one should be surprised if some have motives that are less than pure.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In northern Iraq, old scores are being settled and de facto ethnic segregation is being introduced in areas, such as Irbil, that were traditionally diverse.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In other areas, sharia law is being introduced by force.</seg>
		<seg id="11">So how can Iraq create uniformed services that can be trusted to enforce the law effectively and impartially, without consideration of ethnicity, religion and gender?</seg>
		<seg id="12">The traditional answer is to recruit, train, and instill the &quot;right values.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">But there is not enough time for that.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Other ways are needed.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the absence of a deeply instilled value system, Iraq needs grassroots civil society organizations that will hold police and army to account.</seg>
		<seg id="16">These could take different forms, but what is important is that they are truly inclusive at a local level, and that they get support from district, regional, and national power structures when they highlight abuses.</seg>
		<seg id="17">If there is local scrutiny, and national reinforcement and recognition of the value of that scrutiny, then most members of the uniformed forces are likely to behave appropriately -- and can be more easily identified and dealt with if they don't.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This might appear excessively hopeful, yet in Afghanistan, a country akin to Iraq in many ways, there are groups working towards this goal.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) provides a model of how this can be done.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, ordinary people's highest priority has been to achieve a reduction in violence.</seg>
		<seg id="21">CPAU worked across the country in the last three years to set up District level Peace Committees, supported by satellite Peace Councils in villages.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Committees therefore seek to bring together all sections of the community -- including teachers, tribal leaders, religious leaders, women, police, soldiers, judges, and businesspeople -- to develop ways of resolving conflicts non-violently.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Although monitoring has not been a formal part of the role of the committees until now (it is planned for the future), the mere fact that the police, army, and judiciary are part of these committees brings them into contact with the rest of the community, provides feedback, and starts to build trust.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Some results are remarkable.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In one workshop, the local military commander came for a couple of hours, as a courtesy, and ended up staying for the whole week.</seg>
		<seg id="27">At the end, he apologized for his violent past and made a commitment to disarm his 2,000-strong private army.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He now visits the Committee offices regularly.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In Iraq, projects such as the Humanitarian Liaison Center in Kirkuk are starting to fulfill a monitoring function by offering the ethnically diverse local population the opportunity to bring grievances and get help in having them resolved.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But, too often, even if a court ruling is made, it is not enforced as a result of intimidation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Much good work on strengthening civil society has already been done by American and British forces.</seg>
		<seg id="32">We don't hear about the workshops for women's empowerment, or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country.  </seg>
		<seg id="33">But mobilizing civil society is hugely challenging, particularly when, as in Iraq, it needs to be done quickly and on a large scale.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Military force is still necessary, but so are incentives to disarm, including the prospect of economic opportunities that are more fruitful than crime and extortion.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Fortunately, building the capacity of civil society is as cheap as it is important.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The Humanitarian Liaison Center serves the whole of Kirkuk at an annual cost of just $75,000 a year.</seg>
		<seg id="37">With $10 million, such centers could be replicated 100 times -- with plenty of change left over.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The challenge is to commit to this approach, to scale up and to support to the hilt the brave people who take on the challenge of holding power to account.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Otherwise, the Iraqi people are unlikely to get the security that, after so many years of suffering, they so desperately need.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Democracy on the Nile?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The surprise decision by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow direct and competitive presidential elections may be a giant step for democracy in Egypt and the Arab World.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Westerners used to pluralistic democracy may find it hard to understand what a potentially huge shift this will be in a country accustomed to military rule for over 50 years.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Under the current system, Egyptian citizens can only show up on the day of a presidential referendum every six years and say yes or no to the single name that appears on the presidential ballot.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This explains why someone like Mubarak always received over 90% of the vote, albeit amid indifferent turnout.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Syrian and Iraqi strongmen have done even better with this system, no doubt because they demanded that the names and addresses of voters be put at the bottom of each ballot.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Many people have long argued that democratization in the Middle East will not get far until Egypt becomes fully engaged in the process.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Egypt could not truly set out on a path of democratization without first amending its constitution -- to downsize the Pharaonic powers of its president and set limits on his term in office.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president.</seg>
		<seg id="9">So the announcement that he wants competitive presidential elections is an important first step.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The regime may assume that it will be able to use the process to its own advantage, but events may not be that easy to control once people begin to feel empowered.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The democratic genie is out of the bottle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In any case, Egypt is not the only country in this troubled region that is now embarking on the road of democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Turkey at one end of the Middle East and Morocco at the other are already well on their way.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The real groundswell this time seems to have come from the close timing and positive outcomes of recent elections in Iraq, Palestine, and to a lesser degree in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The unprecedented demonstrations against Syria's occupation of Lebanon following the assassination of its former prime minister, Rafiq al-Hariri, show no signs of abating.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Egyptian opposition groups, too, have staged increasingly bold marches and other forms of civil disobedience in the last few weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The catalyst for their anger was the arrest and detention of the ailing opposition leader Ayman Nour at the end of January.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The government's heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown &quot;Kifaya&quot; (Enough) movement, which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Suddenly the popular wisdom that Egyptians are passive and afraid to act did not seem to be holding up.</seg>
		<seg id="20">An alliance of local, regional, and international forces is uniting against tyranny-as-usual on the banks of the Nile.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The recent wave of popular pressure appears to have shaken the regime.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only a month ago, Mubarak dismissed demands for constitutional reform as &quot;futile.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">But, whatever combination of events brought about his change of heart, election initiative should be welcomed.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a necessary -- but insufficient -- first step for overhauling Egypt's stagnant political system.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Egyptians are already wary of token reforms à la Tunisia, where longstanding President Zine El Abidin Bin Ali created a caricature of a constitutional amendment that appeared to open the door for competitive presidential elections, but then staged a sham contest with a few handpicked &quot;opponents.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="27">Let us hope that Mubarak is more serious about electoral reform.</seg>
		<seg id="28">As a measure of sincerity, he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency, which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Historic Election in Egypt?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among ten contenders, including the incumbent of 24 years, Hosni Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="2">While few doubt the outcome will be his re-election, many are intensely following the process.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Some 6000 domestic election monitors have been training for the event, while hundreds of foreign reporters are converging on the country this week.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Although all the formal trappings of a true electoral contest are in place, important aspects of authenticity are glaringly absent.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Despite promises to the contrary, this is far from a level playing field.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Mubarak still commands disproportionate assets: name recognition, a virtual monopoly on state-controlled electronic media and some 85% of the print media.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One week before the poll, some opposition candidates have yet to air even one campaign ad on Egyptian television.</seg>
		<seg id="8">All members of the presidential election commission are Mubarak appointees, and the new election rules eliminated any independent challengers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Since the year 2000, Egypt's 8000 judges must supervise and certify election results, by ruling of the High Court.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This was a major step toward fairer elections, as the judges' professional union has remained fairly independent over the past half-century of executive power grabs.</seg>
		<seg id="11">So the Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the judge's union.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One was to stretch the definition of ‘the judiciary' to include thousands of loyal government employees who have law degrees but no experience on the bench.  This boxes in the true judges, for if they protest by boycotting their supervisory duties, the task will fall once more to police from the infamous Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, in the past, the judges' union tended to go along, with predictable results.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the 2000 parliamentary elections, while Mubarak's ruling party received roughly 38% of the popular vote in districts supervised by true judges, that percent somehow jumped to 86% where the quasi-judges were in charge.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This year promises to be very different.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the spring the judges held a nation-wide assembly and resolved that unless the regime granted them full independence, and exclusive oversight of the voting process they would not supervise the upcoming presidential (or parliamentary) races.</seg>
		<seg id="17">On September 2nd they made their final demands: allow civil society groups to observe the voting process, stop interfering in the definition of legitimate judges for purposes of the election, and agree that no ballot box will leave the presence of a legitimate judge until its contents are counted, certified and reported.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus far, a standoff looks likely, as the head of the presidential election commission has stated publicly on Egyptian television that he refuses all citizen monitoring of the election process.  </seg>
		<seg id="19">Other interesting developments on the eve of the election include a fierce public debate over whether to vote or to boycott the presidential race.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Several opposition parties have called on their members to stay away in protest over restrictive election rules that strongly favor Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="21">On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt, are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any ‘despotic, corrupt rulers.'</seg>
		<seg id="22">This is a clear if implicit repudiation of Mubarak, the sole ruler for 24 years.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Some 34 civil society organizations are preparing thousands of young Egyptians to monitor the elections despite repeated governmental objections.</seg>
		<seg id="24">These groups argue that if the regime is not planning to rig the vote, then domestic as well as foreign observation of the polling process should not be a problem.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The regime response is to say that any outside monitoring is an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty, and that domestic monitors are an affront to the integrity of the judges.</seg>
		<seg id="26">That argument was quickly undermined when the judges' union announced their support for civil society monitors.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Whether the Mubarak regime is running scared because of the mounting challenges from within and without to hold a free and fair election, or is simply incapable of ridding the party of cheating as a way of life, the present signs do not bode well for next Wednesday's polls.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Meanwhile, Egyptians for the first time are experiencing the thrilling taste of defying tyranny, and enjoying some newly-found space for freedom.     </seg>

		<seg id="0">Europe's Dollar Envy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Currencies can become the focus not just for commercial transactions, but for diplomatic and political wrangles.</seg>
		<seg id="2">When this happens, commercial transactions become more difficult and subject to greater uncertainty.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The politicization of money during the interwar depression was economically devastating.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But there have been more recent occurrences of nasty currency wars.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In the 1960's the international monetary order became the focus of a political tug-of-war.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Each side had quite different theories and explanations of what was going on.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Europeans--in particular the French--complained about what General Charles de Gaulle termed the &quot;exorbitant privilege&quot; of the US dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The General and his monetary guru, Jacques Rueff, argued that the US used the dollar's status as the major reserve currency of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange-rate regime in order to run deficits and pay for its overseas military adventurism (at that time in Vietnam).</seg>
		<seg id="9">France responded with calls for monetary reform that would end the peculiar role of the dollar and tried to revive the largely discredited gold standard.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Europeans began a long discussion of the advantages of monetary union, achievement of which would allow them to look the dollar in the face.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But from the American point of view, the international role of the dollar was a trap.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Other countries could change their exchange rates, and in this way could maintain greater export competitiveness.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The US government was powerless in the face of an undervalued yen, fueling the belief that the rest of the world was using the dollar to attack America's manufacturing base.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Nixon administration came to the conclusion that the only way to save the American economy was to engage in monetary unilateralism--a monetary expansion so dramatic that other countries would be forced into adjusting their exchange rates.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These long-forgotten battles seem suddenly very immediate once again.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The world no longer has a fixed exchange-rate regime, but the dollar remains the major reserve currency--a sort of floating Bretton Woods.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For Americans the reserve role of the dollar is a potential threat, while for non-Americans it is yet another instance of an American neo-imperial quest for hegemony.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In this decade, China has taken the place of 1960's Japan, holding its exchange rate down in order to push export growth.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Consequently it is the target of US complaints about unfair competition, and of efforts to force an exchange-rate adjustment that would deter Americans from buying Chinese toys, appliances, and clothing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Manufacturers in the US have decided that Chinese-made bras constitute a threat to the American way of life.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Meanwhile, Europeans (especially the French) complain about the big US deficits, and de Gaulle's argument that the rest of the world is paying for America's wars is in fashion again.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Some Europeans suggest that Asian central banks should hold a greater part of their reserves in euros, an echo of the General's unsuccessful attempt to force America to its knees by selling dollars for gold.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The 1960's ended in the breakdown of the &quot;system,&quot; and in major financial turbulence, accompanied by an inflationary surge of commodity prices.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Everyone was hurt, and America's role in world affairs was shaken.</seg>
		<seg id="25">A similar collapse now is likely to have a rather different effect.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The floating-rate system of today is stronger and the costs of adjustment differently distributed.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Most Americans do not suffer greatly from the dollar's sharp fall, as foreign sellers have to make price adjustments for the US market.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Asian economies are growing vigorously, and their central banks are building up claims on the US.</seg>
		<seg id="29">They are likely to continue this policy, as the alternative would be a sudden setback to the competitiveness of their export sectors in the all-important US market.</seg>
		<seg id="30">This gives the US a longer time to address a current account deficit that is in the long run unsustainable.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The economically dynamic regions of the world--North America and Asia--are thus linked together in a pact that will ensure the continued centrality of the American dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Americans will continue to pile up debt because Asians want them to do that.</seg>
		<seg id="33">To abrogate the pact would be against the interest of both parties.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This is not American unilateralism, because it means working with Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But to Europeans, who are excluded from the pact, it looks like monetary and economic unilateralism.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In the meantime, the rise of the euro against the dollar creates substantial European pain for manufacturing exporters.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Europe, however, is unable to do much to gain relief.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Indeed, Europe will be the major sufferer in the new currency clashes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Answers that were touted in the 1960's--revival of the gold standard, or the invention of a common European currency--do not appear to be very helpful any more.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Having a single currency has turned out not to afford substantial protection.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The old version of the European response--what psychologists might call &quot;dollar envy&quot;--will only become more acute.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There will be appeals to the European Central Bank to expand the monetary base, as if imitating the dollar were the answer to all the industrial, structural, and demographic problems plaguing Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But a moment's reflection should remind us that Europe's problems are not amenable to currency manipulation.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Protesting the new version of America's exorbitant monetary privilege should be seen for what it is: a way of compensating for a real European powerlessness.</seg>
		<seg id="45">So dollar envy is here to stay, and it will become even greater as the greenback's international value melts away without any obviously bad effects on the people who print and use it.</seg>

		<seg id="0">An Epidemic of Politics</seg>
		<seg id="1">Americans, like citizens in countries throughout the world, have come to accept that politics plays an important role in the appointment of certain kinds of public officials.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Few of us are surprised (though some may be disappointed) when a federal judgeship is awarded or a senior diplomat appointed because the candidate passes a litmus test of loyalty to some principle that is important to the President's or Prime Minister's party.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But science, almost everyone agrees, is different, and here the United States is beginning to stand as a cautionary example to the rest of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Scientific appointments should rest on objective criteria of training, ability, and performance.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Clearly, it is legitimate to interrogate a future Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) about his views on abortion.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But it is entirely out of place when appointees to scientific advisory committees are subjected to tests of political loyalty.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Similarly, membership of bodies that conduct peer review of scientific proposals - a process that is fundamental to scientific progress - surely ought to be free of all barriers to entry that are unrelated to professional qualifications.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Unfortunately, scientists in the US are running up against such barriers more and more often.</seg>
		<seg id="9">During the past fall, the journal Science published several news stories related to the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="10">One involved the wholesale replacement of members of the advisory committee to the National Center for Environmental Health, a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), without consulting the center's director.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Similar cases involved the CDC's Advisory Committee on Lead Poisoning and Prevention, the Advisory Committee on National Human Research Protections, and the Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The current epidemic of ideology, in which advisory committees are shut down and reassembled with new members, and candidates are subjected to loyalty tests, seems old hat to some observers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Officials at the HHS call it &quot;fairly standard practice.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Well, it isn't standard practice in America - or at least it wasn't.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In any case, what's really worrisome is not that the Bush administration examines candidates for compatibility with its &quot;values.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">The most alarming development is how deep the ideological vetting now cuts, invading areas that once were immune to this kind of manipulation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, perhaps the most telling case in the widening political epidemic was a membership re-shuffle of the study section at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health that evaluates grants for studying workplace injuries.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Advisory committees might have been vulnerable to occasional stacking of this kind in the past.</seg>
		<seg id="19">After all, they recommend the policies that politicians may or may not want to consider.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But study sections?</seg>
		<seg id="21">In October 2002, Science published an editorial by David Michaels and a group of colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Several were distinguished former public servants who had been involved with some of the committees in question, and they brought a valuable perspective to the issue, one based on their personal experience.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Their piece was a story in itself, but what followed was even more interesting.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It set off a volley of letters in which scientists told of similar experiences.</seg>
		<seg id="25">A nominee for the National Institutes of Health's Muscular Dystrophy Research Coordinating Committee told of being vetted by a White House staff member.</seg>
		<seg id="26">After being asked about her views on various Bush administration policies, none of them related to the work of the committee, she was asked whether she supports the president's policy on embryonic stem cells.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Another letter writer, a distinguished professor of psychiatry and psychology, reported receiving a call from the White House about his nomination to serve on the National Council on Drug Abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The caller declared that he must vet him to &quot;determine whether he held any views that might be embarrassing to the president.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">According to the professor, a series of questions followed, with the White House official keeping a running score.</seg>
		<seg id="30">One example: &quot;You're two for three; the president opposes needle exchange (for intravenous drug users) on moral grounds, regardless of the outcome.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="31">Then the exchange took an even more chilling turn.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The official asked the nominee whether he had voted for Bush, and, on being informed that he had not, asked: &quot;Why didn't you support the president?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">This is the stuff of dictatorship, not democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The purpose of scientific advisory committees is to provide balanced, thoughtful advice to the policy process.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nothing is gained - and much is lost - when a desired policy outcome is put first.</seg>
		<seg id="36">This is why deciding which research projects to support has always been a matter for objective peer review, not politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In fact, the applicable statute for all this - the Federal Advisory Committee Act - specifically requires that committees be balanced and &quot;not inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="38">US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and the White House Personnel Office ought to set an example to the rest of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="39">They can do so very easily: by following the law.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A Murder in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin's &quot;dictatorship of law&quot; has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia's bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Germany's Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin's lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia's economy.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense of déjà vu : just as in the KGB's heyday, people simply disappear in Putin's Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Politkovskaya's is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia's central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The fact that Russia's Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya's killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn't inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia's government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Politkovskaya's murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia's President.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow, Novaya Gazeta, and in her books &quot;Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy&quot; and &quot;A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya,&quot; Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin's presidency.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin's enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I am not accusing Putin's government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.</seg>
		<seg id="16">After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But even if Vladimir Putin's associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Putin's Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.</seg>
		<seg id="21">None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin's &quot;dictatorship of law&quot; was anything more than a PR strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.</seg>
		<seg id="24">On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.</seg>
		<seg id="25">These &quot;neo-spies&quot; include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin's Kremlin cabal.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The danger for the world is that Putin's lawlessness is being exported.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Across Russia's near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Look at Putin's attempt to rig Ukraine's previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin's backing.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.</seg>
		<seg id="35">So the world must now ponder that old Latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur -- silence means consent -- and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin's construction of a lawless energy superpower.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Russia's Pipeline to Empire</seg>
		<seg id="1">Gerhard Schroeder, who less than a month ago was Germany's Chancellor, has agreed to become chairman of the company that is building a gas pipeline from Russia, across the Baltic Sea to Germany, and on through Western Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In many countries, Schroeder would now be charged with the crime of conflict of interest.</seg>
		<seg id="3">His apparent ethical lapse is magnified by the fact that, at this very moment, Russia is threatening to cut off Ukraine's gas supplies if that country does not give in to the pricing demands of Kremlin's state-owned gas behemoth, Gazprom.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Russia's strategic task is obvious: cutting off Ukraine's gas currently means cutting off much of Europe's gas as well, because some of its biggest gas pipelines pass through Ukraine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">By circumventing Ukraine, Poland, and of course, the Baltic countries, the new pipeline promises greater leverage to the Kremlin as it seeks to reassert itself regionally.</seg>
		<seg id="6">President Vladimir Putin and his administration of ex-KGB clones will no longer have to worry about Western Europe when deciding how hard to squeeze Russia's postcommunist neighbors.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Should Europe really be providing Putin with this new imperial weapon?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Worse, might Russia turn this weapon on an energy-addicted EU?</seg>
		<seg id="9">That a German ex-chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy is testimony to Europe's dangerous complacency in the face of Putin's neo-imperialist ambitions.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Certainly Russia's media are aware of Europe's growing dependence on Russian energy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Indeed, they revel in it: after we integrate and increase our common gas business, Russian editorialists write, Europe will keep silent about human rights.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Putin expresses this stance in a more oblique way with his commitment to pursuing what he calls an &quot;independent policy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">What he means by that is that Russia is to be &quot;independent&quot; of the moral and human rights concerns of the Western democracies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Perhaps some European leaders really do believe that maintaining the Union's cozy prosperity justifies silencing ourselves on human rights and other issues that annoy the Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Of course, we may speak up, briefly, about &quot;commercial&quot; matters like the expropriation of Yukos, but if the Kremlin puts a price on our values or criticism of Russian wrongdoing -- as in, say, bloodstained Chechnya -- Europeans seem willing to shut up rather than face the possibility of higher energy prices, or even a blockade like that now facing Ukraine.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As Putin shuffles his court, subordinating the Duma to his will, the EU's hopes for a growing &quot;Europeanization&quot; of Russia should be abandoned.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The Russia that Putin is building has mutated from the post-Soviet hopes of freedom into an oil and gas bulwark for his new model ex-KGB elite.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Indeed, Matthias Warnig, the chief executive of the pipeline consortium that Schroeder will chair, is a longtime Putin friend.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Warnig, who heads Dresdner Bank's Russian arm, was an officer in the Stasi, the East German secret police, and met Putin in the late 1980's when the Russian president was based in East Germany as a KGB spy.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That Russians tolerate a government of ex-KGB men, for whom lack of compassion and intolerance of dissent are the norm, reflects their exhaustion from the tumult of the last 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now the Kremlin seems to think that what is good for ordinary Russians is good for independent nations as well: small and weak countries will be shown no mercy once Russia is given the tools to intimidate, isolate, and threaten them with the prospect of an energy blockade.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The EU has signed numerous agreements with Russia including one for a &quot;common space&quot; for freedom and justice.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Kremlin is very good at feigning such idealism.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Its control of Eastern Europe was always enforced on the basis of &quot;friendship treaties,&quot; and the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were &quot;fraternal&quot; missions.</seg>
		<seg id="26">But look how Putin abuses that &quot;common&quot; space: barbaric treatment of Chechens, the businessmen Mikhail Khodorkovsky imprisoned, foreign NGO's hounded, a co-leader of last year's Orange Revolution, Yuliya Tymoshenko, indicted by Russian military prosecutors on trumped-up charges.</seg>
		<seg id="27">If Europeans are serious about their common space for human rights and freedoms, they must recognize that those values are not shared by the calculating placemen of Putin's Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The same is true of viewing Russia as an ally in the fight against terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Is it really conceivable that the homeland of the &quot;Red Terror&quot; with countless unpunished crimes from the Soviet era, and which bears traces of blood from Lithuania to the Caucasus, will provide reliable help in stopping Iran and North Korea from threatening the world?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It seems more likely that the Kremlin's cold minds will merely exploit each crisis as an opportunity to increase their destructive power and influence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">For decades, my region of Europe was left to the mercy of evil.</seg>
		<seg id="32">So I cannot sit back in silence as Europe stumbles blindly into a new appeasement.</seg>
		<seg id="33">We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have been taught by our legacy that behind Russia's every diplomatic act lurks imperial ambition.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Western Europeans, who have been spared this legacy, should heed our warnings.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Dependence on Russia -- even if its face is now that of the allegedly &quot;charismatic&quot; Gerhard Schroeder -- will only lead to an abyss.</seg>

		<seg id="3">In today's Iraq, there is no peace and no prosperity.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The constitution that will be voted on October 15th includes that 25% rule, but otherwise is far from liberal.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The key provision (article 2) that no law may contradict &quot;the undisputed rules of Islam&quot; violates the basic principle of parliamentary sovereignty, and will prevent legislation from meeting international standards.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For example, the age of sexual consent for girls cannot be set above nine, because Muhhamad himself had a nine-year-old wife.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It follows that nine-year-old girls are also adults in criminal law, and subject to capital punishment for, say, converting to another religion.</seg>
		<seg id="8">More broadly, the Shias can use this provision to place their ayatollahs over the elected parliament, as in Iran, because they alone are authorized to determine the &quot;rules&quot; of Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Outsiders and the few Iraqi liberals worry mainly about this Islamic provision, but the widespread Sunni opposition to the constitution is aimed at other provisions: the exclusion of the &quot;Saddamist Ba'ath Party&quot; from political life and government, and the federalist provisions that grant autonomy to the 18 Iraqi provinces and allow them to combine into regional governments.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The exclusion rule is a personal issue for elite Sunnis -- including thousands of businessmen, professionals, even artists -- because, with few exceptions, they were all Ba'ath members.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In theory, the constitutional prohibition could be interpreted as applying only to the future.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But in practice administrative rules are now being applied to exclude so-called &quot;high-ranking&quot; Ba'ath members from any form of government employment, and thousands are affected.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Sunnis would probably accept the federalist provisions if they applied only to the Kurds.</seg>
		<seg id="14">They know that the alternative is not a return to centralism, but secession by the three Kurdish-majority provinces of Dahuk, Arbil, and As Sulaymaniyah to form an independent Kurdistan, with its own treasury, army (the Pesh Merga), and oil production around Kirkuk -- the second-largest reserves in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Sunnis reject the same federalism for the Shias because they view them as fellow Arabs who have always accepted Sunni rule in the past, and will do so again -- unless they have their own government.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That is what the new constitution would allow, because the Shia-majority provinces in the south -- which contain the greater part of Iraq's oil reserves -- could form their own regional government.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the usual style of the Middle East, disappointed Sunni leaders, unhappy with the constitution, now threaten violence.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But federalism is not the reason why Sunni supremacists and Islamists launch deadly attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Their opposition is more elemental: they do not accept the principle of democratic majority rule.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Instead, they seek to restore Sunni minority rule.</seg>
		<seg id="21">For the Islamists, all Shias deserve death anyway, as apostates.</seg>
		<seg id="22">One Shia leader, Moqtada Sadr, also vehemently opposes federalism.</seg>
		<seg id="23">His followers are the largely illiterate, poorest, and most violent Shias of the slums of Baghdad and beyond, whose &quot;Mahdi militia&quot; fought American troops in 2004, even while the Americans were protecting Shias from Sunni attackers.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a very junior priest who derives his authority from his dead Ayatollah father -- himself a populist -- Sadr is opposed by Iraq's living Ayatollahs, who despise his ignorance and violence.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Sadr cannot possibly compete with them in religious authority, so he takes an Arab-nationalist stance against them, often recalling that the highest Shia cleric, Ayatollah Sistani, is a Persian, not an Arab.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Similarly, he reminds his followers that the El Hakims, who head the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and their &quot;Badr&quot; militia were subsidized exiles in Iran -- many fighting for Iran in the long and bitter Iran-Iraq war -- until the Americans &quot;brought them back.&quot; </seg>
		<seg id="27">Sadr opposes federalism because a Shia regional government would obey his enemies, Sistani and the SCIRI, and, he says, fall under Iranian influence.</seg>
		<seg id="28">To underline his message, Sadr sent his men to attack the Badr militia, succeeding in Baghdad, where the Mahdis are numerous, but failing in Najaf, where Sadr is hated after the destruction caused last year -- until his men were massacred by the Americans.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It was bad enough to deal with Sadr as a bandit; simple political arithmetic now dictates that he will likely be the central figure deciding the outcome of October's vote on the constitution.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To reject the constitution and force new elections for a constitutional assembly, opponents need a two-thirds majority in at least three provinces.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Sunnis are only likely to win in two provinces, but if Sadr orders his followers in Baghdad's slums to vote &quot;no&quot; alongside local Sunnis, that would probably flip the capital to the constitution's opponents, ensuring its defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">As a political thug, Sadr is, of course, willing to be bought.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Last year he was wanted for murder.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Now he wants recognition as a statesman, money, and, at least implicitly, Sistani's and the SCIRI's humiliation.</seg>
		<seg id="35">He might receive offers, and perhaps the bargaining has already started.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But some of the Shias whom he attacks with words and bullets have thousands under arms, and think that he should be offered only bullets.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Secret Policeman's Fall</seg>
		<seg id="1">As Hungary's Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany found out when a recorded admission that his government was lying incited riots, openness in government doesn't come easily in Eastern Europe's new democracies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Like Hungary, post-communist Romania has struggled to increase transparency and honesty in what was once one of the world's most closed societies.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But there has, at last, been real movement towards openness -- progress recognized by the European Union when it gave Romania the green light to join the European Union at the beginning of 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Aside from achieving what the EU now deems a &quot;functioning market economy,&quot; key political and legal changes, which I have overseen as Minister of Justice, range from increased transparency and control in the funding of political parties to a shakeup of the judiciary.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Judicial reforms are, in turn, helping to root out corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indictments have been issued against former and current cabinet ministers, members of parliament, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, police and customs officers, and other public officials, as well as directors of private companies.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In addition, new standardized forms have been introduced for declarations of assets and financial interests by anyone who holds an official position in government, parliament, public and local administration, and the judicial system.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The new declarations are the most detailed in Europe, and, more importantly, they are published.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Romania's progress is confirmed in a report released earlier this month showing that citizens' access to government information in Eastern Europe is now equal to that in established democracies.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Indeed, the report, Transparency and Silence, conducted by the Open Society Justice Initiative (available at www.justiceinitiative.org), indicates that in some ways the new democracies have something to teach the old: certain government agencies in Romania were more responsive to citizen requests for information than comparable agencies in France and Spain.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Specifically, 60% of the requests filed in Romania met, compared to 31% in France and 24% in Spain.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But getting access to sensitive information in transitional democracies is not always easier, as I know from my previous work as a human rights lawyer with the Romanian Helsinki Committee.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Often we had to go to court to force disclosure of information, using Romania's 2001 Freedom of Information Act.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For example, even when we won a case regarding access to the records of wiretaps authorized by the general prosecutor, the prosecutor simply ignored the court order.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We filed a civil action against the prosecutor, and the judge imposed a fine for every day the information was withheld.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But it was only when we caught the media's attention that the data -- detailing the number of wiretaps authorized over the previous 10 years, against whom, and for how long -- were released.</seg>
		<seg id="19">With its publication, Romania began to move away from its Securitate-dominated past.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Now, inside government, I realize that sharing information with the public is sometimes hard.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But when painful reforms are necessary, there is no alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="22">We could not have achieved the economic and political reforms that qualified us for EU membership if we had not subjected policymaking to public scrutiny and accepted the increased public participation in decision-making that inevitably accompanies such openness.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world.</seg>
		<seg id="24">When the United States adopted its Freedom of Information Act in 1966, it joined the exclusive company of Sweden and Finland.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Today, roughly 65 countries have such laws.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In Romania, those who fought for a freedom of information law have made full use of it.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As part of the Justice Initiative study, those who request information from Romania's government were willingly supplied with the kind of information that would have been unthinkable to release just a few short years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The Romanian Defense Ministry, for example, disclosed the number of armed forces personnel who died in 2003, as well as the causes of death (including 13 suicides, two shootings, and two combat deaths in Afghanistan).</seg>
		<seg id="29">Likewise, the Bucharest court was asked for the number of judges disciplined since the beginning of 2000, including grounds for any sanctions applied.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Court transferred the request to the Superior Council of Magistrates, which provided a full response: a four-page list of all sanctioned judges, with details of the reasons and penalties.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Such information is both a product and a motor of continuing reform.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It has not always been comfortable for those in government, and there is still a tug-of-war over sensitive documents.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable.</seg>
		<seg id="34">At the same time, Romania's experience demonstrates that official secrecy remains a threat to the core values of democratic governance, and that only constant vigilance, in both established and young democracies, can prevent its encroachment.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Saving the Trees of Life</seg>
		<seg id="1">Nobody can get through the day without using a product that comes from a forest.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To a greater extent than most people realize, the paper we write on, the water that comes out of our taps, the medicine that heals us, the wood that builds our houses and furniture, all originate from forests.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Forests provide the fresh air we breathe and habitats for endangered species.</seg>
		<seg id="4">They also provide us with recreational opportunities, increasingly important in our complex world.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Approximately 1.5 billion of the world's rural poor directly depend on forests for basic needs like food and fuel-wood.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Yet deforestation continues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Every year, we lose 14.6 million hectares (56,000 square miles) of forests -- an area almost four times the area of Switzerland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Irresponsible forest management, enhanced by poor governmental regulation and enforcement, and markets that reward illegal logging, are conspiring to denude the world's most valuable and threatened forests.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Once forests start to disappear, a host of environmental, social, and economic ills usually follow, affecting us all in some way.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Indonesia's Sumatra Island is a good example.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Pulp and paper companies are driving rampant and illegal destruction of forests that contain the richest diversity of plants in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It is likely that plants not yet discovered will disappear along the way, as well as such endangered species as the Sumatran rhino and elephant, as well as the orangutan.</seg>
		<seg id="13">When Sumatra's forests disappear, entire communities of people will also find themselves with no proper place to live and no decent way to make a living.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Moreover, the distortion to global markets caused by trading in illegally, cheaply produced products results in disadvantages for responsible corporate citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Developing countries are losing $15 billion in tax revenues annually due to illegal logging.</seg>
		<seg id="16">To make matters worse, the demand for wood for reconstruction following last year's tsunami is intensifying the already untenable demands being placed on Sumatra's forests.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Similar threats to forests are evident in the Amazon and Congo Basin.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The recent UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) shows that forests in these and other critical regions are in serious decline due to mismanagement and will continue to disappear unless serious measures are taken.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Information released by the government of Brazil indicates that deforestation of the irreplaceable forests of the Amazon, due to factors such as agricultural conversion, reached 2.6 million hectares (roughly 10,000 square miles) in the past year, bringing the total deforested area of the Amazon to 17%.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But the battle against deforestation is not lost.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Diverse organizations, environmentalists, and corporations concerned with the state of world's forests are joining forces to reverse deforestation and improve forest management.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For example, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the World Bank have helped Brazil's government kick-start an initiative that established over 17 million hectares (69,000 square miles) of new forest-protected areas such as national parks.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The WWF/World Bank alliance also motivated partners to establish a trust fund to manage these protected areas in perpetuity.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Similarly, a summit among the leaders of the Congo Basin countries resulted in extraordinary cross-border cooperation on forest conservation and responsible management.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This in turn led to a $53 million initiative by the United States State Department to promote Congo forest conservation.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Since the leaders first met in 1999, 3.5 million hectares (more than 13,000 square miles) of new protected areas have been established in the Congo Basin.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Nevertheless, given the effects of last December's Asian tsunami, the weight of evidence provided by the MEA, and deforestation statistics from key forest regions, our efforts must continue.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The World Bank and WWF recently pledged to unite in an effort to assist in reducing the rate of global deforestation by 10% by 2010, and to work with other public and private sector institutions to pursue ambitious targets on forest conservation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">WWF studies show that if the world's forests are allotted among a mix of uses and types -- including protected areas, responsibly managed commercial forests, and restored forest landscapes -- we can provide the world's needs for forest products while conserving important environmental and social values for the foreseeable future.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Business leaders, governments, and civil society organizations must play their part in realizing this vision.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Are the Saudis Fanatics?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question not only the ruling House of Saud's prospects for survival, but also whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Somehow, it seems, Saudi society has produced a stream of violent fanaticism that draws its inspiration from extreme religious orthodoxy.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States were Saudis crystallized a long-held view of the kingdom as a bastion of authoritarianism and intolerance.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In some respects, this perception is accurate, but it cannot be applied to the broad Saudi public.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On the contrary, it would be a grave mistake to assume that fanatical Islamism fully defines Saudi attitudes toward religion.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Between 2001 and 2003, I was part of a team that undertook an extensive survey of values in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, and Jordan.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Our results provide a surprisingly nuanced picture of Saudi attitudes.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Compared to respondents in the other Middle Eastern countries, Saudis were less religious overall, and their attitudes toward democracy and arranged marriage also indicate a moderate undercurrent.</seg>
		<seg id="9">To be sure, in all four countries, religiosity is widespread, with more than 90% of respondents collectively reporting that they believe in God, in life after death, and in heaven and hell.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But the Saudis appear to be less religious than their fellow Muslims.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Sixty-two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious, compared with 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians, and 98% of Egyptians.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Americans also appear to be far more religious than Saudis, with 81% describing themselves that way.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Some of this variation may be explained by cross-national differences regarding what it means to be religious.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For example, Americans may define religiosity differently than Middle Easterners, with perhaps a weaker attachment to religious beliefs than is true in Islamic countries.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This might also account in part for the differences between Muslim countries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the gap in self-defined religiosity between Saudis, on the one hand, and Iranians, Jordanians, and Egyptians, on the other, is so great that it challenges the prevalent perception of Saudi Arabia as a highly conservative and religious society.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, actions speak louder than words: only 28% of Saudis said that they participate in weekly religious services, compared to 27% of Iranians, 44% of Jordanians, 42% of Egyptians, and 45% of Americans.</seg>
		<seg id="18">These findings, while running contrary to popular perceptions of Saudi culture, are less startling than they appear.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Sociologists of religion have long argued that in a monolithic religious environment, or when religious institutions are closely tied to the state, the overall religiosity of the public declines.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It makes sense to think that when state authorities enforce strict codes of behavior, people tend to rebel and move away from officially sanctioned religious institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Little wonder, then, that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must cope with local &quot;virtue&quot; police backed by the state.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Even on marriage, many Saudis expressed surprisingly liberal views.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Respondents were nearly evenly split on the question of arranged marriages, with half supporting the idea that marriage should be based on parental consent, while 48% preferred love as the basis of matrimony.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Given entrenched gender segregation and paternal dominance, this finding appears to reveal a strong desire for greater individual choice in what has traditionally been a family-driven decision.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Finally, the Saudis turn out to be strong supporters of democracy, once again contradicting a popular image of Saudi conservatism.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Of the Saudis polled, 58% considered democracy the best form of government, 23% disagreed, and 18% did not express an opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Majority support for democracy in a country with no prior secular and nationalist history seems counter-intuitive.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In fact, support for democracy corresponds with a number of other liberal attitudes that we found in Saudi Arabia.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Supporters of democracy tend to be less religious, more secular, more tolerant of others, more critical of public-sector performance, and more concerned with Western cultural invasion.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Beyond the survey data, history has shown that liberal ideas become more popular when a despotic monarch governs people in alliance with a religious establishment.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.</seg>
		<seg id="32">At the same time, an anti-clerical, secular movement on behalf of constitutionalism appeared in Iran - a reaction to the absolutist alliance between the Quajar Shahs and the religious establishment.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In view of the similarities between those historical precedents and current conditions in Saudi Arabia, we ought not to rule out the possibility of reform.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Now survey data, too, suggest that Saudis may well begin demanding a more transparent politics and a less interventionist religion.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The European Museum</seg>
		<seg id="1">In the late nineteenth century, Europe viewed Asia mainly as either a source of inspiration for its artists or a focus of imperial ambition.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Asians, for their part, viewed Europe as either a model of modernity, as in Meiji Japan, or a barometer of decay, as in China.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Now, in the first years of the twenty-first century, the perception of Europe in Asia and of Asia in Europe is changing dramatically, as Asia's economies boom while the European Union finds itself mired in a crisis of identity and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Prominent Asians, such as former Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew, are now warning Europeans that if they continue on their current course, Europe will rapidly become irrelevant for anything other than tourism and high-end real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A prominent Chinese businessman who divides his time between Hong-Kong and London was even more specific.</seg>
		<seg id="7">At a private gathering of top business and political leaders in Paris a few weeks ago, he said, &quot;You Europeans are becoming a Third World country, you spend time on the wrong subjects -- the constitution, the welfare state, the pensions crisis -- and you systematically give the wrong answers to the questions you raise.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">Europeans' views of Asia in general, and China in particular, are more complex and swing from lucid adjustment to a new and respected competitor to pure ideological rejection.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In May 1968, in France, the students -- or some of them, at least -- who took to the streets to invent a new world were dreaming of Maoist China, a China in the midst of the brutal and senseless Cultural Revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Their absurd and baroque infatuation was as much the product of ignorance of Mao's crimes as it was the result of boredom in a prosperous society where unemployment was virtually nonexistent.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Today, by contrast, their heirs are openly criticizing the Asian capitalist model.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Yesterday China was an anti-capitalist lodestar for utopian revolutionaries; today it has become an ultra-liberal nemesis for a new generation of utopian reactionaries -- the defenders of the status quo in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The student demonstrators in the streets of Paris recently don't want to become like Chinese and Indians; they reject the logic of globalization and refuse to surrender hard-won social guarantees.</seg>
		<seg id="14">European economic elites perceive China and India very differently.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They are now fully aware that their slightly nostalgic post-colonial view of these countries as large export markets and deep reservoirs of cheap labor has become outdated.</seg>
		<seg id="16">China and India have become genuine competitors who deserve respect, if not sheer awe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Quality, costs, and delivery times in auto manufacturing, for example, are reaching the European level.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Europe retains an advantage in terms of pure science, as in the pharmaceutical industry, but emerging world-class companies, particularly in India, are increasingly able to recruit M.I.T. and Harvard graduates, while maintaining lower labor costs and thus global competitiveness.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Unfortunately, although European leaders recognize the Asian challenge, they have failed to use it as a reality test in the irresistible process of globalization and as a call to arms in social and economic terms.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, it would be fair to say that European politicians, with few exceptions, such as Tony Blair, have been slow to adjust their worldviews in accordance with the revolutionary pace of change in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Caught between their lack of long-term strategic vision and their obsession with short-term interests, Europe's political leaders have largely failed to win the respect of their Asian counterparts, in contrast to European companies, which are faring much better in Asian eyes.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of course, on a continent that has largely failed to bury its past and close the door to nationalist ghosts, the EU is also often regarded by Asians as a model of reconciliation, peace, and prosperity.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But if Europe's performance continues to decline, would this perception survive?</seg>
		<seg id="24">Perhaps Asians would then come to regard the European model as a political version of Venice -- a place to visit with nostalgia for its past glory and admiration for its museum-like quality.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Red and the Blue</seg>
		<seg id="1">Condoleeza Rice's replacement of Colin Powell as US Secretary of State shows that America's recent presidential election continues to produce powerful reverberations.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But understanding what that election tells us about America is important not only for Americans, but for the world.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This year's presidential vote proves that America's democracy is healthy, but that some things could be better.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes.</seg>
		<seg id="5">While some Democrats remain bitter, there is little serious questioning of the legitimacy of Bush's victory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">America remains closely divided into red states (Republican) and blue states (Democrat).</seg>
		<seg id="7">If 100,000 votes changed in the red state of Ohio, John Kerry would be the president (albeit with a minority of the popular vote).</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Electoral College was included in America's constitution to protect small states in a federal system, but it now means that the political campaign focuses largely on the dozen or so battleground states where public opinion is closely divided.</seg>
		<seg id="9">More fundamentally, there is something unseemly about electing presidents without a popular majority.</seg>
		<seg id="10">So it is time for a serious debate about amending the constitution to abolish the Electoral College.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Some observers also complain about the divisive negative rhetoric and advertising that characterized the campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But this should be seen in historical perspective.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In the era of the Founding Fathers, newspapers were extremely partisan, and George Washington was dismayed by the harshness of political language.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For much of its early history -- to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction -- the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At the same time, despite negative advertising by both sides, the three nationally televised debates raised important issues in a serious format and were widely viewed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In general, an incumbent president with a growing economy is likely to be re-elected.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In that sense, what was surprising about Bush's re-election was how thin his majority was.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In large part, this was because of the unpopularity of the Iraq War.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Kerry tried to make the war, the low rate of job creation, inadequate healthcare, and Bush's tax cuts for upper income groups the central issues of the campaign, but some observers felt that this never added up to a clear message.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Bush countered with concerns about security against terrorism and cultural populism on issues such as gay marriage and abortion rights.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In the end, security and cultural populism trumped economic populism.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Interpretation of the election has been influenced by exit polls in which voters were asked (after they voted) about which issues mattered most to them.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The largest number (22%) answered &quot;moral values,&quot; comparison to 20% who cited the economy and 19% who mentioned terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But a Pew poll taken a week after the election indicated that the category &quot;moral values&quot; encompassed a wide range of issues besides abortion rights and gay marriage.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In fact, polls show that 25% of the public support gay marriage and 35% favor legal civil unions for gay couples (the position advocated by Kerry).</seg>
		<seg id="27">Nonetheless, for the 37% who oppose gay marriage, particularly in the red center of the country, the issue helped mobilize Bush supporters to come to vote.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A larger question is whether the US is hopelessly divided.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The election map of red and blue states has given rise to Internet jokes and cartoons about the two blue coasts seceding from the red center of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Some call it &quot;Coastopia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the division is not that sharp.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Many states in both camps were won by narrow margins, and if one colors the map at the level of counties rather than states, much of the country looks quite purple.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Cities versus suburbs and rural areas is a better description than coasts versus heartland.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Indeed, public opinion polls show that most Americans are clustered in the moderate center of the political spectrum rather than at the two extremes.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">At first, this seems puzzling, because they should have an incentive to move to the vote-rich middle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But many members of Congress represent districts that are safe for their parties, and the threat to their re-election comes in party primaries that are dominated by the more activist and extreme wings of the parties.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This tendency is reinforced by the rise of cable television, which attracts viewers by means of contentious &quot;infotainment&quot; programs, and Internet bloggers, who engage in fierce polemics with no editorial filter.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Reforms to alter the boundaries of Congressional districts to make them more competitive would help alleviate this problem, but few incumbent Congressmen will vote for changes that might increase their risk of defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The closeness of the result suggests Bush won less of a mandate for change than he seems to believe.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Faced with difficult questions in foreign, fiscal, and social policy, he would be wise to turn toward the center rather than conciliate his conservative base, but it remains unclear whether the politics of conviction or of pragmatism will prevail.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Kicking the Oil Habit</seg>
		<seg id="1">Chancellor Angela Merkel has made addressing climate change a high priority on Germany's agenda for its EU and G-8 presidencies that begin in January.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Here is a concrete proposal, one general enough for world leaders to consider and accept, and clear enough for other governments and businesses to grasp: simply set a date, at the next G-8 summit, by which oil-powered cars would no longer be licensed in major industrialized countries.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Such a decision would have a strongly positive economic and geopolitical impact.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The real cause of today's worries over energy is not the decline in world oil reserves, but rather that domestic oil production by the top consumers -- Europe, the United States, and China -- will decline at the very moment that growing Asian demand strains the market.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in all other regions will be depleted sooner.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Moreover, the main oil exporters are unwilling to subordinate their investment policies to market requirements.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Saudi Arabia seeks to run its oil production independently, while Iran scares off potential investors with bureaucratic hurdles and corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Iraq suffers from a lack of security, and foreign investors in Russia are thwarted at every turn.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Those four states contain half of the world's proven oil reserves and two-thirds of what could potentially be exported.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All this, not production costs, lies at the heart of high oil prices and the scramble for oil contracts in Central Asia and Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="11">To believe that high oil prices are good because they serve the environment ignores some basic facts of international politics.</seg>
		<seg id="12">First, in many of the poorest African and Asian countries, oil imports account for a significantly higher share of national expenditure than in industrialized countries, which means that economic growth and social development are being imperiled, while new debt crises loom.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rents from oil production impede reforms in the major exporting countries.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Thanks to their lubricated financial strength, regimes like those in Venezuela and Iran increasingly feel unconstrained by international rules.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Latecomers among consuming nations, such as China, mimic the former habits of the industrialized West, with their long record of overlooking human rights abuses in order to secure lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil-rich regimes.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Only the world's political and economic heavyweights, the main industrialized countries that remain by far the biggest consumers of hydrocarbons, can initiate change on a global scale.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Change must begin in the transport sector, which accounts for more than half of current oil consumption -- a share that is likely to rise in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The G-8 countries should therefore agree to no longer license any new, oil-powered cars from 2025 onwards.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This decision would not be directed against individual mobility, but against the dissipation of a scarce resource that is more urgently needed to produce synthetic materials.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Political leaders should not privilege any particular technology.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Instead, they should provide the automobile industry with incentives to develop alternative technologies that rely on bio-mass fuel, ethylene, hydrogen, and even natural gas during a transition period.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Countries that lead the way politically will, as a collateral benefit, provide domestic industries with a leading position in energy technology, ensuring future markets.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The expected significant reduction of CO2-emissions could eventually bring about the breakthrough that is needed in international climate policies.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But economic development comes into play as well: curing our &quot;addiction&quot; to oil would leave more of it to poorer, less developed, and newly industrializing countries, as well as pushing down prices and easing geopolitical energy competition.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Geopolitically, the benefits would similarly obvious, as the ability of major oil exporters to blackmail industrialized countries would be significantly reduced.</seg>
		<seg id="26">This could increase the bargaining power of the international community in the Middle East, and might strengthen those social forces in countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Russia that seriously wish to promote political and economic reform from within.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a technologically advanced and major automobile-producing country, Germany is well placed to bring about such an initiative.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Merkel, who holds a doctorate in physics and started her political career as an environment minister -- presiding in 1995 over the first conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change -- may have more credibility in addressing the issue than any of her EU and G-8 colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Now is the time for a bold act of leadership.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Trade-and-Aid Myth</seg>
		<seg id="1">Trade and aid have become international buzzwords.</seg>
		<seg id="2">More aid (including debt relief) and greater access to rich countries' markets for poor countries' products now appears to be at the top of the global agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, the debate nowadays is not about what to do, but how much to do, and how fast.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Lost in all this are the clear lessons of the last five decades of economic development.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Foremost among these is that economic development is largely in the hands of poor nations themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Countries that have done well in the recent past have done so through their own efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Aid and market access have rarely played a critical role.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Consider a developing country that has free and preferential market access to its largest neighbor, which also happens to be the world's most powerful economy.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Suppose, in addition, that this country is able to send millions of its citizens to work across the border, receives a huge volume of inward investment, and is totally integrated into international production chains.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Moreover, the country's banking system is supported by its rich neighbor's demonstrated willingness to act as a lender of last resort.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Globalization does not get much better than this, right?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Now consider a second country.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This one faces a trade embargo in the world's largest market, receives neither foreign aid nor any other kind of assistance from the West, is excluded from international organizations like the WTO, and is prevented from borrowing from the IMF and the World Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If these external disadvantages are not debilitating enough, this economy also maintains its own high barriers on international trade (in the form of state trading, import tariffs, and quantitative restrictions). </seg>
		<seg id="15">As the reader may have guessed, these are real countries: Mexico and Vietnam.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mexico shares a 2,000-mile long border with the United States, which provides not only privileged market access in goods and labor, but also a claim to the resources of the US Treasury (as became apparent during the 1995 peso crisis).</seg>
		<seg id="17">By contrast, America maintained a trade embargo against Vietnam until 1994, established diplomatic relations only in 1995, and did not provide most-favored nation treatment to Vietnamese imports for years after that.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Vietnam still remains outside the WTO.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Now consider their economic performance.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Since NAFTA was signed in December 1992, Mexico's economy has grown at an average annual rate of barely over 1% in per capita terms.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This is not only far below the rates of Asia's economic superstars; it is also a fraction of Mexico's own growth performance during the decades that preceded the debt crisis of 1982 (3.6% per year between 1960 and 1981).</seg>
		<seg id="22">Vietnam, however, grew at an annual rate of 5.6% per capita between the onset of its economic reforms in 1988 and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US in 1995, and has continued to grow at a rapid 4.5% pace since then.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Vietnam witnessed a dramatic fall in poverty, while in Mexico real wages fell.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Both countries experienced sharp increases in international trade and foreign investment, but the pictures are utterly different where it counts most: rising standards of living, particularly for the poor.</seg>
		<seg id="25">What these examples show is that domestic efforts trump everything else in determining a country's economic fortunes.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the opportunities that the US market presented to Mexico could not offset the consequences of policy mistakes at home, especially the failure to reverse the real appreciation of the peso's exchange rate and the inability to extend the productivity gains achieved in a narrow range of export activities to the rest of the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">What matters most is whether a country adopts the right growth strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="28">With none of Mexico's advantages, Vietnam pursued a strategy that focused on diversifying its economy and enhancing the productive capacity of domestic suppliers.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Broader post-war experience supports the conclusion that domestic policies are what matter most.</seg>
		<seg id="30">South Korea took off in the early 1960's not when foreign aid was at its apex, but when it was being phased out.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Taiwan did not receive foreign aid or preferential market access.</seg>
		<seg id="32">China and India, today's two economic superstars, have prospered largely through sui generis reform efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It is tempting to ascribe the rare African successes -- Botswana and Mauritius -- to foreign demand for their exports (diamonds and garments, respectively), but that story goes only so far.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Obviously, both countries would be considerably poorer without access to foreign markets.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But, as in other cases of successful development, what distinguishes them is not the external advantages they possess, but their ability to exploit these advantages.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Witness the mess that other countries made of their natural-resource endowments.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The word &quot;diamond&quot; hardly conjures images of peace and prosperity in Sierra Leone.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Similarly, few of the export processing zones proliferating around the world have delivered the results observed in Mauritius. </seg>
		<seg id="39">None of this absolves rich countries of their responsibility to help.</seg>
		<seg id="40">They can make the world less hospitable for corrupt dictators -- for example, by greater sharing of financial information and by not recognizing the international contracts that they sign.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Similarly, increasing the number of poor-country workers allowed to work in rich countries, and providing greater scope for growth-oriented policies by relaxing WTO rules and conditionality from the US, would produce greater long-term development impact.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It is far from clear that expanding market access and boosting aid are the most productive use of valuable political capital in the North.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Development should focus not on trade and aid, but on improving the policy environment in poor countries.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Who's Dependent Now?</seg>
		<seg id="1">If the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today, he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down.</seg>
		<seg id="2">His hugely influential &quot;dependency&quot; theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports, they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Instead, they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever-dwindling income shares.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Prebisch's preferred policy response, protectionism, proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the fact is that for many years, Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long-term commodity price trends.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities, especially during the 1980's and 1990's.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With few exceptions, countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally, whereas many resource-poor Asian countries raced ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today, however, with Asia's giants, India and China, joining the global economy, prices for oil, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding.</seg>
		<seg id="9">While there will always be cycles -- oil prices, for example, will probably fall before they start rising again -- the long-run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet, though Prebisch would have realized it instantly, is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Indeed, perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The questions are many.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Are today's rich countries prepared for an era of co-dependency, in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology?</seg>
		<seg id="14">Are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier?</seg>
		<seg id="15">How will the world's two superpowers, China and the United States, come to terms with the fact that important commodity-exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill-formed nation states?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some self-anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources, with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nowadays, there are many adherents of the &quot;Hubbert's peak&quot; theory of oil production, which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity, the wells are running dry, and it is all downhill from here.</seg>
		<seg id="18">However, as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out, prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Each time, radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In the late 1800's, oil extraction involved dredging with a mule.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Today, no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor.</seg>
		<seg id="22">There have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture.</seg>
		<seg id="23">No, the world is not about to run out of commodities.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Instead, what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people (China and India alone) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset.</seg>
		<seg id="25">So, for at least the next 50 to 75 years, and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries, prices for many natural resources are headed up.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics?</seg>
		<seg id="27">World War I, of course, was partly set off by Germany's concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Similarly, in World War II, Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Will similar tensions arise between resource-challenged China (where even water scarcity is a problem) and the West?</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fortunately, this does not seem likely for the moment, especially given the Chinese leadership's sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Chinese are looking to regions like Africa, hoping to find stable trading partners.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who don't just want to trade with commodity exporters, but to convert them as well.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self-sufficient in energy supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But this is basically a joke: self-indulgent, maybe, but self-sufficient, never.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="36">If they are right, one can only hope that America has a plan B.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Meanwhile, commodity prices will continue to rise, with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America's gaping trade deficit.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity-exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy!</seg>
		<seg id="39">That is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Iran's Hardline Choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">Iran's choice for its next president, the hardline Mayor of Teheran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is likely to worsen relations with the West and the country's international isolation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yet in domestic terms the Islamist regime is likely to be better off than it would have been with a more moderate result.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Clearly, Ahmadinejad has a real base of support.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But the fact that he ran as a populist, talked about helping the poor, condemned the government's performance, and acted almost like an opposition candidate are all irrelevant: he was the regime's choice, and, in the end, he received official help even against rival hardline candidates.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The regime played its hand brilliantly.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It turned the slightly more pragmatic Hashemi Rafsanjani, who disagreed with some current policies, into the &quot;establishment&quot; figure and its own man into the rebel.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The government thus used anti-establishment feeling to revitalize its own rule.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Given the fact that the last president, Muhammad Khatami, was a supporter of the reform movement -- albeit a timid one who ultimately accomplished nothing -- only underlines how thoroughly the rulers turned around the political situation.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Ahmadinejad is a representative of the younger activists in the anti-Shah revolution of a quarter-century ago.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He was directly involved in the holding of American hostages in Iran, though exactly how much so remains a matter of dispute.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Most worrisome of all, he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij organization.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The first is a parallel pro-regime army; the second is an organization for intimidating opponents and anyone seeking a more open society.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, concern that an even more radical leadership has taken over in Iran is mitigated by two factors.</seg>
		<seg id="14">First, Ahmadinejad is more likely to focus on domestic issues, trying -- with whatever degree of success is unclear -- to improve living standards for the poorest Iranians.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Second, the same group that has been in control ever since the revolution will basically continue to run ideological and foreign policy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The president has fewer powers than it seems, overshadowed particularly by Supreme Guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, Ahmadinejad's election starkly clarifies the challenge that Iran poses for Western policy and Middle East stability.</seg>
		<seg id="18">First and foremost, it sends a signal to the most extreme elements in Iran and that country's terrorist clients -- Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and various small groups operating against Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Arab countries -- that they have a green light for launching attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="19">They are likely to assume that Iran will support them whatever they do.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Outwardly, Iran has often been relatively cautious, but, at the covert level, it has been the world's leading sponsor of terror.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Sometimes individual Iranian officials may have acted on their own to order and coordinate specific operations; they will now feel freer to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Moreover, Ahmadinejad openly advocates Iran's crash program to obtain nuclear weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Most Iranian politicians -- at least those allowed by the government to function openly -- support the program, but favor a quieter and more cautious approach.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Rafsanjani, for example, put building better economic relations with the West ahead of pushing forward on the nuclear front.</seg>
		<seg id="25">If Ahmadinejad is president of a nuclear Iran, he is more likely to use the weapons in an adventurous manner.</seg>
		<seg id="26">This does not mean that he would fire them, but rather that he would use them for purposes of diplomatic blackmail, raising threats to crisis levels.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Since Iranian leaders daily proclaim their desire to wipe Israel off the map and to fight the US (Ahmadinejad stepped on a picture of an American flag on his way to vote), the risk of confrontation has increased.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Finally, Ahmadinejad is likely to be bolder in subverting stability in Iraq, and his victory will encourage radical Iranian officials and extremists within Iraq itself.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Iran is already sending many agents into Iraq and supporting clients seeking to turn that country into a clone.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Iraqis, including Shia Muslims -- who follow the same version of Islam as Iranians — generally reject such interference.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A more militant Iranian posture is likely to increase friction with Iraq, as well as inspire more anti-American violence there.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In short, Iran's electoral outcome is a dangerous one, though precisely how destabilizing it ultimately turns out to be will depend on Ahmadinejad's actions and the degree of power granted him by Khamenei.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Moreover, dealing with such an openly extreme Iran -- radical even by the hardline regime's standards -- will be a challenge not just for the US, but for Europe as well.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Will European countries try to pretend that Ahmadinejad's militant rhetoric and provocations don't matter and that some diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear ambition can be found?</seg>
		<seg id="35">With Rafsanjani, either a real agreement or the pretense of cooperation would have been easy to maintain.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But, with Ahmadinejad, a high level of appeasement will be necessary for even the most minimal diplomatic process to continue.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Some Iranian reformers and exiles put a bright face on Ahmadinejad's election, arguing that his administration is more likely to show the regime's real face and disabuse any Western hopes of compromise.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Yet it may also represent the regime's success at co-opting dissatisfaction with a quarter-century of radical Islamist rule.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Whatever the outcome, for the West, Ahmadinejad's victory means that everything related to Iran is set to become even hotter.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Take From the Poor, Give to the Rich</seg>
		<seg id="1">President Bush seems poised to wreck America's budget for years to come.</seg>
		<seg id="2">When Bush came into office, the outlook was for budget surpluses as far as the eye could see.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Today, through a combination of irresponsible Republican-led tax cuts, a slowing economy, the bursting of the stock market bubble, and a massive increase in defense spending, huge deficits dominate the fiscal horizon.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Worse is coming, because the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress are preparing to deepen the fiscal mess.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The damage they will do will likely weaken the US and add instability to the world economy.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Traditionally, America's Republican Party stood for balanced budgets.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This changed with the Reagan Administration, when conservative Republicans favored tax cuts even at the cost of large budget deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="8">President Reagan told the American people that they could enjoy tax cuts, a military build-up, and continuation of their favorite spending programs all at the same time.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The result - no surprise - was a series of vast budget deficits that took years to clean up.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Both President George Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton had to raise taxes to clean up the Reagan-era mess.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Those tax increases probably contributed to President Bush Sr's defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Yet Clinton bravely decided to complete the process of restoring fiscal balance, in part to protect the long-term financing of the Social Security retirement program.</seg>
		<seg id="13">When Clinton left office in 2000, the budget situation was the best in decades.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then along came President George Bush Jr. to replay Reagan: large tax cuts, a big increase in military spending, and continuation or even expansion of popular spending programs.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The result was predictable.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In January 2001, the cumulative budget outcome for the years 2002-2011 was projected to be $5.6 trillion dollars in surplus.</seg>
		<seg id="17">By mid-2002, those projected surpluses had vanished.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In view of these changed economic conditions, and the shadow of war in Iraq, you might expect the Bush Administration and the Republican-led Congress to be cautious in advocating new tax cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But no, their highest priority is to enact more tax cuts that will mainly benefit the rich.</seg>
		<seg id="20">At the same time, the Administration is calling for big increases in military spending.</seg>
		<seg id="21">With the November 2004 presidential election now coming into view, you can be certain that no meaningful cuts in non-military spending programs will be made.</seg>
		<seg id="22">So massive budget deficits seem here to stay.</seg>
		<seg id="23">If domestic spending simply stays constant as a fraction of national income, the cumulative budget outcome for the next ten years will be a combined deficit of $1.5 trillion.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But this figure may be optimistic, because it probably doesn't adequately factor in the costs of a possible war in Iraq, nor another round of tax cuts, nor the risk of higher interest rates in the years ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Why are Republicans so unconcerned about this mess?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Some Republican care more about tax cuts for the rich than they do about almost anything else.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Others believe that deficits will force major cuts in domestic government spending, thus shrinking the state, which is their heart's desire.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The problem with this latter view is that most taxpayers like domestic programs, and will not readily support major spending cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="29">A more intriguing question is why do Americans vote for such policies, when they should know that trouble will probably result.</seg>
		<seg id="30">One answer is that many voters do not see the looming budget troubles.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A better answer is that most Americans did not actually vote for these policies.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Voter turnout in the 2002 election was only around 40%, of which around half went to the Republicans, or around 20% of eligible voters.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Of course, the outlook need not be so bleak.</seg>
		<seg id="34">War in Iraq may be avoided.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Proposed tax cuts may be watered down or abandoned.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But I predict large budget deficits for years to come, and a growing sense of unease within the US and abroad about America's macroeconomic situation.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Foreign investors may decide to cut back financing America's budget and current account deficits on favorable terms.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The dollar may weaken, and fears of inflation may become more pronounced.</seg>
		<seg id="39">All of this will make US policymakers less confident and less flexible in their responses to economic shocks.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The poor, both inside the US and abroad, could suffer the most, as President Bush and the Congress tell the American people and the world that, due to the large budget deficits, there is no money available to address problems of poverty, disease, and education.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Unless ordinary Americans wake up to these fiscal risks, the rich may walk away with another multi-billion-dollar gift as the country and the world bear the harsh consequences for years to come.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Lessons from America's Fiscal Recklessness</seg>
		<seg id="1">George W. Bush has done more to wreck US economic policy than any other President in American history, exceeding even his mentor, Ronald Reagan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In just three years in office, he has destroyed a fragile political consensus that had taken a decade to construct, and that could take another decade to re-create.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In doing so, Bush has risked America's long-term economic health and social stability.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Because the long-term budgetary challenges that the US is so badly mismanaging are not unique, America's fiscal blunders provide important lessons for other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The main problem with fiscal policy is that politicians can easily make themselves temporarily popular by cutting taxes and increasing public spending while running up massive public debts, leaving repayment to the future.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This trick can last a few years, but sooner rather than later budget deficits and growing public debt force a painful policy reversal.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Yet a cynical politician can buy himself re-election and perhaps be in retirement when the crisis arrives.</seg>
		<seg id="8">One would imagine that after hundreds of such episodes of fiscal irresponsibility around the world in recent decades, voters would be allergic to such tricks.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Yet Bush is doing it again, buying popularity today by doling out massive tax cuts while simultaneously increasing military spending and even raising expenditure on education and health.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The result is a budget deficit equivalent to more than 5% of GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">What's worse is that America's long-term budgetary prospects were already troubling before Bush began his reckless policies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The US population is aging, so there will be a sharp increase in the costs of publicly funded health care and pension systems.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Careful calculations show that future revenues under the tax policies favored by Bush are likely to fall tens of trillions of dollars short of the costs of public pensions, health care, and other fiscal spending expected by the public.</seg>
		<seg id="14">At some point in the future, there will thus need to be steep increases in tax collections, sharp cuts in public spending, or both, to correct Bush's actions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So why does the public support his policies?</seg>
		<seg id="16">Because the public has little understanding or concern about these long-term consequences, even though they will eventually hurt most Americans.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The richest taxpayers are, of course, happy because they received the bulk of the tax cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Amazingly, the richest 5% of US taxpayers received almost half of the tax cuts, and these rich taxpayers clearly expect the other 95%--the middle class and the poor--to bear most of the future spending cuts and tax increases.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Meanwhile, Bush has convinced many poor and middle-class voters that they should be happy, too, without telling them that they will have to pay for their small tax cuts with much larger cuts in future government services if his administration's policies prevail in the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="20">If Americans had a political memory, they would understand that they already rode this fiscal &quot;roller coaster&quot; once in the past 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Ronald Reagan also came to office promising massive tax cuts and large increases in military spending.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The result was a huge budget deficit by the middle of the 1980's.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Tax cuts made Reagan enormously popular and helped win him re-election in 1984.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It then took over a decade--starting in Reagan's second term, and continuing through the terms of George Bush, Sr. and Bill Clinton--to get the budget back to surplus.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Of course, this meant approving fresh tax increases, which cost George Bush, Sr. his re-election and led to the polarized politics of the 1990's.</seg>
		<seg id="26">History will almost certainly repeat.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some right-wing ideologues in the Bush administration believe that today's budget deficits will eventually force government social spending to be cut sharply.</seg>
		<seg id="28">They hope to dismantle programs such as Social Security and Medicare.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But the US public strongly supports these social programs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">So the right-wing strategy of cutting taxes first in order to force cuts in social programs later will fail, and eventually tax rates will have to rise.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Others in the Bush administration argue that tax cuts are important for pulling the US out of recession.</seg>
		<seg id="32">This argument is also mistaken.</seg>
		<seg id="33">America's economy could have recovered without the tax cuts, and perhaps even more robustly.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In any event, it is a huge mistake to base long-term tax policies on the short-run business cycle.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There are two vital lessons for other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The first is that the looming US budget deficits will sooner or later limit America's international power.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Americans supported the Iraq war only because they didn't have to pay for it with increased taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="38">When Americans are forced to choose between foreign adventures and higher taxes, they will be much less likely to support expensive military operations abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Indeed, the US will be deeply divided internally as the public grapples with the fiscal mess left by Bush.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The second lesson is that countries ought to plan their budgets taking into account the rising fiscal costs of an aging population.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Long-term budgetary conditions are rarely in clear view of taxpayers or the parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Governments should be required to submit long-term budget assessments together with their annual budget proposals, in order to reduce the tendency towards short-run political manipulation of the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The US can serve as an early warning to other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The White House ought to provide others with the same caveat that magicians on television give their viewers: &quot;Do not try this at home.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Political Stock Market</seg>
		<seg id="1">Many economic and financial analysts complain that emerging countries' stock markets are often heavily manipulated by their governments and are more political than economic.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The unstated assumption seems to be that, in contrast, some pristine force of economic nature drives stock markets in advanced countries, and that forecasting their performance is thus like forecasting the growth of trees.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, the best analysts know that forecasting the performance of any country's stock market substantially means forecasting how well the government wants stock market investors to fare in the current political environment.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Consider the United States stock market, by far the world's largest.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The general perception is that the government leaves companies alone and that the returns from investing in the US stock market reflect the fundamental forces of a strong capitalist economy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This is one reason why the US is a magnet for portfolio investors from around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But the returns that make US stock markets so attractive reflect a delicate political balance.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In particular, tax rates that affect stocks have varied through time as political pressures change.</seg>
		<seg id="10">During World War II, for example, political support for great fortunes diminished and the government sharply increased taxes on capital gains, dividends, and high incomes in general.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When World War II produced a strong recovery from the Great Depression of the 1930's, President Roosevelt and Congress slapped on an excess-profits tax to ensure that shareholders would not benefit too much.</seg>
		<seg id="12">By contrast, in 1980, when there was no war but the stock market was low, US voters elected Ronald Reagan, a man many thought too right wing to be president.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He asked for - and got - cuts in capital gains, dividend, and income taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Property taxes, excise taxes, import duties, and sales taxes - all of which are paid, directly or indirectly, by corporations - can have a magnified impact on corporate profits, and hence on the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is no coincidence that wherever stock markets thrive, governments take care that these taxes stop well short of destroying after-tax corporate profits.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Indeed, the politics of stock markets does not stop with taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">On the contrary, almost every activity of government has an impact on corporate profits, and in turn, on the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="19">After the 1929 stock market crash the US government suspended much anti-trust activity, allowing companies to acquire monopoly power that would boost their value.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This policy delayed the recovery from high unemployment, but even that was not enough to rein in the political forces arrayed in favor of supporting the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Similarly, one of the most important things that President Reagan did was to destroy much of the remaining power of America's labor unions, which compete for their share of the corporate pie.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Reagan's defeat of the Air Traffic Controllers' strike in 1981 was a watershed event for the US labor movement - and for the stock market, which started its dramatic bull market in 1982.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The US government has been particularly aggressive in supporting the stock market since the peak of the equities price bubble in 2000, most notably cutting interest rates repeatedly.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not supporting the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But it is a telling sign of the US stock market's significance that one of the most important factors perceived to be weighing on the economy was declining equity prices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Indeed, the authorities' response was not limited to monetary stimulus.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The US National Income and Product Accounts show that the effective rate of corporate profits tax (the percentage of profits actually paid to the government in taxes) crested at 33.7% in the first quarter of 2000 - the peak of the stock market and the economy in general - and fell to 20.2% in the fourth quarter of 2003, when the market was down.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Much of that decline reflects explicit tax relief measures voted by Congress, as well as the perception among corporations that in the current economic and political environment they can be more aggressive in tax avoidance.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Moreover, after the stock market crash, the maximum tax on dividends paid on stocks was slashed from 35% to 15%, giving a substantial new advantage to long-term investors and boosting the compounding effect of reinvesting after-tax dividends.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Again, this tax cut was justified in terms of stimulating the economy, which can, of course, be said of practically any measure aimed at supporting the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But it is the balance of political forces that determines whether such a justification will be credible.</seg>
		<seg id="32">One might say that the same variables, including hostility to high taxes and a weak labor movement, have operated in the US for the past 200 years - and can thus be expected to continue operating in the future, producing high stock market returns and attracting huge inflows of foreign investment.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Those who believe that investments in the US stock market will maintain the same strong growth trend for decades may well be right.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But one should be clear about what one is forecasting.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Global Home</seg>
		<seg id="1">Homes are the most local of investments, rooted to a particular place like a tree, and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The whole world flashes by on our television screens, but the market for our homes, which is comprised almost entirely of local amateurs, remains grounded right there in our own backyard.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Soon, however, this could all change.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Within a month, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in collaboration with my company, MacroMarkets, as well as Fiserv and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, will launch futures and options contracts on home prices in ten cities in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The contracts will be settled on the S&amp;amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, which developed out of academic work that my colleague Karl Case and I pioneered almost twenty years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For many years we have been campaigning for housing futures, but no exchange wanted to use such indices to create a futures market until now.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The futures markets on home prices will allow investors around the world to invest in US homes indirectly, by buying interests in them through these markets.</seg>
		<seg id="8">An investor in Paris, Rio de Janeiro, or Tokyo will be able to invest in owner-occupied homes in New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A fundamental principle of financial theory -- &quot;diversification&quot; or &quot;risk spreading&quot; -- implies that interest in the new contracts will be high.</seg>
		<seg id="10">People and businesses in New York, for example, are overexposed to their local real estate risks, so they should reduce this risk by selling New York home price futures.</seg>
		<seg id="11">People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The New Yorkers still live in their own homes, but now they have spread their investment risk worldwide.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A genuine futures market on single-family homes has not been attempted since 1991 when the London Futures and Options Exchange (now merged into Euronext.liffe) failed in its effort to launch such a market in Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="14">That attempt never generated much trading volume.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Exchange threw a party and no one came.</seg>
		<seg id="16">British spread-betting markets for home prices, and some retail online markets, have never amounted to much either.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Will it be different this time?</seg>
		<seg id="18">To be sure, starting a new market is always an uncertain proposition: people want to go to parties only if a lot of other people are there; if no one is there, no one wants to come.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Likewise, in markets without many investors, not enough trades can be executed to generate the returns needed to attract them.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As is often true of great parties, it can be a bit of a mystery how substantial new markets get started, but we know that it does happen from time to time.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Initial indications suggest growing interest in futures trading for home prices, particularly as so much talk about the &quot;housing bubble&quot; underscores the importance of diversifying risk.</seg>
		<seg id="22">After the CME's announcement, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions, to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But, aside from strong public interest in investing in housing and in hedging housing risks, another critical issue must be resolved if futures markets are to succeed: prices must be revealed, and investors must understand what these prices mean.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I believe there is a very good chance that many of these futures markets will soon be predicting substantial price declines in some US cities over the next year.</seg>
		<seg id="25">They will be in what traders call &quot;backwardation&quot;: the future price in the market today is lower than the price of a home today.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Maybe backwardation won't appear on the first day that housing futures are traded, but there is a good chance it will come within a matter of months.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We may need backwardation in some of these markets if they are to fulfill their function.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Everyone knows that there has been a huge real estate boom in many of these cities (and elsewhere in the world) in recent years.</seg>
		<seg id="29">International investors are not likely to want to invest in these cities unless expectations of a price decline are built into the futures markets, as people in Tokyo understand from their own bitter experience.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But if backwardation is strong enough, even investors who think that the US housing market is headed for a fall will still be able to expect a good return from home price futures, because they are already getting a discounted price in the futures market.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nevertheless, it will require some adjustment for New Yorkers seeking to hedge their own real estate investments to sell futures contracts that have a built-in price decline.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They will have to get used to the idea that the market already expects the decline, and that they can protect themselves only for that margin of possible future price declines that exceed this expectation.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In fact, such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Until now, the future course of real estate prices has been merely a matter of diverse opinion.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When markets create an international consensus on the future price of homes in cities around the world, we will be better able to manage the risks facing these cities, thereby stabilizing their economies -- and our own lives.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What News Is Moving the Markets?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Stock markets in much of the world have shown sharp cumulative declines since around May 10, with most of the drop occurring in the two-week period to around May 23, but with prices continuing to fall on average since then.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Does trouble in the world's stock markets mean trouble for the world economy?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Let us look at the biggest declines.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Of the major countries' indexes, the biggest crash was in India, where stock prices fell 16.9% from May 10 to May 22.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The debacle on the other side of the globe was almost as big and the peaks and troughs were within a day or two of those in India: in Argentina, stock prices fell 16.1%, in Brazil, they fell 14.7%, and in Mexico, they fell 13.8%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">European markets also suffered large losses.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In Sweden, stock prices fell 15.2% between May 9 and May 22; over nearly the same period, prices fell 9.7% in Germany , 9.4% in France and the United Kingdom, and 9.3% in Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Likewise, in Asia, stock prices fell 11.5% in Korea, 9.3% in Hong Kong, and 8% in Japan from their respective peaks to troughs over very nearly the same time period.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Many commentators try to tie such events to developments the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But US stock prices fell only 5.2% between May 9 and May 24.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Nor does China appear to be behind the global decline, since stock prices there actually rose during this period.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Economists' standard explanation revolves around monetary policy.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In the wake of the great deflation scare of 2003, central banks around the world cut interest rates, setting off speculative booms in both stock and housing markets.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But now, according to this view, rising interest rates are beginning to bite, which portends further declines in asset prices.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is certainly an important element of truth in this argument.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The US Federal Reserve did indeed raise rates on May 10, and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, indicated then that there may be further rate increases in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Worsening US inflation data were reported on May 17, suggesting that further monetary tightening is in store.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Economists like to view the world as logical and manageable, which implies that they understand what is happening.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But, in doing so, they often exaggerate central banks' role.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Indeed, the US rate increase was just one in a series of rate hikes -- the 16th in a row.</seg>
		<seg id="21">No other major central bank raised rates after the stock market drops began in May until June 7- 8, when several did (the European Central Bank, India, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey)</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another factor is the price of oil, which rose 24% from March 22 to May 2, setting all-time records along the way.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Surely, this was a major event that would plausibly affect stock markets all over the world.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Oil price increases have been a culprit in virtually every economic recession since World War II.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Still, the oil price increases do not correspond to the time interval in mid-May when stock market indexes fell most sharply.</seg>
		<seg id="26">To argue that oil price increases caused the stock market declines presupposes a time lag of several weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But stock markets are not very logical, and there could be a lagged response to the oil price shocks.</seg>
		<seg id="28">As with any other prices in financial markets, an increase attracts attention.</seg>
		<seg id="29">When oil prices rise quickly, people watch the news related to oil prices and talk to each other more about oil prices, hence creating heightened sensitivity to this news.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The crisis in the Middle East is tied to oil prices, and it dominated the news in May.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Ominous signs and strong language used by various political figures were possibly amplified in investors' minds by the oil price increases.</seg>
		<seg id="32">On May 8, Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres, reacting to hostile statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said that &quot;the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">Similarly, near the beginning of the May stock market tumble, Ahmadinejad visited Indonesia, the world's most populous country with a Muslim majority, and newspapers reported on May 13 that he had received a standing ovation from students at two of the country's top universities.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This story might have been interpreted as evidence that Ahmadinejad's brinkmanship on the nuclear issue was paying off for him politically, fueling a perception that the tense situation in the Middle East might lead to even higher oil prices.</seg>
		<seg id="35">These news stories may seem far more remote from the stock market than is monetary policy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">But public reaction to them, together with recent oil price increases, may well account in good measure for the change in market psychology.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Attitudes toward risks change over time, and events like Ahmadinejad's and Peres's remarks can precipitate such changes.</seg>
		<seg id="38">So, while these things happen in ways that are hard to quantify, maybe analysts should pay attention to the words of Ahmadinejad just as carefully as they do to those of Bernanke in trying to understand the direction of the world's stock markets.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Economists might not like to focus on the public mindset and how it interacts with price changes, world news stories, and speculative dynamics.</seg>
		<seg id="40">After all, doing so implies that economic events are less predictable (and economists less omniscient) than they like to imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But such a focus makes intuitive sense.</seg>
		<seg id="42">What is really on investors' minds?</seg>
		<seg id="43">Ahmadinejad is a charismatic figure; Bernanke is not.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Ahmadinejad is embarking on an adventure; Bernanke is not.</seg>
		<seg id="45">And, perhaps most importantly, Ahmadinejad is a destabilizing influence; Bernanke is not.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Indeed, whatever their ultimate cause, the mid-May drops in stock prices throughout the world are indicative of unstable market psychology.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It is difficult to believe that they were related only to opinions about likely monetary policy, and not to larger and deeper issues, including such things as energy and political tension, that underpin the performance of the world economy.

		<seg id="0">Why Pay More for Fairness?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain, recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea, totaling 38 lines, to Fairtrade, a marketing symbol of &quot;ethical production.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The announcement came during &quot;Fairtrade Fortnight,&quot; a two-week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries, telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well, as consumers increasingly turn to organic, locally produced foods, and eggs from hens not kept in cages.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the UK, a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is no comparable US research, but related data, and discussions with my own students, suggests that the figure would be much lower.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For example, the minimum price for coffee is $1.26 per pound, no matter how low the market price may fall.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Small farmers, for their part, are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages, comply with health, safety, and environmental standards, allow unions or other forms of workers' associations, provide good housing if workers are not living at home, and do not use child labor or forced labor.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Not every one approves of Fairtrade.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Brink Lindsey, director of the pro-market Cato Institute's Center for Trade Policy Studies, believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a &quot;well-meaning dead end.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">With some justification, he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals, but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam, combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In Lindsey's view, if we want to assist coffee growers, we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops -- and here he rightly points to rich nations' trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled -- or to move into higher-value products, like specialty coffees, that bring higher prices.</seg>
		<seg id="17">What is curious about Lindsey's argument, however, is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends -- encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Pro-market economists don't object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If people want to pay $48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that's what James Bond prefers, economists don't object that the market is being distorted.</seg>
		<seg id="20">So why be critical when consumers choose to pay $12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals, under shade trees that help birds to survive, by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children?</seg>
		<seg id="21">Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.</seg>
		<seg id="22">That's a possible strategy, but there are advantages to Fairtrade.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like, both for its taste and for the way it is grown.</seg>
		<seg id="24">If their product sells well, they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="25">From the growers' perspective, receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more &quot;anti-market&quot; than paying more for a Gucci label, and it reflects better ethical priorities.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Fairtrade is not a government subsidy.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Its success depends on market demand, not political lobbying.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Fortunately, in Europe, that market demand is growing rapidly.</seg>
		<seg id="30">One hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world, and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending.</seg>

		<seg id="4">This year, one of the issues on the ballot was an act to prohibit tethering or confining a pregnant pig, or a calf raised for veal, in a manner that prevents the animal from turning around freely, lying down, and fully extending his or her limbs.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Those who know little about modern factory farming may wonder why such legislation would be necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Under farming methods that were universal 50 years ago, and that are still common in some countries today, all animals have the space to turn around and stretch their limbs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, however, about 90% of US breeding sows -- the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork, bacon, and ham -- spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet (0.6 meters by 2.2 meters).</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are unable to turn around, lie down with their legs fully extended, or move more than a step forward or backward.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Other sows are kept on short tethers that also prevent them turning around.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Veal calves are similarly confined for all their lives in individual stalls that do not permit them to turn around, lie down, or stretch their limbs.</seg>
		<seg id="11">These methods are, essentially, labor-saving devices -- they make management of the animals easier and enable units with thousands or tens of thousands of animals to employ fewer and less skilled workers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">They also prevent the animals from wasting energy by moving around or fighting with each other.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Several years ago, following protests from animal welfare organizations, the European Union commissioned a report from its Scientific Veterinary Committee on these methods.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The committee found that animals suffer from being unable to move freely and from the total lack of anything to do all day.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Common sense would, of course, have reached the same conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Following the report, the EU set dates by which close confinement of these animals would be prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For veal calves, that date, January 1, 2007, is almost here.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Individual stalls for sows, already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned across the entire EU from 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Measures to improve the welfare of laying hens, which are typically kept crammed into bare wire cages with no room to stretch their wings, are also being phased in.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In the US, no such national measures are anywhere in sight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In the past, when my European friends have asked me why the US lags so far behind Europe in matters of animal welfare, I have had no answer.</seg>
		<seg id="22">When they pressed me, I had to admit that the explanation could be that Americans care less about animals than Europeans.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Then, in 2002, animal welfare advocates put a proposal to ban sow stalls on the ballot in Florida.</seg>
		<seg id="24">To the surprise of many, it gained the approval of 55% of those voting.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Last month in Arizona, despite well-funded opposition from agribusiness, the ban on small cages for sows and veal calves also passed, with 62% support.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Neither Florida nor Arizona are particularly progressive states -- both voted for George W. Bush over John Kerry in 2004.</seg>
		<seg id="27">So the results strongly suggest that if all Americans were given a chance to vote on keeping pregnant pigs and calves in such tight confinement, the majority would vote no.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Americans seem to care just as much about animal welfare as Europeans do.</seg>
		<seg id="29">So, to explain the gap between Europe and the US on farm animal welfare, we should look to the political system.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In Europe, the concerns of voters about animal welfare have been effective in influencing members of national parliaments, as well as members of the European Parliament, resulting in national legislation and EU directives that respond to those concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In the US, by contrast, similar concerns have had no discernible effect on members of Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="32">There is no federal legislation at all on the welfare of farm animals -- and very little state legislation, either.</seg>
		<seg id="33">That, I believe, is because agribusiness is able to put tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of congressional representatives seeking re-election.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The animal welfare movement, despite its broad public support, has been unable to compete in the arena of political lobbying and campaign donations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In US electoral politics, money counts for more than the opinions of voters.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Party discipline is weak, and Congressmen must themselves raise most of the money that they need for re-election -- and that happens every two years for members of the House of Representatives.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Europe, where party discipline is strong and the parties, not the individual candidates, finance election campaigns, money plays a smaller role.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In the US, a nation that prides itself on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What's New About the New All-Afghan Army?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The murder of Afghanistan's Minister of Aviation by a mob (perhaps incited by members of Afghanistan's own interim administration) shows that Afghan society remains deeply fissured.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The first reforms to Afghanistan's army will only make these divisions worse.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Minister of Defense in Hamid Karzai's temporary administration in Kabul has already named the top officers of this new army.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Minister, General Mohammed Fahim, is a Tajik from the Panjshir district in the North, who rose three months ago to command the Northern Alliance forces that captured Kabul after American bombers cleared the way for them.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As a group, his appointments pose a direct challenge to Mr. Karzai's goal of reunifying the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic nation, the largest group being Pashtuns, with two-fifths of the total.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hazaras and Tajiks constitute about a fifth each of the population.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Of thirty-eight officers elevated to general's rank by Mr. Fahim, thirty-seven are Tajiks, the other being Uzbek.</seg>
		<seg id="9">If any of the country's fifteen to seventeen million Pashtuns are recruited as soldiers, they will serve under a command structure made up almost entirely of Tajiks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Pashtuns' language, however, is as different from Tajik as Spanish is from English and millions of Pashtuns of military age know only a smattering of Tajik, at best.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The geographical profile of the new military leadership is as narrow as its ethnic makeup.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Thirty-five of the thirty-eight senior officers hail from one small area north of Kabul consisting of Parwan province (where the Bagram airport is located) and the nearby Panjshir valley, long the Northern Alliance's stronghold.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Stated differently, potential leaders from twenty-seven of Afghanistan's twenty-nine provinces were excluded from their country's new military elite.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Perhaps so narrow-based a group could overcome the impression that its members are a closed clique if they represented a broad cross-section of the country's dozen or more political parties.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But this is not the case.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Eighteen of the thirty-eight top brass come from one party, the Jamiat-e-Islami, the Islamic faction that has long been led by mullah and former theology professor Burhanuddin Rabbani.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It was this party that ruled Kabul briefly in the mid-1990s, creating the bloodshed and chaos that caused most Afghans to welcome the coming of the Taliban.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Almost equaling the number of Jamiat members in the army hierarchy are Communists.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Sixteen of the thirty-eight have long been aligned with this party, whose ploys in the late 1970s led to the Soviet invasion of 1979-89 which cost two-and-a-half million Afghan lives.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Most Afghans today view the Communists with the same degree of sympathy that Czechs or Poles reserve for Hitler's National Socialists.</seg>
		<seg id="21">True, people in Afghanistan, as elsewhere, joined the Communist Party for various reasons, and by no means were all of them hard-core ideologues.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But in the case of General Fahim's generals, six were professional Communist Party workers, and continued to serve the Party after the Red Army's invasion.</seg>
		<seg id="23">All six of these men, plus three more Communists who served as officers in the Afghan army, collaborated actively during the Soviet's decade-long occupation of Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Imagine how the French would have reacted if a quarter of France's post-World War II officer corps had sided with the Wehrmacht during its occupation of their country.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In Afghanistan news travels quickly by word of mouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Afghan nationalists (which includes nearly all Afghans) will soon discover the political backgrounds of members of General Fahim's inner circle, if they don't know already.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Even this overwhelming evidence of one-sidedness and bias in the formation of the new army's high command could be neutralized if the generals brought professionalism and commitment to the patriotic values of a truly national armed forces to their work.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Unfortunately, only ten of the thirty-eight brass promoted by Fahim have backgrounds as professional military officers.</seg>
		<seg id="29">An eleventh served as a pilot.</seg>
		<seg id="30">By contrast, twenty-four of the total (the backgrounds of the remaining four are unknown) come from civilian life, whether the professions, Communist Party offices, or in one case, a career as a mullah.</seg>
		<seg id="31">What do all these statistics mean in terms of day-to-day reality?</seg>
		<seg id="32">They mean that when the commanders of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, as well as American military and diplomatic officials, meet Afghanistan's Deputy Minister of Defense they will encounter Abdul Rashid Dostum, a notoriously brutal and corrupt warlord and Communist who keeps in touch with old Red Army friends still serving in Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It means that the Chief of the Afghan Armed Forces, as well as the Chief of Operations and the Chief of Army Intelligence are also Communists, men whose loyalties remain uncertain and are distrusted by most Afghans.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Is this a team likely to bring war-torn Afghanistan together?</seg>
		<seg id="35">Is the presence in Kabul of so dubious a crew likely to instill confidence in the three-quarters of Afghanistan's population who are shut out of the top army command?</seg>
		<seg id="36">Or is this list, rather, the harvest of a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; approach to governance that is bound (at some future point) to unleash another bloody national backlash by those whose legitimate interests have been cynically trampled?</seg>
		<seg id="37">UN, European, and American policymakers should ponder these questions before allowing themselves to acquiesce in a ruthless power grab by a small and unpopular minority.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Celebrating the Irrational</seg>
		<seg id="1">Three cheers for the new Nobel laureates in economics: Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University, and Vernon Smith of George Mason University in Virginia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Like many Nobel prizes, these awards recognize not only the seminal work undertaken by Kahneman and Smith, but also the schools of thought they help to lead.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Kahneman, a psychologist, has demonstrated how individuals systematically behave in ways less rational than orthodox economists believe they do.</seg>
		<seg id="4">His research shows not only that individuals sometimes act differently than standard economic theories predict, but that they do so regularly, systematically, and in ways that can be understood and interpreted through alternative hypotheses, competing with those utilized by orthodox economists.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To most market participants - and indeed, ordinary observers -- this does not seem like big news.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Wall Street brokers who peddled stocks they knew to be garbage exploited the irrationality that Kahneman and Smith exposed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Much of the mania that led to the bubble economy was based on exploiting investor psychology.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In fact, this irrationality is no news to the economics profession either.</seg>
		<seg id="9">John Maynard Keynes long ago described the stock market as based not on rational individuals struggling to uncover market fundamentals, but as a beauty contest in which the winner is the one who guesses best what the judges will say.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This year's Nobel prize celebrates a critique of simplistic market economics, just as last year's award (of which I was one of the three winners) did.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Last year's laureates emphasized that different market participants have different (and imperfect) information, and these asymmetries in information have profound impact on how an economy functions.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In particular, last year's laureates implied that markets were not, in general, efficient; that there was an important role for government to play.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Adam Smith's invisible hand -- the idea that free markets lead to efficiency as if by an invisible hand -- is invisible at least in part because it is not there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This, too, is not news to those who work day after day in the market (and make their fortunes by taking advantage of and overcoming asymmetries in information).</seg>
		<seg id="15">For more than twenty years economists were enthralled to so called &quot;rational expectations&quot; models which assumed that all participants have the same (if not perfect) information and act perfectly rationally, that markets are perfectly efficient, that unemployment never exists (except when caused by greedy unions or government minimum wages), and where there is never any credit rationing.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That such models prevailed, especially in America's graduate schools, despite evidence to the contrary bears testimony to a triumph of ideology over science.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Unfortunately, students of these graduate programs now act as policymakers in many countries, and are trying to implement programs based on the ideas that have come to be called market fundamentalism.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Let me be clear: the rational expectations models made an important contribution to economics; the rigor which its supporters imposed on economic thinking helped expose the weaknesses many underlying hypotheses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Good science recognizes its limitations, but the prophets of rational expectations have usually shown no such modesty.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Vernon Smith is a leader in the development of experimental economics, the idea that one could test many economic propositions in laboratory settings.</seg>
		<seg id="21">One reason that economics is such a difficult subject, and why there are so many disagreements among economists, is that economists cannot conduct controlled experiments.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Nature throws up natural experiments, but in most circumstances, so many things change so rapidly that it is often difficult to untangle what caused what.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In principle, in a laboratory, we can conduct controlled experiments, and therefore make more reliable inferences.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Critics of experimental economics worry that subjects bring to experimental situations modes of thought determined outside of the experiment, and thus that the experiments are not as clean and the inferences not as clear cut as in the physical sciences.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nonetheless, economic experiments provide insights into a number of important issues, such as the improved design of auctions.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Most importantly, the irrationality of market participants, which was the focus of Kahneman's work, has been verified repeatedly in laboratory contexts.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Among the more amusing results that have come out of experimental economics are those concerning altruism and selfishness.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It appears (at least in experimental situations) that experimental subjects are not as selfish as economists have hypothesized--except for one group - the economists themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Is it because economics as a discipline attracts individuals who are by nature more selfish or is it because economics helps shape individuals, making them more selfish?</seg>
		<seg id="30">The answer, almost certainly, is a little bit of both.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Presumably, future experimental research will help resolve the question of the relative importance of these two hypotheses.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The Nobel Prize signifies how important it is to study people and economies as they are, not as we want them to be.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Only by understanding better actual human behavior can we hope to design policies that will make our economies work better as well.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Bush's Bad-Faith Energy Policy</seg>
		<seg id="1">One of the more surreal sessions at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos had oil industry experts explaining how the melting of the polar ice cap -- which is occurring faster than anyone anticipated ­ -- represents not only a problem, but also an opportunity: vast amounts of oil may now be accessible.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Similarly, these experts concede that the fact that the United States has not signed the Law of the Sea, the international convention determining who has access to offshore oil and other maritime mineral rights, presents a risk of international conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But they also point to the upside: the oil industry, in its never-ending search for more reserves, need not beg Congress for the right to despoil Alaska.</seg>
		<seg id="4">President George W. Bush has an uncanny ability not to see the big message.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For years, it has become increasingly clear that much is amiss with his energy policy.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Scripted by the oil industry, even members of his own party referred to an earlier energy bill as one that &quot;left no lobbyist behind.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">While praising the virtues of the free market, Bush has been only too willing to give huge handouts to the energy industry, even as the country faces soaring deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is a market failure when it comes to energy, but government intervention should run in precisely the opposite direction from what the Bush administration has proposed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The fact that Americans do not pay the full price for the pollution -- especially enormous contributions to greenhouse gases -- that results from their profligate energy use means that energy is under-priced, in turn sustaining excessive consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The government needs to encourage conservation, and intervening in the price system ­­ -- namely, through taxes on energy -- is an efficient way to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But, rather than encouraging conservation, Bush has pursued a policy of &quot;drain America first,&quot; leaving America more dependent on external oil in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Never mind that high demand drives up oil prices, creating a windfall for many in the Middle East who are not among America's friends.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Now, more than four years after the terrorist attacks of September 2001, Bush appears to have finally woken up to the reality of America's increasing dependence; with soaring oil prices, it was hard for him not to note the consequences.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But, again, his administration's faltering moves will almost surely make matters worse in the immediate future.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Bush still refuses to do anything about conservation, and he has put very little money behind his continuing prayer than technology will save us.</seg>
		<seg id="16">What, then, to make of Bush's recent declaration of a commitment to make America 75% free of dependence on Middle East oil within 25 years.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For investors, the message is clear: do not invest more in developing reserves in the Middle East, which is by far the lowest-cost source of oil in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But, without new investment in developing Middle East reserves, unbridled growth of energy consumption in the US, China, and elsewhere implies that demand will outpace supply.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If that were not enough, Bush's threat of sanctions against Iran poses the risks of interruptions of supplies from one of the world's largest producers.</seg>
		<seg id="20">With world oil production close to full capacity and prices already more than double their pre-Iraq War level, this portends still higher prices, and still higher profits for the oil industry -- the only clear winner in Bush's Middle East policy.</seg>
		<seg id="21">To be sure, one shouldn't begrudge Bush for having at last recognized that there is a problem.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But, as always, a closer look at what he is proposing suggests another sleight of hand by his administration.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Aside from refusing to recognize the importance of global warming, encourage conservation, or devote enough funds to research to make a real difference, Bush's grandiose promise of a reduction of dependence on Middle East oil means less than it appears.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With only 20% of US oil coming from the Middle East, his goal could be achieved by a modest shift of sourcing elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But surely, one would think, the Bush administration must realize that oil trades on a global market.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Even if America were 100% independent of Middle East oil, a reduction in supply of Middle East oil could have devastating effects on the world price -- and on the American economy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As is too often the case with the Bush administration, there is no flattering explanation of official policy.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Is Bush playing politics by pandering to anti-Arab and anti-Iranian sentiment in America?</seg>
		<seg id="29">Or is this just another example of incompetence and muddle?</seg>
		<seg id="30">From what we have seen over the past five years, the correct answer probably contains more than a little bad faith and sheer ineptitude.</seg>

		<seg id="0">China's Roadmap</seg>
		<seg id="1">China is about to adopt its 11th five-year plan, setting the stage for the continuation of probably the most remarkable economic transformation in history, while improving the well-being of almost a quarter of the world's population.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Never before has the world seen such sustained growth; never before has there been so much poverty reduction.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Part of the key to China's long-run success has been its almost unique combination of pragmatism and vision.</seg>
		<seg id="4">While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, has been directed at a quixotic quest for higher GDP, China has once again made clear that it seeks sustainable and more equitable increases in real living standards.</seg>
		<seg id="5">China realizes that it has entered a phase of economic growth that is imposing enormous -- and unsustainable -- demands on the environment.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Unless there is a change in course, living standards will eventually be compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That is why the new five-year plan places great emphasis on the environment.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Even many of the more backward parts of China have been growing at a pace that would be a marvel, were it not for the fact that other parts of the country are growing even more rapidly.</seg>
		<seg id="9">While this has reduced poverty, inequality has been increasing, with growing disparities between cities and rural areas, and between coastal regions and the interior.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This year's World Bank World Development Report explains why inequality, not just poverty, should be a concern, and China's 11th five-year plan attacks the problem head-on.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The government has for several years talked about a more harmonious society, and the plan describes ambitious programs for achieving this.</seg>
		<seg id="12">China recognizes, too, that what separates less developed from more developed countries is not only a gap in resources, but also a gap in knowledge.</seg>
		<seg id="13">So it has laid out bold plans not only to reduce that gap, but to create a basis for independent innovation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">China's role in the world and the world's economy has changed, and the plan reflects this, too.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Its future growth will have to be based more on domestic demand than on exports, which will require increases in consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Indeed, China has a rare problem: excessive savings.</seg>
		<seg id="17">People save partly because of weaknesses in government social-insurance programs; strengthening social security (pensions) and public health and education will simultaneously reduce social inequalities, increase citizens' sense of well-being, and promote current consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="18">If successful -- and, so far, China has almost always surpassed even its own high expectations -- these adjustments may impose enormous strains on a global economic system that is already unbalanced by America's huge fiscal and trade imbalances.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If China saves less -- and if, as officials have announced, it pursues a more diversified policy of investing its reserves -- who will finance America's more than $2 billion a day trade deficit?</seg>
		<seg id="20">This is a topic for another day, but that day may not be far off.</seg>
		<seg id="21">With such a clear vision of the future, the challenge will be implementation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">China is a large country, and it could not have succeeded as it has without widespread decentralization.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But decentralization raises problems of its own.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Greenhouse gases, for example, are global problems.</seg>
		<seg id="25">While America says that it cannot afford to do anything about it, China's senior officials have acted more responsibly.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Within a month of the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline, and wood products were imposed: China was using market based mechanisms to address its and the world's environmental problems.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But the pressures on local government officials to deliver economic growth and jobs will be enormous.</seg>
		<seg id="28">They will be sorely tempted to argue that if America cannot afford to produce in a way that preserves our planet, how can we?</seg>
		<seg id="29">To translate its vision into action, the Chinese government will need strong policies, such as the environmental taxes already imposed.</seg>
		<seg id="30">As China has moved toward a market economy, it has developed some of the problems that have plagued the developed countries: special interests that clothe self-serving arguments behind a thin veil of market ideology.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Some will argue for trickle-down economics: don't worry about the poor, eventually everybody will benefit from growth.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And some will oppose competition policy and strong corporate governance laws: let Darwinian survival work its wonders.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Growth arguments will be advanced to counter strong social and environmental policies: higher gasoline taxes, for example, will kill our nascent auto industry.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Such allegedly pro-growth policies would not only fail to deliver growth; they would threaten the entire vision of China's future.</seg>
		<seg id="35">There is only one way to prevent this: open discussion of economic policies in order to expose fallacies and provide scope for creative solutions to the many challenges facing China today.</seg>
		<seg id="36">George W. Bush has shown the dangers of excessive secrecy and confining decision-making to a narrow circle of sycophants.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent to which its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) as they strive to solve the enormous problems they face.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Market economies are not self-regulating.</seg>
		<seg id="39">They cannot simply be left on autopilot, especially if one wants to ensure that their benefits are shared widely.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But managing a market economy is no easy task.</seg>
		<seg id="41">It is a balancing act that must constantly respond to economic changes.</seg>
		<seg id="42">China's 11th five-year plan provides a roadmap for that response.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The world watches in awe, and hope, as the lives of 1.3 billion people continue to be transformed.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Tocqueville's Lessons in Democracy</seg>
		<seg id="1">It seems appropriate that, due to the Iraq war, the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville's birth.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Tocqueville is justly famous for rejecting reactionary nostalgia and regarding democracy's triumph as our destiny, while warning against the dangers that democracy holds for liberty.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Should we still share his worries?</seg>
		<seg id="4">Tocqueville viewed democracy not only as a political regime, but, above all, as an intellectual regime that shapes a society's customs in general, thereby giving it a sociological and psychological dimension.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Democratic regimes, Tocqueville argued, determine our thoughts, desires, and passions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Just as there was Renaissance man and, in the twentieth century, homo sovieticus, &quot;democratic man&quot; is a form of human being.</seg>
		<seg id="7">For Tocqueville, democracy's systemic effects could lead citizens to deprive themselves of reasoned thought.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They could only pretend to judge events and values on their own; in reality, they would merely copy the rough and simplified opinions of the masses.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Indeed, what Tocqueville called the hold of &quot;social power&quot; on opinion is probably strongest in democratic regimes -- a view that foretells the growth of modern-day demagogy and media manipulation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Tocqueville believed that there are no effective long-term constraints on this tendency.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Neither local democracy nor small societies, neither governmental checks and balances nor civil rights, can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Schools have the power to be little more than enclaves from the corrosive strength of social influences on how the mind works.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Similarly, while Tocqueville thought that pursuing virtue as the ancients did, or having a religious faith, could sometimes elevate the soul, both conflict with the democratic ideal if they become officially prescribed in public life.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In this sense, Tocqueville's intellectual heirs include the neo-Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School, as well as Hannah Arendt, all of whom feared above all the disintegration of reason in modern societies.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Indeed, the French philosopher Marcel Gauchet entitled a recent book Democracy Against Itself.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The democratic way of life, these writers argue, tends to destroy original thought and to suppress &quot;high&quot; culture, yielding a mediocrity that leaves citizens vulnerable to democracy's enemies.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But, while history is replete with murderous regimes applauded by cowed and deceived masses, the greater risk for democratic nations is that their citizens withdraw into apathy and short-term thinking for immediate gratification.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The past -- despite rituals that seek to commemorate historic moments -- is obliterated by an addiction to the now and the new.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Even the supposedly well-educated ruling class is subject to this bewitchment.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The essential problem of the democratic mind is its lack of historical consciousness.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Do the defects of democracy really mean, as Tocqueville claimed, that resigned pessimism is the only -- realistic but unsustainable -- path open to us?</seg>
		<seg id="22">I don't think so.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There are means to fight against what might be called today's growing &quot;democratic stupidity.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">The first defense is to push for an educational system that really forms critical minds, namely through the (nowadays) largely neglected subjects of literature, history, and philosophy.</seg>
		<seg id="25">If the informed and critical citizenry that democracy requires is to be formed, our schools must stop pandering to the latest popular fads and begin to sharpen the analytical capacities of students.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The biggest impediment to such an education are the mass media, with its tendency to cultivate superficiality and amusement.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Many people nowadays spend more of their lives watching television than they do in classrooms.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The passivity that mass media encourages is the polar opposite of the active engagement that democratic citizens need.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But it is hard to imagine that the mass media (other than quality newspapers) would, of their own volition, become instruments of an education that enhances citizens' critical capacities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">This concern about mass media is no mere elitist scorn for popular culture.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The question is not one of popularity alone -- after all, Mozart was popular in his day, and Shakespeare's plays attracted the poor as well as the rich -- but of mass culture's refusal to challenge and provoke.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Indeed, for a long time a globalized media culture, one unable to inspire the capacity for critical thought or create elevated feelings, has been on the rise.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It is a culture that, through its carelessness, threatens democratic freedom because it fails to create any sense of obligation -- to society, to history, to community.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Is it too late to do anything about a culture that so deadens the spirit?</seg>
		<seg id="36">Tocqueville despised the elites of his time for their complacency in the face of the deracinating force of mass democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Will the myopia of our leaders also serve as an agent of his disquieting prophecy?</seg>

		<seg id="0">A Europe for All</seg>
		<seg id="1">Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union's future, but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To join in the EU's progress is the basic object of our foreign policy, for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end, but a beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, all are not free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net, tied in a single garment of destiny.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, of haves and have-nots, of insiders and outsiders.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot -- indeed, must not -- be considered a stranger to its Union.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Today's great Pax Europa and today's pan-European prosperity depend on this.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Of course, some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people, young and old, factory worker, farmer's wife, the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930's, who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970's?</seg>
		<seg id="14">Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland's Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague's Velvet Revolution in 1989?</seg>
		<seg id="15">That is the true European spirit, and no doubts can crush it.</seg>
		<seg id="16">To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: Let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Those who doubt Ukraine's European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom, prosperity, and solidarity.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I believe that our future is as promising as Europe's past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe's peace and Europe's unity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status.</seg>
		<seg id="21">New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany -- a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests.</seg>
		<seg id="22">That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia, and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe's peace.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Of course, it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="24">We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.</seg>
		<seg id="25">We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations, but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or fast.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done.</seg>
		<seg id="28">We know the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the struggle, and Europe should know that this is our goal.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism -- ideologies born in the heart of Europe -- battled for mastery.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Only a few months ago, in cities throughout Ukraine, our children and our parents confronted armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about our old regime's corruption, was brutalized and beheaded by that regime's thugs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine's people prevailed.</seg>
		<seg id="33">So, despite today's doubts and difficulties, I retain an abiding faith in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="34">I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine's history.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism's legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity.</seg>
		<seg id="36">When the EU's citizens ponder Ukraine's place in Europe, they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted, beyond the poverty, and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Instead, they should look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison during last year's election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom &quot;the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Muslim Civil War</seg>
		<seg id="1">Is the Sunni-Shia divide in the Middle East now deeper than the antagonism between Israel and the Arabs?</seg>
		<seg id="2">You might think so given the response of some Arab governments to Hezbollah's decision to attack Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Even as Israeli bombs fell on Beirut and Tyre, Saudi Arabia, perhaps the most conservative Arab Muslim state of all, openly condemned the actions of the Shia Hezbollah in instigating conflict with Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a state that considers itself a leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Moreover, Saudi Arabia's breach with Hezbollah is not a one-time occurrence.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Egypt and Jordan have also roundly condemned Hezbollah and its leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for their adventurism.</seg>
		<seg id="7">What is behind this stunning development?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Are we seeing a fundamental shift in relations between Arab nationalism and Islamic sectarianism?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Is Saudi Arabia's Sunni government more concerned and frightened by Shia Islam than it is committed to Arab unity and the Palestinian cause?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Arab denunciations of Hezbollah suggest that the Muslim sectarian divide, already evident in the daily violence in Iraq, is deepening and intensifying across the Middle East.</seg>
		<seg id="11">President George W. Bush's desire to shatter the Arab world's frozen societies was meant to pit the forces of modernization against the traditional elements in Arab and Islamic societies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Instead, he appears to have unleashed the region's most atavistic forces.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Opening this Pandora's Box may have ushered in a new and even uglier era of generalized violence, perhaps what can only be called a &quot;Muslim Civil War.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">The Shia-Sunni divide has existed from the dawn of Islam, but the geographical and ethnic isolation of non-Arab Shiite Iran, together with Sunni Arab countries' dominance of their Shia minorities, mostly kept this rivalry in the background.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These tensions further receded in the tide of the &quot;Islamization&quot; created by the Iranian revolution, for in its wake Arabs' sectarian identity as Sunni was pushed further into the background as a generalized &quot;Islamic&quot; assertiveness appeared.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That all changed when Al Qaeda, a Sunni terrorist force that draws heavily on Saudi Wahabbi ideology and personnel, launched its attacks on America in September 2001.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A specifically Sunni brand of militant Islam was now on the march.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When the United States initiated wars on both the Sunni Taliban in Afghanistan and the Sunni Iraqi regime, this new radical Sunni strain became even more emboldened.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The region's newly assertive Sunni Arabs perceive Israel and the West as being only one threat, the other comprising the so-called &quot;Shia crescent&quot; -- the arc of land extending from Lebanon to Iran through Syria and Iraq that is inhabited by the allegedly heretical Shia.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Saudi Arabia's rulers, as custodians of the Muslim faith's holiest places in Mecca and Medina, perhaps feel this threat most keenly.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In Sunni eyes, the Shia not only dominate the oil-rich areas of Iran, Iraq, and the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, but are -- through the actions of Hezbollah -- attempting to usurp the role of &quot;protector&quot; of the central dream of all Arabs, the Palestinian cause.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is because the Saudi royal family derives its legitimacy from a strict form of Sunni Islam and doubts the loyalty of its Shia population that the Kingdom has turned on Hezbollah.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Ironically, it is America, Saudi Arabia's longtime protector, which made Shia empowerment possible by overthrowing Saddam Hussein and bringing Shiite parties to power in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Bush administration seems to recognize what it has done; as the Shia arc rises in the east of the Arab Muslim world, the US is attempting to strengthen its protection of the Sunni arc -- Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia -- in the region's west.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Israel, the once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure.</seg>
		<seg id="26">But such a defensive posture is bound to be unstable, due to pan-Arab feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Today, ordinary Saudi citizens are glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite TV networks to follow events in Gaza and south Lebanon.</seg>
		<seg id="28">They see Arab (not Shiite) blood being shed, with only Hezbollah fighting back.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In their eyes, Hezbollah has become a heroic model of resistance.</seg>
		<seg id="30">This is causing the Saudi state to deepen the Sunni-Shia schism.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Following the Kingdom's official denunciation of Hezbollah, the Saudi state called on its official Wahhabi clerics to issue fatwas condemning Hezbollah as Shiite deviants and heretics.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Such condemnations can only sharpen sectarian divisions within Saudi Arabia and the region.</seg>
		<seg id="33">As these antagonisms deepen, will the Sunni regimes come to believe that they need their own Hezbollah to fight in their corner?</seg>
		<seg id="34">If that is what they conclude, they need not look far, for many such fighters have already have been trained -- by Al Qaeda.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Georgia on Europe's Mind</seg>
		<seg id="1">The era in which Europe could rely on America to wage war, make peace, and establish democracy in its own backyard is over.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With European Union enlargement, and as the recent Russian gas crisis demonstrated, that backyard now includes not just Ukraine, but Georgia as well.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, as in Ukraine, Georgia is undergoing a test of democracy that Europe cannot afford to ignore.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Georgia was the first post-Soviet country to stage a &quot;color revolution,&quot; and thus to demonstrate, with dignity and maturity, its people's choice for democracy and European values.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The European Union flags that have flown on all Georgian public buildings since then signal a natural attachment, as old as the history of a country that, for the ancient Greeks, was an integral part of the world as it was then known.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prometheus, Medea, the Amazons and, in neighboring Armenia, Noah's Ark -- the Europe of our myths starts here.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With its history, culture, and traditions -- including its critical, independent, and even rebellious spirit within the former Soviet Union -- Georgia would seem to be an ideal candidate for successful democratization.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So it is all the more worrisome that democratization there is foundering.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Everything seemed to have started well enough.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption measures, a search for new leaders untainted by compromise with the former regime, and implementation of a pro-European foreign policy met no resistance.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the totalitarian mindset has since resurfaced in leaders who, with their claim to represent the will of the majority, appropriate more and more power.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Like the ancient Greeks' Hydra, Georgia's political elite never ceases to die and be reborn.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The same people and governing methods that the &quot;Rose Revolution&quot; of November 2003 sought to defeat have reemerged at the center of power by using their personal networks, which extend outside Georgia's borders, as well as their tremendous wealth and finely honed skills at political scheming and manipulation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This bears little in common with the essence of democracy, which consists not merely in ballot boxes, but in the separation of powers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The government meddles in the affairs of the parliament, which in turn seeks to micro-manage the government -- including, in my case, the nomination of ambassadors and their daily routines!</seg>
		<seg id="16">Finally, and more seriously, the judiciary is not yet independent, undermining the rule of law and thus deterring badly needed private investment.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Georgia's democracy exists in its head, but not yet in its body: citizens still spurn politics as a dirty pursuit, abandoning the ground to those who should have been retired long ago.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But the hope of democracy remains strongly rooted in Georgia's people, civic organizations, and media.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Now is the time for Europe to ensure that this hope is not extinguished.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The US has already done as much as it can to support political stability in Georgia since independence.</seg>
		<seg id="21">To be sure, stability was not always identified with democracy during the rule of Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Union foreign minister who was ousted as our president by the Rose Revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But Americans invested generously in the survival of democratic ideas and leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although the foundation backed by the financier George Soros did not fabricate the Rose Revolution, as Russian nationalists claim, it certainly nurtured, encouraged, and supported democracy's preconditions.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But, to help consolidate its democracy, Georgia now requires support of a different nature, which Europe is better equipped to offer.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The models for the balance of powers, the functioning of the judiciary, and local democracy must be inspired by European forms, which are closer to Georgian reality than Anglo-Saxon models of the American type.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Europe's rejection of this challenge would betray its fundamental duties in a place -- small, Mediterranean, flexible, with old historical traditions -- where democracy stands a much greater chance of success than in Ukraine, which is both huge and still very Soviet-minded, not to mention Central Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Indeed, refusal to support Georgia's struggling democracy would most likely postpone democratic progress in Ukraine, Belarus, even in Russia itself.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This clearly raises the stakes.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Russia, while never renouncing its imperial dreams and instruments of domination, was nonetheless coming to terms with the inevitability of democracy, at least on its margins.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia's famously irrational &quot;derzhava&quot; -- an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This is the key to understanding the recent Russian gas crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Just as surely, any sign of a retreat from democracy in Georgia and other post-Soviet states will merely fuel Russia's neo-imperial ambitions.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It is Europe's responsibility to convince Russia that there is no hope of a return to the past.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Europe must assume this role not only to ensure the future independence of its energy supply, but also to demonstrate that European values of freedom, democracy, and justice between peoples have real force.</seg>
		<seg id="35">To succeed, Europe must equip itself with the necessary instruments: a large semi-public foundation to promote Europe and support political reform, a university to train future executives of nascent democracies, a police force, and an army of judges and magistrates to breathe life into the models that we want to emulate.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Above all, Europe needs conviction.</seg>
		<seg id="37">If Europe today cannot convince itself that it has a vital interest in its neighbors' future, who will believe in Europe tomorrow?</seg>

		<seg id="0">Berlusconi at Bay</seg>
		<seg id="1">Silvio Berlusconi, who becomes President of the European Union on July 1, is a perceptive man who once loved taking risks and his business bets proved to be profitable. In the 1960s, he was the first to see that Milan, a traditional Italian city where people walked to go to work, will become a modern metropolis with American style suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">So, he built his fortune on real estate expansion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fifteen years later, Signor Berlusoni understood that the Italian state's monopoly of television would not survive and jump-started what became Italy's main privately owned media group.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But you don't win in TV and the real estate business without the right political connections.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On both occasions, Berlusconi outwitted his competitors by siding with the Socialists, at the time the rising stars of Italian political life.</seg>
		<seg id="6">His long association with Bettino Craxi, Milan's most influential politician in the 1970's and Italy's prime minister through much of the 1980's, started early.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On the other hand, political connections do not make a politician.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Indeed, the jump from business into politics was probably not Berlusconi's own preference.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By the 1990's, his media group was in trouble, weakened by excessive diversification (the decision to enter the retail-distribution business almost destroyed the group).</seg>
		<seg id="10">Almost at the same time, ex-premier Craxi fled to Tunisia, chased there by the Italian courts at the height of the mani pulite (clean hands) investigation into the vast network of corruption known as Tangentopoli (Bribesville).</seg>
		<seg id="11">Craxi's flight and exile left Berlusconi feeling lost--and without the reliable political backing that he needed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So he decided that he needed to become his own political sponsor.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As has happened frequently in Italian history, Berlusconi's decision to form a new political party, Forza Italia , just a few months before the 1994 general election paid off handsomely.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Berlusconi's lack of experience in politics doomed his first government to collapse after only six months.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Any other man as rich as Berlusconi would probably have given up.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But Berlusconi remained and led the opposition for six years.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In 2001 his determination was rewarded with a clear victory and, more importantly, a seemingly clear mandate for change.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Once again Berlusconi probably had no choice: by the late 1990's, his association with the disgraced Socialists was haunting him politically and legally.</seg>
		<seg id="19">His only hope of fending off the magistrates was to control parliament and introduce new laws that would stop the series of corruption trials he faces--a strategy that has now given him immunity from prosecution until he leaves office.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Unfortunately, while Berlusconi's government is invariably long on speeches, legal provisions designed to stop the clock on his court cases are among the few laws that have passed in his two years of government.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Berlusconi's performance in government is a combination of good intuition--for instance the early attempt to reform Italian pensions in 1994--and poor implementation, most likely because of a lack of courage, as surprising as that seems.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In 1994, during his first government, he understood early on that Italy needed to overhaul its pension system, and introduced bold legislation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But one general strike was enough to kill his reformist zeal.</seg>
		<seg id="24">More recently, he courageously sided with the US on the war in Iraq, against the majority of the country and most of his own political coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But soon he seemed scared of his own boldness and faded into an almost invisible ally.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Despite Berlusconi's rhetoric, he did not go (or was not invited) to the summit meeting with President Bush in the Azores, where the final decision to go to war was taken.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On labor reforms, he fought the unions head on, but he chose the wrong fight: Italy's infamous &quot;Article 18,&quot; which allows labor courts to return a worker to his job if a judge believes that the worker was unjustly fired.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But while Article 18 is important in principle, it is almost irrelevant in practice.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The outcome was a confrontation with the unions that distracted from more important labor reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Contrary to what happened in 1994, Berlusconi's current government survives, but whoever hoped for a free-market revolution will be disappointed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">There has been no tax cut of any significance, and pension reform is still waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Berlusconi's powerful finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, speaks often and fondly of the necessity of renewed government intervention in the economy; nothing is done to prevent strikes in the public transportation sector.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Moderate right-wing voters, who wanted an Italian (i.e., somewhat watered-down) version of the Reagan/Thatcher era are disillusioned.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Berlusconi tries to mask his inactivity by scaring his voters, repeating again and again that electing the moderate left would mean signing a pact with the devil, i.e., the &quot;communists.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="35">Italians seem smarter, as the result of the June administrative elections clearly have shown.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Why has the courageous visionary of the 1960's and 1970's lost his shine?</seg>
		<seg id="37">Part of it is precisely that it is no longer the 1960's and 1970's: Berlusconi is 40 years older and for the past ten years has lived in the world of Roman politics.</seg>
		<seg id="38">There he learned the art of political (and personal) survival, but lost his vision and his love for risk taking.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Closing the US-Europe Technology Gap</seg>
		<seg id="1">In the second half of the 1990's, Europe's average annual growth rate of productivity amounted to 0.7%, while the US hummed along at 1.4%.</seg>
		<seg id="2">However, if we distinguish between the industries that produce information and communications technologies (ICT) and those that are simply users of such technologies, we can see that the productivity growth gap stems almost entirely from the weakness of Europe's ICT producing sector.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Annual productivity growth in sectors that are users of ICT technologies averaged 0.63% in the US between 1995 and 2000, and a very similar 0.41% in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This confirms a well known fact: Europe is less efficient than the US at producing research that is conducive to innovation--either because Europe allocates fewer resources to research, or because the available resources are used less efficiently, or both.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To be sure, total spending on research and development is lower in Europe than in the US, but not by much.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the 1990's, the US devoted 2.8% of GDP annually on R&amp;amp;D, compared with 2.3% in Germany, 2% in the UK, and 1.9% in France.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Still, European governments typically complain about the lack of fiscal resources to support R&amp;amp;D (a far fetched argument given the miniscule share of research spending in the oversized European budgets) and, whenever the European Commission allows them, they subsidize innovative firms, or those that they think are more likely to invest in R&amp;amp;D.</seg>
		<seg id="8">France and Italy, for example, demanded that the limits imposed the budget deficits of euro zone members by the Stability and Growth Pact exclude public spending for research.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Similarly, the French government decided to bail out Alstom--a company that developed a number of high-tech products, including the TGV, the French fast train--before ending up bankrupt.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But both tactics are unlikely to boost the European high-tech sector.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Because weakness in research is not--at least not primarily--a funding issue.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Subsidies will not produce efficient high-tech firms.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Let us consider research first.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Europe trails the US in every dimension: the number of patents, the number of Nobel laureates, the number of researchers it is able to attract from the rest of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But funding is only part of the problem.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A euro spent on research in Europe is less productive than a dollar spent in the US for two reasons: incentives and the demand for technology.</seg>
		<seg id="18">We fear that spending more money without changing archaic university rules would produce more waste, not more research output.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It would only increase the power, prestige, and resources of entrenched lobbies of established university professors who often prevent entry and competition.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Demand for technology is also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It helps focusing research, it provides deadlines, screens the output, and allows patents to be valued at market prices.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Without the incentives provided by those on the receiving end of its output, research risks drifting along, often without clear direction.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Admittedly this is not true in all fields: the study of Ancient Greek fragments is valuable even it meets hardly any demand.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But it is important in those fields, both theoretical and applied, that might be used as an input in the production of new technologies: physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But it is defense spending that is the major factor in the demand for research.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Most technological breakthroughs in the postwar period--from microchips to the Internet to the new batteries for cellular phones developed for the US Army in Iraq--had, at least initially, a military application.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Cell phones, satellite tracking, and high-resolution cameras are not cheap to come by, but happily for the industries that use them, costs for their development have been partly picked up by the government.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One key reason for the superiority of the US in research is the size and the composition of defense expenditure.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The Pentagon's budget is not simply big: it accounts for more than one half of all US government spending on research and development: in France, defense spending is only around a quarter of the total.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In 1999, US spending on defense-related R&amp;amp;D was 0.45% of GDP; the UK and France were next, but with just half as much, 0.26% and 0.22%, respectively.</seg>
		<seg id="31">As the Alstom case suggests, the French have a different model in mind.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Rather than supporting R&amp;amp;D with large defense budgets, they prefer to do it directly, subsidizing French high-tech firms.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The official justification is that national defense budgets are too small to create the demand that would be needed to support R&amp;amp;D in high-tech sectors, while there is still no European defense budget.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This is no coincidence: if allocated competitively, such a supra-national budget would identify winners and losers.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But many European countries still refuse to accept that some of their high-tech firms might not make it: better, they think, to keep them alive with generous subsidies, and in the meantime avoid the consolidation of EU defense budgets.</seg>
		<seg id="36">By integrating its defense expenditures and increasing their size, Europe would hit two birds with one stone.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It would be more credible when it demands to be heard at international bargaining tables, particularly vis-à-vis the US, and it would stimulate scientific research.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The way to achieve these goals is not to run larger deficits, which merely imply higher taxes tomorrow, but to cut spending in other parts of the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In short: short-run pain for long-run gain.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The American Way of Debt</seg>
		<seg id="1">After almost 15 years of unprecedented growth - interrupted only by a brief slowdown in 2000-2001 - the United States has accumulated a huge stock of foreign liabilities, equivalent to 25% of its GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With the current account deficit now exceeding 5% of GDP, US foreign debt is rising fast.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But no country can accumulate debt forever - and what cannot last sooner or later must end.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In early 1985, when the US current account deficit reached $120 billion, about a third of today's level at current prices, the rest of the world stopped financing it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The outcome was a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, which depreciated by 50% against the Deutschemark.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Europe should not welcome a sequel.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indeed, the world itself cannot afford the disappearance of the US current account deficit - at least not quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Take away US imports and the timid growth Europe has seen in the past year would immediately disappear.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This may already be happening: the appreciation of the euro, from $1.20 to $1.30 in the past few months, was enough to bring European growth to a standstill during the third quarter of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Before the dollar started to weaken, exports from the 25 EU member states were growing at 6.5% per year, compared with 2% for consumption and 3% for investment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Even in Japan, the recent recovery was almost entirely led by exports.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But as the yen strengthens, Japan, too, seems to stop growing.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With central banks around the world full of dollars and trade imbalances becoming worrisome, there are three possible solutions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">One is that domestic saving in the US increases.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But this is unlikely, at least in the near future, given President Bush's ambitious fiscal plans and the continuing war in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="16">US private savings are also slightly negative, and an increase might lead to a slowdown in the short run.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The second possibility is a more pronounced devaluation of the dollar, bringing it well beyond the current levels relative to both the euro and the yen.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Revaluation of the Chinese yuan would also help.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The third option is a pick up of growth in Europe, which would increase US exports.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This could happen only if European companies cut costs and increase productivity.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As always, a litany of plans and promises for &quot;structural reforms&quot; can be heard, but none of them is likely to be implemented anytime soon.</seg>
		<seg id="22">So what can be done?</seg>
		<seg id="23">One alternative is to increase working hours without increasing salary per hours proportionally.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Americans and Europeans worked the same number of hours in the early 1970's.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Today, Europeans work 50% less on average in France and Germany than in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="26">This is partly due to higher taxes in Europe, and this cannot be undone: nobody can force someone to work if they consider their take-home pay too low because of a high marginal tax rate.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But the relative decline in work hours is also due to trade unions' success in winning compulsory vacation time.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Labor reform leading to longer hours would not reduce the total income of the employed, but it would reduce production costs.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some discussion of this idea is beginning to appear in the press and, it is to be hoped, behind close doors among policymakers and union leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Until this happens, it is in the rest of the world's interest to let the US continue to run an unprecedented current account deficit by financing it at the rate of $500 billion per year.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This allows the Chinese to keep their currency stable vis-à-vis the dollar, remain super-competitive, and thus enable a gradual shift of 200 million workers from agriculture into manufacturing, the authorities' aim over the next 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In Europe, America's external deficit keeps the sole source of growth alive.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But, again, this will not last forever.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Eventually, Europe will have to stop thinking that the US can save its economy and will have to start relying on its own resources.</seg>
		<seg id="35">But don't be surprised if the next European downturn will be blamed on the US and the depreciation of the dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="36">It is always useful to have a scapegoat.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel</seg>
		<seg id="1">For almost two generations, Abba Eban was Israel's voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940's during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty, few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II.</seg>
		<seg id="4">As Ambassador to the United States and the UN, and later as Foreign Minister, he represented an Israel with which the world's liberal imagination could identify.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman, and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands.</seg>
		<seg id="6">His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity.</seg>
		<seg id="7">His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was a true patriot, in the old-fashioned sense of the word: proud of his people, but never ethno-centric; a man of the world, but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people, but never losing the universal horizon of mankind.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In short, he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages, all of them in Yiddish.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages, and all of them with an Oxford/Cambridge accent.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Perhaps Eban was too urbane, too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli's phrase - to the top of the greasy pole.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973, yet it nonetheless brought him down as well.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He never found his way back, and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism, he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the international arena, Eban's pen was his sword, and the spoken word his lance.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He was less adept in political infighting in Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He could be a fierce turf fighter, yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is far from clear if he would have prevailed, given his lack of an independent political base, but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He never did.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Eban's silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health.</seg>
		<seg id="24">At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists, the moral certitudes of Eban, for all their urbanity, may sound shallow.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But nation-building requires moral stamina, and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years, I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01, and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state.</seg>
		<seg id="28">As an Arabist by training, immersed in Arab and Muslim culture, he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab.</seg>
		<seg id="30">That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban's greatest disappointment.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Despite the high-born image Eban projected, he was an extremely vulnerable person: what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins.</seg>
		<seg id="32">While appearing to own the Queen's English, Eban was not to the manor born: he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry.</seg>
		<seg id="33">He was, in the true sense of the word, a self-made man, whose pluck, ambition, drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements.</seg>
		<seg id="34">His was the aristocracy of the spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks</seg>
		<seg id="1">Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.</seg>
		<seg id="13">They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded &quot;Revisionist&quot; Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then there are the strategic hawks.</seg>
		<seg id="15">For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?</seg>
		<seg id="20">Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He has brought neither.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an &quot;Eastern front&quot; against Israel has diminished.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges.</seg>
		<seg id="27">First, he admitted that &quot;eventually&quot; a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of &quot;liberated&quot; rather than &quot;occupied&quot; territories.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the &quot;relocation&quot; of some settlements.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers.</seg>
		<seg id="32">All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Victors' Justice, Iraqi-Style</seg>
		<seg id="1">Saddam Hussein is dead, but not all Iraqis are celebrating.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On the contrary, the way in which the various religious and ethnic groups in Iraq responded to his execution is emblematic of the difficulty of holding Iraq together as a coherent entity.</seg>
		<seg id="3">To the Shiite majority, long brutally oppressed by Saddam and all previous Sunni-dominated Iraqi regimes, Saddam's death symbolizes their attainment of political hegemony.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To the Sunni minority, pushed from power by the American invasion and giving vent to their frustration with daily attacks on the Shi'a population and their holy sites, Saddam will remain a hero for a long time to come.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Kurds -- who, like the Shi'a, were victimized by Saddam for decades -- quietly cling to their de facto independence in the north, making sure that they will never again come under Arab rule.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Iraq's prime minister, Nuri el-Maliki, representing the ruling Shi'a-Kurdish coalition, expressed the hope that the dictator's end would help to heal the sectarian divides.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But, however sincere his words may sound, reality is moving in the opposite direction, and the ugly verbal exchanges surrounding the act of execution itself will certainly do little to dispel the notion that this was &quot;victors' justice&quot; -- the victors being not the United States, but the Shi'a.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of this augurs well for the future of what we should get used to calling &quot;the former Iraq.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Indeed, the Washington debate surrounding how to &quot;fix Iraq&quot; is irrelevant, because something that does not exist any longer -- namely, Iraq as a functioning state -- cannot be fixed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the guise of US-inspired constitutional arrangements, the Shia majority has succeeded in arrogating near-absolute power to itself.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Thus, what only a few months ago had looked from Washington like a successful transition to some sort of representative government is obviously a travesty: just as under Saddam, power today grows out of the barrel of the gun -- only now the state does not hold a monopoly on the means of violence.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Every militia, every ministry, every Shia political faction, has its own guns, goons, and death squads -- while the Sunnis continue to use the stockpiles of weapons they accumulated under Saddam to fight a rear-guard action against the new order, apparently legitimized by elections.</seg>
		<seg id="14">There is no power -- save a new violent dictatorship -- that can bring Shi'a, Sunnis, and Kurds to live once again in one body politic.</seg>
		<seg id="15">America's chimerical dream of democratizing overnight a deeply divided society accustomed only to violence and coercion has unleashed a terrifying array of political demons.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In these circumstances, the post-Baker-Hamilton debate in Washington is largely irrelevant to the future of Iraq -- though it continues to be crucial to the future of US power, prestige, and standing in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The future of Iraq will be decided by the people of Iraq, but with bullets, not ballots.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The US and the entire international community are utterly unequipped to deal with this Middle Eastern version of Yugoslavia and its regional consequences.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And, unlike Yugoslavia's successor states, which could look to Europe, the lack of a legitimate Arab democratic role model makes crafting a democratic order even more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Some Europeans and others may gloat over America's failure in Iraq, and the ineptness -- or worse -- of US post-occupation policy cries to heaven.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Yet the root causes of that failure go deeper, to Iraq's creation as an artificial entity in the 1920's by British imperialist planners, who stitched together three disparate provinces of the defeated Ottoman Empire into a state that never had a coherent identity.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Indeed, the very foundation of Iraq was based on victors' justice: the British Empire, having vanquished the Ottomans, made the Sunni Arabs overlords in a country in which they were a minority.</seg>
		<seg id="23">That arrangement has now come unglued following another cycle of victors' justice.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But a coherent Iraqi state -- whether unitary, federal, or confederal -- will not grow out of a society in which one part of the population views Saddam, rightly, as a gruesome oppressor, while another part reveres him as a hero and martyr.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Wars always have unintended consequences and cruel ironies.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Iraq, only now is it becoming evident that some states cannot be saved without being destroyed.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The European Union's Battle for Turkey</seg>
		<seg id="1">When the plotters behind the recent suicide attacks in Istanbul launched their human bombs against Jewish synagogues and British office buildings, they had several audiences in mind.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One audience--and potentially the most important--are the citizens of the European Union, which Turkey's political class is eager to join as soon as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The battle over Turkish membership in the EU will be fought on many fronts: in the country itself, where the government is currently undertaking major reforms in order to qualify for candidate status; at the negotiating table once the European Council in December 2004 authorizes the Commission to enter into formal accession talks; and among the public within the existing member countries.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Of the three fronts, the latter will be the most demanding.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Most EU citizens are uneasy today over the prospect of Turkish membership.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Those responsible for the atrocities in Istanbul may have calculated that Islamic terrorism will increase that uneasiness further.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Traditionally, Europe's citizens have always accepted the new members that queued up to join the club as it went from the original group of six countries to the 25 that will form the EU in 2004.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Once a purely West European community, the Union has pushed out its frontiers in all directions.</seg>
		<seg id="9">From next year, it will stretch from the north of Finland to Cyprus and Malta in the south, from Ireland in the west to the Baltic states in the east.</seg>
		<seg id="10">While the people inside have often worried that newcomers would take away their jobs and subsidies, they usually acquiesced in the end.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But Turkey is different.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The 10 new countries that will join next year--and even the Balkan countries that are now being offered the prospect of future membership--are all embraced by a traditional definition of Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="13">None of them is of a size that could upset the EU's current balance.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Neither applies to Turkey.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Except for a small stretch of land, its territory lies in Asia, not Europe; its culture is Islamic, not Christian, and if it should join in, say, 2013, its population will be by far the largest--and youngest--of any EU member.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Moreover, because Turkey borders on such countries as Iran, Iraq and Syria, it will bring to the EU a disturbing neighborhood: a part of the world incapable of developing a regional order on its own, a cockpit of Islamic radicalism and terrorism, a collection of fragile states imbued with nationalism, a field of competition for arms, even nuclear arms, a region where the US will remain strategically involved and where Israel will continue to provide a rallying point for anti-Western sentiments.</seg>
		<seg id="17">With Turkey as a member, the EU will be part of the troubled and troubling wider Middle East, the most challenging region in today's world.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Yet it is precisely because of these implications that the advantages of having Turkey inside the EU far outweigh the risks.</seg>
		<seg id="19">First and foremost, the prospect of membership is the most powerful force for modernization in Turkey, and a modern, democratic, and prosperous Turkey is of central interest to Europe, whether inside or outside.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, including within the EU the moderate type of Islam for which Turkey stands will be a major help in integrating Muslim minorities within European countries--already large and growing even without the addition of Turkey's population.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Finally, with the opportunities that Turkey's Islamic traditions, regional contacts, resources, and geography provide, the EU will be much better placed to exert a stabilizing influence on a region that will affect Europe's security in any case.</seg>
		<seg id="22">These are powerful arguments.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The big question is whether they are powerful enough to sway a skeptical European public.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It would take only one country out of perhaps 30 EU members in 2013 to bloc Turkey's accession.</seg>
		<seg id="25">No doubt some of them will put the matter to a referendum that will leave the decision to the people, not just their parliaments.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Even in Germany, where referenda are not envisaged by the constitution, there are calls to hold one over Turkey's entry; one opposition party has already announced that it will make this a central issue in next year's election campaign for the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Once public unease towards Turkey can find focus in a referendum on the country's potential EU membership, the chances for it joining look fairly slim.</seg>
		<seg id="28">At the end of the negotiations it may thus come to pass that Turkey is ready for Europe, but Europe is not yet ready for Turkey.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This is why the battle over Turkish membership has already begun, and the bombers of Istanbul seem to have understood this.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Those who believe that the EU is right for both Turkey and Europe must also start to fight for what they profess.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Nothing would be worse--for both Turkey and Europe--than European governments wanting Turkey in but then failing to take their people along.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Terrorists will no doubt continue to instill fear of an Islamic Turkey among Europe's fainthearted.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Let us hope that in the end, the attacks on innocent people in the crowded streets of Istanbul do not foster European fears, but rather a sense of solidarity with that moderate and dynamic country in the face of a common enemy.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Sadly, the European Union seems to be taking Frost's poetic whimsy as a serious policy prescription.</seg>
		<seg id="3">For how is the EU preparing to welcome the citizens of the ten countries that will become members in May?</seg>
		<seg id="4">Simple: by shutting the door in their faces, and then building regulatory walls to keep them away from the door in the first place.</seg>

		<seg id="9">France and Belgium will restrict immigration by new EU citizens for at least the first two-years of the transition period.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Sweden initially appeared to take a liberal stance, but is now postponing opening its borders and may tighten migrants' access to welfare benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Danish government almost collapsed in January when the Ministry of Labor proposed to open the job market to all new EU citizens who can prove that they have found employment.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Greece and Italy have been silent so far, which means that they are likely to keep current restrictions vis-à-vis the new members: they will de facto be treated the same as migrants from outside the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Thus, all the countries bordering the new member states will be closed to migration from the &quot;New Europe.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">All this barrier-building reflects mounting public concern about citizens from the new member states emigrating to take advantage of generous welfare systems in the Union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Little wonder, then, that the largest drops in popular support for enlargement registered by the Eurobarometer Survey occurred in EU countries with the most generous welfare states.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But support for enlargement is fading everywhere, right on the brink of accession.</seg>
		<seg id="17">At the same time, closing the doors to the Union's newest citizens will not solve the problem of welfare access and will certainly hurt economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In EU labor markets characterized by low mobility, such as those that exist across Western and Southern Europe, migrants can play a very important role.</seg>
		<seg id="19">By increasing average productivity, they contribute not only to stronger growth, but also to achieving higher incomes per capita.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact, due to distortions in how wages are set-often set irrespective of local labor productivity rates-migrants can even contribute to reducing unemployment in Western and Southern Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, shutting the door will not solve the problem of welfare access, because illegal migration is worse than legal migration: it draws resources without contributing anything to finance the welfare state even though most migrants are young and do work.</seg>
		<seg id="22">A better way to deal with the fear of migrants abusing social welfare systems would be to adopt a common and rather generous transitional quota at the level of the EU as a whole, to be lifted early if it is not filled.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Migration quotas should be preferred to other types of restrictions on the ground that they allow at least a part of the potential welfare gains from migration to be realized.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Quotas could be established at levels set on the basis of past periods of high migration - say, an annual flow of 400,000 people to the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="25">While these transitional restrictions are put in place, reforms should be undertaken that address the underlying basis for the public's fear of migration.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The root of this fear, of course, is the vast differences in income between citizens of, say, Lithuania, and those of most of the Union.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Of course, economic convergence is a long-term business.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Thus, redistributive policies in the EU should be reformed in ways that discourage &quot;welfare shopping&quot; by citizens of its poorest member states.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Here the problem is the incompatibility of insurance schemes, on the one hand, in which the benefits that people receive are based on what they have contributed, and, on the other hand, social assistance programs that entail cash transfers.</seg>
		<seg id="30">All EU countries, including the new members, should be encouraged to adapt social assistance schemes (which also exist in the new member states) so as to meet some basic income requirements.</seg>
		<seg id="31">EU-wide coordination of these minimum guaranteed income schemes should be gradually pursued, with the long-term intention of building up a pan-European safety net as one of the institutional pillars of the EU.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Calderon's Cauldron</seg>
		<seg id="1">Under dramatically inauspicious circumstances, Mexico has finally got itself a new president last Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Felipe Calderón has taken the oath of office, braving the wrath of his left-wing opposition, out-smarting the Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD) and its leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, but nonetheless paying a high price.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Every TV news show and front-page headline in the world ran the same headline: &quot;New Mexican President inaugurated in chaos and fisticuffs.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mexico's institutions withstood -- just barely -- the onslaught of a virtually insurrectional left-wing opposition, bent in vain on stopping Calderón's inauguration, and of a resentful Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), increasingly dedicated to allowing Calderón to take office, and then fail miserably.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Calderón impressively overcame apparently insurmountable obstacles on the way to the presidency, yet the struggle to govern and transform Mexico has just begun.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most Mexican commentators believe that it should be relatively easy for Calderón to improve on the largely self-inflicted failure of outgoing President Vicente Fox's term.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mexico needs to grow at roughly twice the rate that it did under Fox (a meager 2% per year).</seg>
		<seg id="8">If Calderón can strengthen law and order, and use his considerable political skills to reach agreement with the PRI on structural economic reforms, he will succeed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But this view is simplistic.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Fox's term, along with the four last years of former President Ernesto Zedillo's mandate, were hardly a failure.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Not since the 1960's had Mexico undergone ten consecutive years of economic stability, low inflation, low interest rates, a stable currency, and constant, though mediocre growth.</seg>
		<seg id="12">For the first time ever, mortgages, automobile loans, and consumer credit became available to the lower middle class: this year more homes were built and sold, and more cars were bought, than ever before.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Likewise, while Fox can be criticized for not clamping down on protesters and a disruptive, extremist opposition, he never resorted to the bloody repression for which most of his predecessors came to be known.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Moreover, he dragged Mexico out of its archaic foreign policy cocoon, and placed immigration and human rights at the heart of Mexico's new international agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Nor is Calderón finding it easy to negotiate with the PRI, failing to build a coalition government, which he has repeatedly proclaimed as the solution to the gridlock that has cursed Mexico since 1997.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Whatever the advantages of a cabinet comprising solely members of his Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), this is not what Calderón sought.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Similarly, no deal with the opposition was possible regarding the inauguration ceremony -- thus the chaotic, depressing scenes of congressmen fighting it out in their chamber, while Calderón was ushered in through the back door for a rushed ceremony.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Mexico's economic problems might be similarly more intractable than many commentators seem to believe.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mexico experienced a &quot;cold-turkey&quot; economic opening under former President Carlos Salinas in 1988-1994; a belated but successful political opening under former President Zedillo in 1994-2000; and, at long last, a true rotation in power thanks to Fox.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But the foundations of the old PRI-corporativist system created in the 1930's remain untouched, and represent the main and most formidable obstacles to Mexico's growth and success.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The first pillar of this system is the public and private economic monopolies that dominate the country.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The state-owned oil (Pemex) and electric power (Federal Electricity Commission) companies face no competition.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The private virtual monopolies in telecommunications (Telmex), television (Televisa), cement (Cemex), bread and tortilla manufacturing (Bimbo and Maseca, respectively), banking (Banamex/Citigroup and Bancomer/Banco de Bilbao) may face competition abroad, but not at home.</seg>
		<seg id="24">These monopolies are stronger than ever, and prices, supply, service, and quality all suffer.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The second pillar is formed by the unions that have controlled the Mexican labor movement since the 1930's.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They enjoy &quot;closed shop&quot; hiring and firing prerogatives, leadership elections by acclamation, mandatory dues without transparency, and immense political power.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The teachers' union is the largest in Latin America, the oil workers' union is the richest in Latin America, and the social security employees union has thwarted any attempt at pension or health reform for years.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The third pillar of the system is political monopoly.</seg>
		<seg id="29">For 70 years, the PRI had a complete lock on Mexican politics; now three parties do, and no one else can enter the political arena or gain access to the enormous public subsidies -- more than $500 million last year -- handed out to these parties without their consent.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The main parties write their own anti-trust legislation, vote their own subsidies, and choose their own elected officials.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The absence of consecutive re-election at any level reinforces the party machines' power: they pick candidates, whom voters merely ratify at the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="32">So Mexico's challenges boil down to liberating the labor movement, breaking up the private monopolies and opening the public monopolies to competition, and lowering entry barriers that restrict access to the political arena.</seg>
		<seg id="33">These may not be sufficient conditions for success, but they are certainly necessary ones.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Calderón must strengthen his presidency from the outset.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Taking on the powers that be is perhaps the only way to achieve this, however risky it might appear.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Elected with only 35% of the vote, lacking a majority in Congress, and taking office on the eve of an economic slowdown in the United States, things would be difficult anyway.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Given that roughly a third of the electorate does not think he won fairly, and in view of the precariousness of the rule of law in the country, Calderón's position is even less enviable.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Caution and patience might not be his best advisors.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Chávez Challenge</seg>
		<seg id="1">Venezuela's recent legislative elections confirmed trends that have repeatedly brought the country into the headlines in recent years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">President Hugo Chávez showed once again that he enjoys broad support among the nation's poor and desperate, and that he is miles ahead of his opposition in terms of political skill, cunning, and ruthlessness.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yet at the same time voter turnout is declining with each passing election under Chávez, and the questionable fairness of the electoral process has grown increasingly apparent.</seg>
		<seg id="4">To be sure, the opposition's withdrawal from the election just days before the vote was, as Chávez claimed, more a symptom of its own weakness than of problems with the electoral process.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And, just as surely, that very weakness is a function of the gradual stifling of many features of Venezuela's traditional democratic order.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Even so, the opposition's mistakes have been massive, ranging from support for the failed coup against the democratically elected Chávez in April 2002 to the failed strike at PEDEVSA, Venezuela's national oil company, in early 2003.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Nothing is more lethal in politics than failure in direct confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In such circumstances, Chávez can afford to be bold, despite his policies' failure to benefit his core constituency: the more than 50% of Venezuelans who live in destitution and despair.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before, and, aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood &quot;barefoot doctor&quot; services, the overall welfare of the poor remains the same, if not worse.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Major changes are unlikely in the foreseeable future.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Chávez will be able to modify the Constitution largely as he pleases, and pack both the justice system and the electoral authority with his placemen.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He will continue to dole out oil-based subsidies in the well-worn Venezuelan tradition of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Carlos Andrés Pérez.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As a result, Chávez will be re-elected late next year, and he may well remain in power until the end of the next decade.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Yet, if this is what the Venezuelan people want, then so be it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is, after all, their business who governs them, and how, as long as human rights are not systematically violated, democratic institutions are not indefinitely suspended, and standard norms of international conduct are respects.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Judged by the last standard, at least, Chávez may have crossed the line.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For years, he has been accused of taking over where Fidel Castro left off: supporting the rhetoric of radicalism and anti-imperialism, if not revolution, throughout Latin America.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It could now be time for other Latin American nations and the international community to take such charges more seriously.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba, and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner's political fortunes.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In Mar del Plata, Argentina, last month, he openly participated in a rally against the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), in the company of, among others, Evo Morales, the coca-leaf growers' leader from Bolivia who might well become that country's next president.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Similarly, Chávez is clearly supporting Daniel Ortega, the perennial Sandinista presidential candidate in Nicaragua, and Shafick Handal, the equally perennial FMLN candidate in El Salvador.</seg>
		<seg id="22">His former ambassador to Mexico participated openly and vociferously in campaign events for Mexico City Mayor Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador's presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There seems to be a common thread to most of Chávez's foreign policy: to provoke a major confrontation with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The danger, of course, is that if and when confrontation comes -- over Bolivia, the FTAA, human rights, or press freedoms -- it will be too late to defuse it.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The challenge, then, lies in avoiding a confrontation that Chávez clearly wants.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Unfortunately, George W. Bush's administration has not proved particularly adept at conflict prevention.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The hemisphere's other nations have a direct stake in attempting to pre-empt a fight that would force them to take sides and might threaten their economic and national-security interests.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Although many of Chávez's positions have found support in certain Latin American nations, the division that he and Castro's Cuba have created in Latin America -- between left and right, free-traders and &quot;Bolivarians,&quot; and pro- and anti- Americans -- is mainly artificial and certainly not impossible to overcome.</seg>
		<seg id="29">To be sure, many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Chávez, and they have all failed.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But the cost of not trying again could be extremely high.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The last time revolutionary leaders confronted the US head-on, in Central America during the 1980's, everyone lost.</seg>
		<seg id="32">A new split up and down the hemisphere, engineered by a leader awash in oil money, would prove far more disastrous.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Nation State Revisited</seg>
		<seg id="1">It has become fashionable to claim that the nation state has lost its place.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Globalization, it is said, means that nations can no longer control their own affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">They must join with others, as in the European Union or ASEAN or Mercosur, and they must increasingly rely on global institutions like the United Nations, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But such a view is risky.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, on closer inspection, it proves to be dubious, when not simply wrong.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The nation state, with both its strengths and weaknesses, is alive and well.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To begin with its strengths, the nation state remains the only political space in which the constitution of liberty thrives.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The democratic credentials of organizations like the EU are doubtful, and entirely absent in the case of the UN and other world institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Moreover, despite the frequent search for new identities, European or Latin American or otherwise, and despite many references to a new cosmopolitanism, or even a &quot;world civil society,&quot; most people feel at home in their own country -- the nation state of which they are citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Migration is generally migration to other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants.</seg>
		<seg id="12">What does it take to be British or German or American?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Such debates about immigration make sense only if we recognize that citizenship is defined by and for nations.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is, for most people, the positive side of the nation state.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The nation state has been, and continues to be, the relevant unit of belonging and civic involvement for most human beings for more than two centuries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is the context in which we find our liberties safeguarded or destroyed.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Certainly, the countries freed from communism in 1989 felt that restoring national sovereignty and recovering liberty were bound together.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Yet there is, and always has been, another, uglier face of the nation state: nationalism.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The nationalist impulse can be aggressive or defensive, directed against others or inward-looking.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Either way, it vitiates all attempts to create an international community of open societies.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This was the problem in Iraq: a nation state had become a disturber of peace in the region and beyond.</seg>
		<seg id="22">More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Doha Round of trade negotiations is stalled because developed countries do not want to open their markets to cheaper products from developing countries, which in turn try to protect what nascent industries they have.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Many would prefer privileged relationships to open trade.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In this regard, the EU has often obliged.</seg>
		<seg id="26">But now the nationalist bug has infected the EU itself.</seg>
		<seg id="27">France, Spain, and Poland have attempted to keep major industries firmly in &quot;national hands.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Suddenly, the single European market is forgotten, and a return to fragmented markets is taking root.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Consider, for example, the European Commission's so-called &quot;services directive.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="30">Although freedom of movement for labor is one of the single market's &quot;four freedoms,&quot; many EU countries are trying to protect their domestic labor markets by suspending this freedom for as long as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Germany, in particular, argues that the high unemployment resulting from reunification in 1990 requires it to close its labor market to the new member states to its east.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Such trends are dangerous.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Historically, protectionism has often led to economic conflict, which can rapidly turn into more serious clashes.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The signs are not good, even in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="35">A recent summit of EU leaders addressed energy policy -- one area where cooperation is not only highly desirable, but necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yet even German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- clearly a pro-European -- went to the meeting with the explicit intention of barring the creation of other European powers in this field.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The German-Russian agreement to build a gas pipeline bypassing Poland and Lithuania, with former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder leading the effort, has already harmed Polish-German relations, to say nothing of European cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="38">For a time, the pendulum of political opinion may have swung too far against the nation state and its role.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This is one reason why so many people have felt estranged from their political leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But it would be unfortunate -- indeed, dangerous -- if the pendulum now swung back to old-fashioned nationalism.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Nation states are welcome; they are important elements of a liberal world order.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.</seg>
		<seg id="43">We must be vigilant in resisting the start of a trend reminiscent of developments in the early years of the twentieth century ­­ -- a trend that quickly led to global disaster.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is Gordon Brown Electable?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Gordon Brown obviously wants to succeed Tony Blair as British prime minister.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But it is less obvious that he is willing to do what is necessary to lead the Labour Party to victory in the next general election.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In some critical sense, he must repudiate Blair's legacy, which, at a minimum, means promising to take Britain out of the Iraq War.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Brown has longed to be prime minister ever since May 12, 1994, the fateful day when John Smith, the Labour Party's leader in opposition, dropped dead of a heart attack.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London, and debated who should take over the party leadership.</seg>
		<seg id="6">By the end of their discussion, they had made a double deal: Brown would stand aside and support Blair as the next party leader; in return, Blair would later give up the leadership to him.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Crucially, but inevitably, they did not agree when, or under what circumstances, Blair would fulfil his side of the bargain.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Inevitably, they could not foresee that Blair would go on to win an unprecedented three successive election victories for Labour, in 1997, 2001, and 2005, and thus keep Labour in power for a record-breaking period of possibly as long as 13 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The key challenge for New Labour (as Blair re-styled it with his characteristic gift for spin), was the management of the British economy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Since World War II, most British governments tried to manipulate the economy for short-term party advantage, usually with disastrous long-term results.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This lamentable tradition was common to both Conservatives and Labour; and yet, unfairly, it was the Labour Party that was most contaminated by the smear that it could not be trusted to manage the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Brown decisively changed that reputation.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He has been probably the most outstanding Chancellor of the Exchequer in British history, not because of any inspiration or genius, but simply because he has built on a new tradition of prioritizing low inflation, low interest rates, and stable government finances.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Brown understood that these priorities were essential, not just for the British economy, but also for the long-term prospects of Labour in power; and he entrenched this agenda by giving the Bank of England independent responsibility for keeping inflation low.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As a result, Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth, outperforming many of its European counterparts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Yet, despite economic success, it became steadily clearer that Blair's time was running out.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The electorate grew increasingly disillusioned with the unavoidable shortcomings of an over-familiar government, and the party grew increasingly discontented with a leader who had outstayed his welcome.</seg>
		<seg id="18">At first, Blair thought that he could claim the right to remain in power for a third full five-year term.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But the pressure on him to go has steadily risen, to the point where he has now almost promised to give up in the summer of 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But no one knows exactly when, or how, Blair will step down.</seg>
		<seg id="21">If there is a formal leadership contest, it seems likely that several rival candidates will aim to stand.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But almost all authoritative observers seem to agree that Brown is by far the most likely man to be the next Labour prime minister.</seg>
		<seg id="23">That is the easy part.</seg>
		<seg id="24">From that point on, no one seems certain whether Brown knows what to do, or has what it takes, to fight and win another general election for Labour.</seg>
		<seg id="25">His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged, but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He has remained dour and almost silent, visibly chafing with impatience to come into his inheritance, but offering no hint of what difference he would make when he does.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The one thing he cannot do is promises to continue Blair's policies.</seg>
		<seg id="28">If Brown offers more of the same, he will lose.</seg>
		<seg id="29">After ten years of Blair, he must offer one or more policies that mark a clear break.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The most obvious candidate for such a policy switch is Iraq: if Brown wants to win an election as Labour leader, he must renounce Blair's policy and announce the withdrawal, in short order, of British troops.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In tactical terms, this should be easy and obvious: whatever the deceitful and illegal reasons originally given for invading Iraq, everyone now knows that this war has proved a political, strategic, and moral catastrophe.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Everyone knows that it cannot be &quot;won,&quot; whatever that means, and Brown knows that both the war and Britain's servile subordination to the Bush administration are deeply unpopular in Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This is the issue that is crying out to be addressed: but so far none of the main political parties has dared touch it.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In the past three weeks, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives have all held their annual conferences.</seg>
		<seg id="35">All of them concentrated on domestic policies; none dared discuss Iraq, because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal, which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain's relationship with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Does Brown have the stomach to take on the risks involved in confronting the Iraq question?</seg>
		<seg id="37">Possibly not.</seg>
		<seg id="38">He may decide that it is too difficult, in which case he will be a lame duck prime minister, condemned to serve out the three years remaining in Labour's current term with no hope of winning the next election.</seg>
		<seg id="39">That is not what he planned when he struck his bargain with Blair back in 1994.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The New New Thing in Economics</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Great Depression brought John Maynard Keynes to the forefront of economic thought.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The key &quot;Keynesian&quot; insight was that private investment spending is inherently unstable--due to fads and fashions among investors, or because of shifts in the &quot;animal spirits&quot; of businessmen, or because falling prices disrupt the financial system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Keynesians thought that prudent monetary policy--central banks raising and lowering interest rates to diminish fluctuations in private investment spending--could go part of the way toward stabilizing the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But they also believed that government had to be willing to step in directly, through expansive fiscal policy, to keep the overall level of spending in an economy stable.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Such a policy, they believed, would forever banish the specter of large-scale mass unemployment, as in the Great Depression.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Moreover, near-full employment might effectively be guaranteed.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Keynesians foresaw that near-full employment raised the threat of inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">After all, why should workers and unions moderate wage demands if governments will boost spending whenever high unemployment looms?</seg>
		<seg id="9">One big curb on high wage demands--fear of being let go when unemployment rises--was gone.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What would replace it?</seg>
		<seg id="11">For the first post-1945 generation, the predominant answer was that corporatist social democracy would replace it.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unions would bow to government requests to moderate their demands for wage increases, and governments would bow to union demands for public spending and social insurance.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Keynesian thinking guaranteed that nothing like the Great Depression would ever return.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But its solution to the problem of creeping inflation was jury-rigged, and broke down completely in the 1970's.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the aftermath of the main industrial countries' burst of inflation in the 1970's, mainstream economic thought in the world's industrial core shifted into a &quot;semi-Monetarist&quot; channel.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Milton Friedman's victory was never as complete as the Keynesians' had been.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But by the mid-1980's policymakers throughout the world were assenting to the following propositions:</seg>
		<seg id="18">Central banks must make their commitments to long-run price stability credible;</seg>
		<seg id="19">Central banks must accept that the average level of unemployment is determined not by cyclical factors, but by &quot;structural&quot; factors, which they have no business trying to address;</seg>
		<seg id="20">Announcing and trying to maintain a money-supply growth target is an easy way for a central bank to communicate its principal intentions, gain credibility, and give outsiders a way to check whether sound policies are really being followed.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Monetarism was the mirror image of Keynesianism.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It seemingly guaranteed that nothing like the inflation of the 1970's would ever return.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But it offered no solution to the problem of structural unemployment that arose in western Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The past decade and a half demonstrated that monetarism is as ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of falling prices in the context of highly-leveraged firms and banks as the Keynesian prescription was ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Back in the 1970's and at the start of the 1980's, many (I was one) blamed bad decisions for the breakdown of the social-democratic systems' ability to control inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Politicians did not understand that expanding social insurance was the inevitable price of wage restraint, while union leaders did not understand that if corporatist social democracy did not restrain inflation, political power would shift to the right and high unemployment would be used to restrain it.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Today, many blame today's alarming economic conditions in the world's industrial core--more than a decade of stagnation in Japan, deflation there and in Germany, recession in Germany--on other bad decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Japanese and European central bankers did not lower interest rates far enough fast enough, banking-sector regulators shied at the jump in speculative lending, and politicians were unwilling to expand fiscal policy sufficiently.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But politicians and central bank governors cannot always be expected to make good decisions: good policies must be designed to function even when rulers are short-sighted and badly advised.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The inflation of the 1970's was a natural failure of Keynesian political economy.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The deflation that threatens Japan, Europe, and perhaps the US with the prospect of a long period of large gaps between potential and actual output is a natural failure of the semi-Monetarist orthodoxy that governed macroeconomic policy in the world's industrial core since the early 1980's.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Round and round we go.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But it's not quite a circle: no government would allow a repeat of the liquidity collapse seen in the 1930's, or the failure of banks and companies on a scale that puts the entire financial system at hazard.</seg>
		<seg id="34">It is an upward spiral.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The world's macroeconomic problems are real, but they will not lead to another Great Depression--in large part because policymakers remember that there once was a Great Depression.</seg>
		<seg id="36">We need another policy-making revolution like the Keynesian and semi-Monetarist ones, a revolution that will not (wholly) lose sight of its predecessor's achievements, but will eliminate its natural failures.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Where might that revolution come from?</seg>
		<seg id="38">Perhaps the next revolution in economics will grow out of US Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke's career-long concern with asset prices, the role of adverse selection in credit markets, and the need for central banks in difficult situations to do more than conduct short-term open-market operations.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He believes that banks should try things like putting a floor beneath key long-term bond prices.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Bernankeism, anyone?</seg>

		<seg id="1">For quite a while now—certainly since the terrorist attacks on the US of September 11, 2001, and before as we watched the slaughters in Kosovo, Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Rwanda, and Congo on our televisions—the news has been dominated by war and rumors of war, by violent death and threats of violent death.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Everyone, everywhere is keenly aware of the power of our weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="3">From nuclear-tipped missiles down to trucks full of fertilizer or explosives worn as belts, we have used our technology to amplify greatly the dark parts of our nature as a violent—and not even a properly predatory—species.</seg>
		<seg id="4">I certainly do not want to downplay or dismiss this side of humanity's history and our current events.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I do not want anyone to forget that over less than half of the years contained in the past century—from the outbreak of World War I to the famine that followed Mao's &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;—about one in every ten people alive on this planet was shot, gassed, stabbed, burned, or starved to death by his or her fellow human beings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But that is not the whole story.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indeed, the human abattoirs of the twentieth century—and even the slaughterhouses that various humans are preparing now—may not appear from the perspective of the future to be the most important part of our experience and condition, and of what our descendants will regard as their history.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For them, the most important features of what our experience may instead be:</seg>
		<seg id="9">For most of the twentieth century, large chunks of the world remained desperately poor for one or more of four related reasons: (1) criminal misgovernment; (2) lack of the machines to do anything useful and productive in the world economy besides subsistence agriculture and unskilled service work; (3) lack of the public education system needed to give people the literacy and the skills to operate the machines; and (4) barriers (legal and physical) that kept people where demand was low from selling the products of their work where demand was high.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But over the course of the late twentieth century, these four causes of desperate poverty have largely fallen away.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Governments as bad as Kim Jong-Il's in North Korea are now extremely rare.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Nearly all countries in the world are at most one generation away from near-universal literacy.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The fast pace of technological progress has created a cornucopia of invention and innovation that is open to every place that can send someone away to get a master's degree in engineering.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Most important, the barriers to making goods and services in Mauritius, Mozambique, or Mauritania and selling them in New York or Berlin, Santiago or Tokyo are dropping swiftly.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The gargantuan container ships that first appeared a generation ago brought one revolution to world trade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The use of information technology to manage transportation and distribution channels is likely to have a similarly profound effect.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, the advent of the Internet and the fiber-optic cable will do as much to make service-sector work internationally tradable as the coming of the iron-hulled steamship a century and a half ago did to make bulk agricultural products and manufactures internationally tradable.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It will take at least a generation for these changes to make themselves felt in most corners of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But inside the industrial core of the world's rich countries there is already concern about these looming revolutions.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Indeed, this concern will only become sharper and stronger, as citizens in rich countries fear that as the remaining barriers to international trade fall, industrial-core income distributions, social orders, and politics will be shaken to their foundations.</seg>
		<seg id="21">For the world as a whole, however, the next two generations are ones that will bring an extraordinary opportunity for economic growth and world prosperity.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Perhaps at the end of history there is a pot of gold, after all.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Neo-liberalism's Argentine Failure</seg>
		<seg id="1">In the 1990s Argentina implemented perhaps 80% of the neoliberal economic policy agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It opened up its economy to world trade and international capital; it sought to guarantee low inflation and sound money.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It strove to improve its legal system so that decisions would accord with general rules and foster confidence that contracts would be enforced--whether or not a bribe had been paid.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It failed.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This is not to say that the 1990s, even with their aftermath leading into the terrible summer of 2002, were catastrophic.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Life was clearly worse during the Dirty War of the 1970s, when an army with no honor threw women out of helicopters into the South Atlantic, and urban guerrillas shot people because... because... well, just because!</seg>
		<seg id="7">The 1980s were hardly better.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Starting with a full-fledged debt crisis triggered by a massive rise in both US interest rates and the value of the American dollar, the decade ended with domestically-generated hyperinflation, causing Argentina to fall a decade further behind the world's leading economies.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In the 1990s, by contrast, Argentina's GDP per capita grow by 25% from trough to peak--only to lose this entire income gain over the past four years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Until late last winter, Argentina's problems seemed merely an unpleasant but temporary bump, in the same way that the 1994-1995 Mexican &quot;tequila&quot; crisis or the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 proved to be only temporary interruptions, not watersheds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Such optimism is impossible today, and there is little hope that the country's recent meltdown is only temporary.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The establishment view--say, in US Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor's office--is that Argentina's collapse is the fault of its politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I half-agree with this view.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Argentine leaders were repeatedly warned that keeping the exchange rate constant and fixing the peso's value against the US dollar risked sending the economy into recession if the dollar gained value.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Argentine politicians were also warned that their peso policy could not be sustained unless the ratio of national debt to GDP was falling.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Yet during the boom years of 1993-1998, public spending outran taxes enough to push Argentina's debt-to-GDP ratio from 29 to 44%.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When the dollar appreciated and recession came, politicians with too little statesmanship to balance the budget in good times turned out to have too little courage to balance the budget when times turned hard.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The coup de grâce was delivered by the government's decision (when the crisis came) to keep bank deposits fixed in dollars and to change debts owed to banks into pesos, thereby bankrupting the country's financial system with a single stroke of the pen.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The establishment position is that if any of these three disastrous policies had not been implemented, Argentina would not have fallen into crisis, or at worst it would have suffered a small tequila-style crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Argentina's 1990's neo-liberal program was nearly idiot-proof, according to this view, but Argentine politicians turned out to form a large and ingenious class of idiots.</seg>
		<seg id="21">There is, however, another way of looking at the Argentine tragedy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is based on the observation that the country's political system has long performed in a predictable way, consistently producing governments that promise more than they can deliver.</seg>
		<seg id="23">They promise rich oligarchs that they will not collect much in taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="24">They promise workers and consumers generous social insurance.</seg>
		<seg id="25">They promise rapid economic development, generous infrastructure spending, cushy low-work jobs for the politically connected, and so forth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Taken together, these promises mean that claims on national product always exceed 100% of the total.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Popular demands that the government fulfills all of them cannot possibly be met.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Add to this an unfair distribution of income and wealth, lack of social comity between the working and middle classes, and a long tradition of political violence, and you have the recipe for a politics of all-against-all.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The basic political fight about how wealth should be distributed in Argentina remains unresolved.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Any political force that tries to curb the bidding by promising only what it can deliver is doomed to defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="31">So in Argentina big government deficits are a law of nature, a fact of life.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Hence Argentine interest rates can be low and affordable only for rare, short periods.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Everyone knew that Argentina's political system generates chronic deficits, and this meant that interest payments on the debt were likely to explode.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Because the dynamics of Argentine debt were so unstable, a hard-currency exchange-rate peg could not last.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Free access to international capital markets and dollar-denominated bank accounts meant that when the  -rate peg finally collided with the deficit-producing logic of Argentine politics, the result could be nothing short of catastrophic.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Had today's crisis been finessed, had Argentina another decade of rapid growth, its conflicts over wealth distribution might have moderated.</seg>
		<seg id="37">After all, Europe before WWII possessed the nastiest politics on earth: rioting right-wing mobs in France, general strikes in Britain, civil war in Spain, fascism in Italy, and the Nazis' vicious consolidation of power in Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Yet postwar Western Europe encountered no public problems that could not be resolved in ways that preserved sound money and growth.</seg>
		<seg id="39">I half-agree with this view, too.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Yes, Argentina's government made huge mistakes; its politicians sinned against the gods of monetary economics.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But did the punishment need to be so swift and so severe?</seg>

		<seg id="0">The False Promise of Private Pensions</seg>
		<seg id="1">One of the strangest claims made in the debates about social insurance now roiling the world's richest countries is the that government-funded defined-benefit pension programs (such as America's Social Security system) are outmoded.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today's high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Advocates of this argument propose a different model.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Just as corporations today are much happier supporting workers' pensions by contributing to employees' private accounts, so governments today should offer (or require) contributions to privately owned accounts.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The value of these accounts would fluctuate with the market rather than resting on a defined-benefit scheme that guarantees a fixed real sum of resources available upon retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This argument is strange because it gets the economics of the situation backward.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When there are lots of companies offering workers long-term defined-benefit retirement pensions, there are fewer advantages to the government in setting up a parallel defined-benefit scheme and requiring workers to participate in it.</seg>
		<seg id="8">After all, in such a world, workers who set great value on a defined-benefit pension can go to work for firms that offer such pensions.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The major benefits that arise from the government's requiring that workers also participate in a national Social Security system accrue to those workers who really ought to value a defined-benefit pension highly but have not been able to figure out what their true preferences are.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They also accrue to relatively poor workers who lack the bargaining power to induce bosses to offer the pensions they really want -- and need.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there aren't a lot of companies today that are willing to offer long-term defined-benefit pension schemes.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-run fragility than they were in the post-World War II decades.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Not even America's IBM -- which prides itself on stability -- wants to take the risk of offering defined-benefit schemes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The risk from defined-benefit pensions used to be offset by two benefits for companies that offered them.</seg>
		<seg id="15">First, the fact that leaving the company usually meant cashing in one's pension at a discount increased worker loyalty.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Second, complaisant accountants' optimistic assumptions about returns on pension reserves, together with large firms' greater risk-bearing capacity, brightened the financial picture that companies could report to investors.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Today, the risks are seen to be much greater, and the benefits are seen to be less.</seg>
		<seg id="18">As a result, an ever-smaller slice of employers are offering anything like defined-benefit pensions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This fall-off in private defined-benefit pensions all across the rich core of the world economy is a bad thing, because the configuration of asset prices suggests that young and middle-aged workers value defined-benefit pensions extremely highly.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Historically, the gap between expected returns on low-risk assets like government or investment-grade bonds and high-risk assets like stocks and real estate has been very high.</seg>
		<seg id="21">To some degree, as economists like Harvard's Robert Barro and mathematicians like Benoit Mandelbrot argue, this may be because high-risk investments are in reality much more risky than the theories and math of standard finance techniques suggest.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In my opinion, at least, this is partly because the memory of years like 1930 and 2000, when stocks performed very badly, occupies too large a place in investors' minds.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety, security, and predictability, so a defined-benefit pension plan is extremely valuable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But in today's world, only national governments are large enough to be able to do so with any assurance that the pension assets will actually be there when workers retire.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I am enough of a social democrat to believe that if there is an economic service or benefit that citizens value extremely highly and that only the government can provide, then the government should provide it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">We economists know that there are many drawbacks to expanding government beyond its basic role of providing true public goods like defense, public safety, and justice, as well as providing citizens with incentives to counterbalance the effects of true market failures.</seg>
		<seg id="27">If the private market has the flexibility of two hands, government bureaucracy has at best two thumbs.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But the collection of payroll taxes from tens of millions of workers and the writing of tens of millions of pension checks is the kind of routine, semi-automatic task that government can do well.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With private companies backing away from defined-benefit programs, it is even more important and valuable that government do it in our post-industrial network-age society than it was in the past.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Islamic Democratic Paradox</seg>
		<seg id="1">The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark (months ago) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran's politics, has made &quot;political Islam&quot; a fundamental question of international diplomacy.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But a one-size-fits-all response won't work.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, we need to abandon the idea that there is a holistic or global Islamist movement.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Political Islam of all colors has emerged as the main alternative to secular Arab nationalist regimes whose legitimacy, based on the struggle for national liberation, has evaporated due to their inability to resolve economic and social problems, establish the rule of law, and guarantee fundamental freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In Palestine, for example, the Islamists triumphed over Fatah because of years of bad governance under the harsh conditions spawned by Israeli occupation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Successive European and American governments share an atavistic fear of the &quot;Islamic alternative&quot; to Arab secular nationalists like Fatah, and so have defended the status quo.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But repression of all Arab opposition movements by the region's monarchs and secular dictators meant that &quot;protection of the Mosque&quot; became the only umbrella under which to engage politically.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now political Islam can no longer be contained, because democracy cannot be built by driving underground parties that have a strong social base, as was tragically demonstrated in Algeria 15 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The only alternative to authoritarianism is to craft a transition that allows Islamists to participate in public life and encourages them to accept unequivocally the rules of the democratic game.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There are already many examples of more or less conservative Islamist parties that are willing to play along.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform, including Lebanon, where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government, as well as Jordan and Morocco.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has become a strong force in parliament despite the limits imposed on the participation of Islamist groups in last year's elections.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In Iraq, free elections have revealed the enormous influence of Islamist currents.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In Turkey, the transition to democracy led the Islamist Justice and Development Party to power.</seg>
		<seg id="15">That government has undertaken various important democratic reforms and initiated accession negotiations with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="16">These Islamist parties have nothing to do with Al Qaeda, even though some of the most conservative among them have adopted somewhat similar ideological positions.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The risk of political transitions that may lead to the victory of Islamist parties is a democratic paradox that Europe and the US must accept if they are to devise inclusive reform policies -- in other words, policies that are the polar opposite of the type of democratic imposition practiced in occupied Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Indeed, one of the less fortunate consequences of the intervention in Iraq was to reinforce the notion of a &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; between the West from Islam, which in turn serves to create a climate favorable to Islamist movements.</seg>
		<seg id="19">After all, political reform movements in the Muslim world emerged long before the US-led &quot;war on terror,&quot; and reformists were not waiting for the EU to become stronger to press for change.</seg>
		<seg id="20">These movements were not created in the US or Europe after September 11, 2001, and they will not wait for or depend on the US or the EU to act.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Nevertheless, the success of Muslim moderates may well depend on how the EU and the US respond to pressure for reform and how they decide to encourage change.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This depends largely on the new Hamas government and its transformation into a democratic force that respects the rule of law, democracy, and international legality.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But it also depends on Israel and the international community, which must do all they can to ensure a future Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Supporting Palestinian democratization does not mean that the international community should not demand that Hamas abandon terror for once and for all, demilitarize, respect the Palestinian constitution, and accept the existence of the state of Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="26">But it also does not mean supporting sanctions that would hurt the Palestinian people after they have expressed their will democratically.</seg>
		<seg id="27">This would be a terrible mistake in any effort to consolidate Palestine's new democracy, with a negative impact in other reforming countries in the Arab world.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Similarly, accepting the right of non-violent Islamists to participate in public life does not mean giving up on the political and ideological struggle to defeat ultra-conservative, and in some cases totalitarian, conceptions of society.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Combating racism, promoting tolerance, and respecting the religious sentiments of others does not mean that we need to question press freedom or accept Islamists' demands for censorship, even when real religious sentiments are offended, as in the case of the Danish caricatures.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Islamist conceptions of society that violate individual rights must be rebutted politically.</seg>
		<seg id="31">That political challenge is one of the paradoxes of democracy, which allows all ideas to compete freely with each other.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Political Islam is a risk, but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent, case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy, not by denouncing the results of democratic choice.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The War on &quot;Democratization&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">The wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean.</seg>
		<seg id="2">These wars are inflicting heavy punishment on precisely those peoples who have held fully free and fair elections in the region, while eroding the legitimacy of Israel's democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At the time of its &quot;Cedar Revolution&quot; last year, Lebanon was held up as the best example so far of democratization in the Arab world.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The enthusiasm with which the international community welcomed those changes now seems all but forgotten, which is also true of recent elections in Palestine -- another longstanding international demand.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The signal being sent is clear: it is preferable that Israel, the only state in the region that abides by the rule of law, be surrounded by authoritarian regimes where political outcomes are predictable than by democratic states where Islamists may well rise to power.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It happened in Palestine, and it could well happen in Egypt if free and fair free elections were held.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As a result, Arab nationalist governments feel justified in resisting serious political reform and vindicated in repressing all domestic opposition, particularly the swelling Islamist movements.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But it should now be clear to everyone that democratization in the southern Mediterranean cannot bypass Islamist movements, and that the success of that process largely depends on the degree to which their full participation in the political arena is ensured.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Of course, this requires their renouncing violence as a means of achieving power.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Repressing political Islam, or attempting to &quot;erase&quot; Islamists militarily with total disregard for national political processes (not to mention human life), is not the answer, because it won't persuade electorates to turn away from Islamist movements.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Democracies have long known that extreme and indiscriminate punishment -- which by definition affects friend and foe, combatant and civilian alike -- is a grave violation of international law, as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, has pointed out.</seg>
		<seg id="13">They also know that such action fuels radicalism, leading to the kind of tragic consequences that are all too familiar nowadays.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Hezbollah is, after all, a creature of Lebanon's resistance to Israel's 1982 invasion, now trying to reassert its influence at home and in the wider region by portraying itself as a champion of the Arab-Islamic cause, namely in Palestine.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Any reinforcement of its power will necessarily weaken Lebanon and the region's democratic forces.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The prolonged absence of the United States from truly active engagement in the Middle East peace process is partly to blame for the current situation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For almost six years, there has been no significant US diplomatic initiative to resolve the Palestinian question or to pursue the Syrian track (Israel still occupies the Golan Heights).</seg>
		<seg id="18">Moreover, just when we were beginning to think that the Iraqi tragedy had made the limits of unilateralism and preemptive military strategies clear to all, the Bush administration encourages Israel's military action -- this time against a country that has painfully been attempting to consolidate democratic reform and to reafirm its sovereignty in relation to Syria .</seg>
		<seg id="19">Bush's most promising initiative, promoting democracy across the Middle East, was already dealt a crippling blow by US intervention in Iraq and the ensuing civil war there.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Now the project is buried under the weight of America's inability to protect Lebanon's fragile democracy and Palestine's democratic experiment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The European Union's feeble response to the warfare in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate use of force by Israel (described as &quot;ten eyes for one&quot; by the Finnish presidency), thereby betraying its dependence on the US to end the violence.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Europeans will have learned nothing from the damaging disunity, and thus weakness, that they displayed during the Iraq war if this conflict does not compel them to speak with one voice.</seg>
		<seg id="23">What is needed is a European initiative that is backed by a credible military deterrent, consisting of forces from the EU, Turkey, and Arab countries, to be dispatched under a UN mandate to Lebanon and Gaza.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Europe must not only put forward a clear demand for an immediate cease-fire and the end to Syrian and Iranian meddling in Lebanon, it must also provide the means to enforce it as well as massive support for Lebanon's reconstruction.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The EU should decisively back the end of the embargo on Palestine and the urgent creation of a Palestinian state.</seg>
		<seg id="26">A common European front could persuade the US to give Lebanon and Palestine enough time to consolidate their national democratic processes, thus isolating the radical elements of Hamas and steering Hezbollah to dissolution of its private army.</seg>
		<seg id="27">With the US project in ruins, a credible European policy to delegitimize war and support democratization in its neighborhood has become essential.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Environment of the Economy</seg>
		<seg id="1">No economy is a closed, autonomous universe, governed by rules independent from law, morals, and politics.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Indeed, the most interesting economic questions are generally located on the borderline with neighboring disciplines.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But nowhere is this clearer than in the interaction between economic processes and the natural environment.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The distinctive feature of this exchange is that it is governed not by the laws of mechanics, but by thermodynamics, particularly the law of entropy, according to which the quantity of free energy that can be transformed into mechanical work diminishes with time -- an irreversible process culminating in &quot;heat death.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">Numerous researchers, inspired by the late Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's pioneering work on the relationship between economic processes and physics, tried -- not very successfully -- to formulate an &quot;entropic&quot; theory of economy and society, especially during the 1970's.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The entropic view assumes that economic processes produce irreversible consequences because of their multiple interactions with nature.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We draw from stocks of non-renewable natural resources (for example, oil and metal ores), and we deteriorate or modify the quality of other resources (for example, water and arable land) by imposing on them a rhythm of exploitation superior to their capacity for regeneration.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In fact, the exploitation of non-renewable resources frees the speed of economic growth from that of ecological renewal, aggravating the deterioration of the biosphere, including irreversible climate changes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The law of entropy reminds us that we will leave to future generations a degraded natural patrimony, probably less adequate to their needs than what we inherited.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Unfortunately, there are no simple answers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For the sake of what principle can we ask China and India, for example, to limit their economic dynamism so that they use smaller amounts of the planet's natural resources?</seg>
		<seg id="12">After all, the advanced countries' slower growth is not the consequence of voluntary self-limitation, but of our superior standard of living -- and of our incapacity to settle our own economic imbalances.</seg>
		<seg id="13">We cannot impose an ecological rhythm on people who are poorer than we are when it is the very fact that we freed ourselves from that rhythm that made us richer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Economic contraction, or even stagnation, is not a solution for the developed countries, either, for a similar reason: it would imply that we either accept existing inequalities or impose a regime aiming at an equal redistribution of resources.</seg>
		<seg id="15">That choice boils down to an unbearable cynicism or a totalitarian utopia.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But, happily for us, our evolution is determined not only by entropy, but also by the accumulation of knowledge and technological progress -- a process that is just as irreversible as the decrease in stocks of non-renewable resources and the degradation of environmental quality.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Thus, the economy is entropic for resources and historical for the production, organization, and spread of knowledge, with the prospects for economic and environmental sustainability residing in the space left between those two dynamic processes: the level of growth we choose must be conditioned on a sufficient level of knowledge to ensure the system's survival.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Yet nature, like knowledge, is a public good that needs state intervention to be &quot;produced&quot; in sufficient quantities.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The only way to overcome the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research aimed at increasing renewable energies, reducing the energy intensity of our standards of living, and slowing the pace of environmental erosion.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is widely believed that such a strategy would be useless if the only effect is to allow others to get rich faster by opting out.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But if that strategy is conceived as mastering two dynamic processes, overcoming the ecological constraint could be an accelerator of growth.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Stem-Cell Race Continues</seg>
		<seg id="1">Scientific research is usually conducted to improve our lives, but it is also an industry, one that represents a massive investment by governments and corporations alike.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The stakes and potential rewards for a few research topics are exceptionally high, which is why the recent finding that the Korean scientist Hwang Woo-suk fabricated the results of his work on stem cells has reverberated so widely.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The episode highlights the ongoing race in global health research that is playing out in the field of stem cells.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Possibly one of the biggest prizes in medical history is up for grabs, and anyone -- truly anyone -- could seize it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The last big scientific race of this type was the effort to map the human genome, which promises to alter future lives radically.</seg>
		<seg id="6">That study was initiated by the United States, which used insights developed in the wake of the atomic bombing of Japan to understand the extent of long-term genetic damage.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The current research effort on stem cells and their potential is just as grand, because it will lead to an equally radical medical revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A stem cell is special because it is able to reproduce a form that is different from itself.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Whereas a skin cell or a liver cell, for instance, can reproduce only more skin or liver, stem cells, which are the most robust at the beginning of human development, are &quot;master&quot; cells.</seg>
		<seg id="10">As a fertilized egg turns into an embryo, and then a fetus, those initial stem cells somehow show their daughter cells how to become skin, liver, eye, or bone.</seg>
		<seg id="11">We need to know how this transformation is activated.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Such knowledge would lead to huge, patentable advances.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Most attention is focused on genetic diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and to muscular dystrophy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In these cases, stem cells would be encouraged to restore nerve tissue.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This would also benefit patients with brain and spinal injuries, or those who have suffered strokes and paralysis.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There would be gains in parallel fields, too, such as gene therapy.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A stem cell changes its identity through a process of &quot;triggering&quot; -- a signal literally &quot;turns on&quot; the liver cell gene inside the stem version.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When scientists figure out how to flip these switches, it might be possible to introduce stem cells into the body and activate them so that they correctly replace damaged tissue, whatever it is.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Not surprisingly, given its huge potential, teams of scientists have been mobilized almost everywhere for embryonic stem cell research.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The race has become all the more dramatic since the leading researcher, the US, dropped out, owing to the influence of religion on politics (although the state of California has decided not to miss out, and recently approved a $3 billion subsidy for embryonic stem cell research).</seg>
		<seg id="21">Because the promise is so great, and the science does not require massive infrastructure, many smaller countries have rushed to take advantage of the absence of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Any competent medical research center can enter the race, whether in Mexico, Ethiopia, Indonesia or Yemen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Whoever wins will have added the equivalent of a Saudi oil field to their economy.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But, although anyone can win, science at this level is never a &quot;eureka&quot; event, with some single breakthrough suddenly ending the race.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Discoveries occur incrementally, and, because it is science, each step is announced and tested.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Research establishments gain momentum this way, with the leaders sweeping up talent, resources, and prestige in a rough-and-tumble intellectual ecology.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Embedded in the larger race are many smaller ones, which jostle for early, impressive results.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In May 2005, Hwang's research center in Seoul reported the first major achievement.</seg>
		<seg id="29">They claimed that they had developed a technique whereby new, perfect stem cells could be cloned from ordinary ones.</seg>
		<seg id="30">This was big news, for it implied that sufficient numbers of stem cells could be made without controversy, thus allowing anyone to be able to do quality research while avoiding what US President George W. Bush described as &quot;taking a life to save a life.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="31">More importantly, the Koreans did a common thing these days: they claimed patent rights over the process.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It almost looked for a moment as though South Korea would become a world superpower in health matters.</seg>
		<seg id="33">We now know that the Seoul researchers made up the whole thing.</seg>
		<seg id="34">An investigation by a Seoul National University investigative panel has concluded that the &quot;cloned&quot; stem cells were really created by test-tube fertilizations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The fraud has bewildered the science community, particularly because the claim that the Korean researchers made was so transparently false.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Why, then, did they place their reputations and careers in jeopardy?</seg>
		<seg id="37">Medical research has always faced many challenges, even when the scientific quest was simply one of discovery.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Now, the challenges are complicated by politics, market forces, and national interests.</seg>
		<seg id="39">With stem cell research, huge fortunes depend on which group takes the lead, wherever their laboratory is located.</seg>
		<seg id="40">As the competition heats up, we should expect amazing developments -- and no doubt more public relations gimmicks.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Islam versus Asia's Chinese Diaspora</seg>
		<seg id="1">When Malaysia's prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamed, recently announced that he intended to resign, Malaysians of Chinese descent joined Mahathir's Malay party loyalists in demanding that he reconsider.</seg>
		<seg id="2">When Mahathir agreed to stay on, if only for another 16 months, the sighs of relief from these Chinese Malaysians were the loudest of all.</seg>
		<seg id="3">That ethnic Chinese Malaysians rallied to Dr. Mahathir's side marks a quiet revolution in Malaysian politics, one that demonstrates how much Mahathir's nationalist image has softened during his 22 years in power.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It also shows how much Malaysia's ethnic Chinese have changed in their views about the nationalist movement that once seemed so antagonistic to them.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When Southeast Asia's colonial rulers were overthrown four decades ago, ethnic Chinese often shunned the nationalist movements that fought for independence.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Some movements saw the local Chinese as outsiders or as intrinsically disloyal for seeming to have benefited disproportionately during the years of imperial rule.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Across the region, anti-Chinese communal violence was widespread.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the decades since, many Chinese remained suspicious of political parties with ties to the former national liberation movements.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In Malaysia, that fear is dissipating.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Malaysia's Chinese citizens now view Premier Mahathir as a bastion against a new form of violent extremism: the threat posed by Muslim fundamentalism.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Such a bulwark is something members of the vast Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia need, not only in Malaysia, where Islamic extremism remains a small threat, but in Indonesia, where thousands of Chinese have been killed and injured in rioting in recent years, and where thousands more have seen their property damaged or lost.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Among most of Southeast Asia's ethnic Chinese, the presence of even a hint of allegiance to a secular distinction between faith and state in a Muslim leader is admired like a precious gem.</seg>
		<seg id="13">When found among Islamic believers like Mahathir, evidence of secular tolerance represents a rare sign of modernity and commitment to progress.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Dr. Mahathir has always been a hard-headed modernist.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Lately, he has begun to admit that the &quot;Malay first&quot; policies he has promoted since 1969 have failed to produce the skilled Malay elite essential to a modern knowledge economy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mahathir calls for young Malays to work harder, despite knowing that this is an unpopular thing to say.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Much of this new tone in Malaysia's ethnic politics has gone unnoticed due to the furor surrounding Mahathir's efforts to discredit his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This campaign to denigrate Mr. Anwar cost Mahathir's party, the United Malay National Organization (UMNO), much support among ethnic Malays.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Indeed, during the 1999 national elections, Mahathir retained power only with the help of Chinese voters.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Now non-Malays hope that he will reconsider the idea of special treatment for ethnic Malays.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Such reform, however, remains anathema among Malays.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Malaysia's ethnic Chinese are also impressed by Dr. Mahathir's skillful response to American demands to combat terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Premier used this opportunity to soften his anti-Western image by re-affirming his modernist and secular position against those who sympathized with Islamic extremism.</seg>
		<seg id="24">By doing so he revitalized the multi-cultural base of the National Alliance that has ruled Malaysia since independence in 1957.</seg>
		<seg id="25">All of this helped rally Malaysia's Chinese community to his side.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Contrast this with the Chinese in Indonesia, a country where everything secular and modern is associated with political and cultural conformity to the nation-state.</seg>
		<seg id="27">For thirty years, former President Suharto systematically discriminated against ethnic Chinese, while at the same time favoring a few select Chinese cronies, who helped his family and military colleagues make huge, ill-gotten profits.</seg>
		<seg id="28">For the indigenous majority who remained poor, such cronyism spawned an image of the Chinese as corrupt and unscrupulously greedy.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Despite memories of the slaughter of Chinese during the anti-communist purges of the 1960s, Indonesia's Chinese were unprepared for the intense hatred shown in the riots of May 1998, when arson and looting, as well as gang rapes of numerous Chinese women, battered the Chinese community.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Such violence still casts a shadow over ethnic relations in Indonesia.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Successive Indonesian governments headed by Presidents Habibie, Abdulrahman Wahid and Megawati Sukarnoputri all welcomed the Chinese to play their customary leading role in business.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Yet Indonesian officials waver from assuring the Chinese that they retain equal rights as citizens, and they have allowed various forms of discrimination to run rampant.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Today's tensions between Indonesia's secularists, religious believers, and various Muslim extremist groups has taken the spotlight off the Chinese, allowing many to resume their economic role under conditions of growing uncertainty.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But the personal security they crave, and which Malaysia's ethnic Chinese are achieving, is as far away as ever.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Indeed, Indonesia is unlikely any time soon to produce a leader they can depend upon in ways that Malaysia's Chinese now rely upon Premier Mahathir.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Gooooal!!!</seg>
		<seg id="2">Heavenly bliss, or hellish pain, depending on which team has scored: ours, or theirs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How can the trajectory of a ball cause so much pain or bliss?</seg>
		<seg id="4">For weeks I have sat at my television watching the World Cup.</seg>
		<seg id="5">My wife threatens me with divorce and other disciplinary measures.</seg>
		<seg id="6">What is the source of this attraction, this magic?</seg>
		<seg id="7">The world of play is our permanent Garden of Eden.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At any moment we may step from our real world into the freedom, innocence, and bliss of play.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Football and the Garden of Eden?</seg>
		<seg id="10">What do they have to do with each other?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Each delineates a sacred sphere of freedom and order, innocence, spirituality and justice from our everyday world of chaos, bondage, injustice and guilt.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The chessboard, the tennis court, the soccer field: within their boundaries we feel free because here it is we who make the rules and are not subjected to the iron laws of the outside world.</seg>
		<seg id="13">We feel innocent too, because the world of play is also a world of innocence: a Garden of Eden before the Fall.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Here we can be childishly selfish, we can gratify our thirst for success, power and domination - all without guilt.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the world of play freedom is generated, paradoxically, by restrictions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In soccer, the basic rule is simple: the ball is to be moved, from the central point, into one of the goals.</seg>
		<seg id="17">If the ball would roll from the center point straight into one of the goals, its track would be, or would seem to be, strictly determined and the whole thing would be boring.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To generate freedom, rules put obstacles in the way of the ball and complicate its movement.</seg>
		<seg id="19">First, two teams of eleven players are put on the field with the task of getting the ball into the goal.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Second, they are told to get the ball into opposite goals.</seg>
		<seg id="21">With twenty-two players with their own wills and skills, with various movements of confrontation and cooperation, the number of possible combinations is increased almost ad infinitum.</seg>
		<seg id="22">After this only one additional factor is needed to create a real world of happy surprises, freedom and bliss: the ball.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Balls are among the most important &quot;freedom generators&quot; in our lives.</seg>
		<seg id="24">A ball is freedom embodied.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It may bounce in any direction.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It seems to have its &quot;own will.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is an object and, nevertheless, it seems to be free.</seg>
		<seg id="28">By introducing the factor of chance and unpredictability into the game, the ball transforms a bitter and down-to-earth human fight into an epiphany of spirituality and freedom.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In its brisk movements chance and human will interact, dance, and somersault with each other.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The ball flashes to and fro in happy irresponsibility - between human will and chance, freedom and limitation, success and failure, hope and the loss of hope - to bounce back into the world of hope in the next moment.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It has its own universe.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It moves in the sphere of the sacred.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But that sacred does not exist without the profane.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The football field is marked off and opposed to the surrounding world.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The experience and the sacred ceremony remain incomplete if tension between the field and the grandstand is missing.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The clean emerald field and freedom of the game must be opposed by the howling mob in the darkness of the stands, burning red torches and jerking between ecstatic joy and hellish misery.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In our everyday lives, reason and passions are mixed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Soccer (like some other games) separates, and opposes to each other, these two realms.</seg>
		<seg id="39">All passions, emotions and instincts are pushed over to the side of the spectators.</seg>
		<seg id="40">They rage and love, prance and explode, and finally reach a catharsis (if their team wins) or to descend into hell (if their team loses ).</seg>
		<seg id="41">At the same time, they watch, perceive, and experience the freedom of Apollonian or Platonic spirituality of the game going on in the field.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Yes, players move in a world of spirituality.</seg>
		<seg id="43">They act according to clear, sacred rules.</seg>
		<seg id="44">While in play, they are supposed to act as pure rational beings who leave behind their everyday passions and emotions, personal wishes or fears.</seg>
		<seg id="45">They move in the world of pure morality and justice.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The player's world is one of justice and total impartiality; of a perfect equality of opportunity, which is never achieved in our everyday lives.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Even advantages deriving from the direction of the wind are balanced.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The two teams change sides at the half.</seg>
		<seg id="49">When and where do we, the privileged and the underprivileged, change sides in the real world?</seg>
		<seg id="50">Players, too, are not supposed to break the rules.</seg>
		<seg id="51">If they do, they are punished and, if they relapse, excluded from play.</seg>
		<seg id="52">They are expelled from the sphere of spirituality and we see them disappearing into the chilly Hades of the locker room.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The real expulsion from Paradise comes only if the sanctity of play is profaned, if the spell is broken: by players falling out of their angelic roles and starting a fight in the field; by a cheating referee; by people realizing that a match is rigged; by spectators invading the field.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Such events do lasting damage to people and to the community.</seg>
		<seg id="55">It is a bitter shock to realize the fragility of our world of freedom, spirituality, and dignity and awaken again (as we will when the Cup winner is decided) in our less hospitable everyday world.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Egypt Needs a President, Not a Pharaoh</seg>
		<seg id="1">Egypt is undergoing a heated nationwide debate over political reform.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The central issue is a demand by all opposition parties and civil society groups to amend the 1971 constitution and abolish the 23-year-old State of Emergency that was imposed following Anwar Sadat's assassination in 1981.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Such demands are not new.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But President Hosni Mubarak and the ruling National Democratic Party have been stonewalling since the mid-1980's.</seg>
		<seg id="5">What makes the demands for reform more pressing this time are ominous developments in Egypt, the region, and in the wider world.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At home, concern about Mubarak's age (76) and deteriorating health has grown.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mubarak's ill health, widely rumored for years, was never officially acknowledged until November 2003, when it could no longer be covered up.</seg>
		<seg id="8">While speaking to Parliament, Mubarak fainted before millions of TV viewers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although he returned an hour later and delivered the rest of his speech, Egyptians began to demand greater transparency regarding the president's health as well as other state affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Meanwhile, Egypt's sagging economy, high unemployment rate, and rampant corruption have driven many Egyptian youngsters to despair.</seg>
		<seg id="11">More than one half of living Egyptians were born since Mubarak assumed office.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to a recent report by the UN Development Program, roughly half of those between 15 and 30 years old dream of emigrating to Europe, North America, or Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There are weekly reports of would-be illegal Egyptian immigrants drowning in the Mediterranean.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A few weeks ago, several youngsters suffocated to death while being deported back to Egypt across the Libyan desert in overloaded trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The incident caused an uproar that compelled the authorities to arrest, interrogate, and try the Egyptian police officers in charge.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Regional and international events have also emboldened the Egyptian opposition, not only to press for reform, but to focus on amending the constitution's articles that pertain to the presidency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mubarak has been re-elected four times, and rumors have persisted that he will either seek a fifth six-year term or establish a &quot;hereditary republic&quot; and groom his 41-year old son, Gamal, to succeed him, like Syria's Hafez al-Assad and son, Bashar.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The opposition battle cry is &quot;No&quot; to Mubarak's re-election and &quot;No&quot; to passing the presidency to Gamal.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Many Egyptians may not have major misgivings about Gamal Mubarak per se, but they find it mortifying that, after 24 years of the father, they might be stuck with another 24 or more years of the son.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The current constitution was adopted in October 1971, and has 211 articles, 30 of which concern the presidency.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The president is nominated by two-thirds of the People's Assembly, and endorsed in a plebiscite that allows only for a simple &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">A simple majority of the ballots is required to win a six-year term, which is renewable indefinitely by the same process.</seg>
		<seg id="23">These lax procedures contrast jarringly with the president's powers.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The president is the head of state and commander-in-chief; officiates over the Supreme Judiciary Council, the Supreme Police Council, and the Cabinet of Ministers; and can appoint and recall one or more vice-presidents at his sole discretion.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He also appoints the prime minister and senior ministers, and must approve all other ministers, ambassadors, and state representatives.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He can call general elections, declare war, impose a state of emergency, and issue decrees that have the force of law.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are no checks and balances on these powers.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A single article stipulates that, &quot;Accusation of the President of committing grand treason or any other criminal act may be made upon a motion submitted by at least one-third of members of the People's Assembly and approved by two-thirds.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">The president is then suspended from carrying out his duties, and the vice-president fills in until the accusation is resolved.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But Mubarak has never enacted the law essential to implementing this article or appointed a vice-president, despite repeated popular demands to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The result has been a de facto &quot;imperial presidency,&quot; with Mubarak likened to the god-king Pharaohs of ancient Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="32">No other head of state in modern times enjoys as much power.</seg>
		<seg id="33">A more apt analogy popular in Egypt compares Mubarak to Leonid Brezhnev, who for two decades presided over the Soviet Union's stagnation and decline.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Egypt's status as a regional power under Mubarak has similarly weakened steadily.</seg>
		<seg id="35">On the economic front, annual foreign investment inflows have plummeted from $3 billion in the mid-1990's to a minuscule $300 million in 2003.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Demands for reform are now focused on introducing direct presidential elections with two or more contenders, and limiting presidents to two consecutive terms in office.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It is no less important to reduce the presidency's sweeping powers and formulate viable mechanisms for enforcing the accountability of all public officials without exception.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Should Mubarak and his government fail to recommend constitutional amendments that satisfy these demands, ever more Egyptians will desert the regime and risk their lives in search of salvation in other lands.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Bush's Second Gulf Disaster</seg>
		<seg id="1">President Bush has asked that Americans not &quot;play politics&quot; at this moment of terrible national disaster.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But asking hard questions of our nation's leaders is exactly what democracy demands when the government's response to Hurricane Katrina is widely viewed as &quot;a national disgrace.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Katrina came with at least two days' warning, but authorities waited to issue an evacuation order.</seg>
		<seg id="4">There was no transportation for people without cars or money, facilities to house and care for refugees were insufficient, there were no forces in place to deliver desperately needed supplies or to secure order, and there was nowhere near the number of boats, helicopters, and other craft necessary to rescue the stranded.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Hampered by a National Guard with 40% of its people in Iraq, the pace of getting military personnel to the hardest hit areas was inordinately slow.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For four days, there was simply no clear center of command and control.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As a result, countless people suffered and died.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Much of this failure is the result of the Bush administration's policies, which effectively eroded the capacities of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the government agency primarily responsible for dealing with disasters.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Obsessed with the war on terror as well as an ideology of privatizing the functions of government, the administration systematically sapped FEMA's long-term ability to prevent disaster or at least cushion the blows when prevention is not possible.</seg>
		<seg id="10">FEMA was downsized and downgraded from a cabinet position, then placed under the Department of Homeland Security.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Its mission of disaster planning and preparation was dropped entirely, and its focus was altered to fight terrorists.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Its leadership had no experience in disaster management.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The past director was one of Bush's Texas political cronies, and the current director's qualifications include a stint as commissioner for judges and stewards with the International Arabian Horse Association, where he was asked to resign for &quot;supervision failures.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Since 2001, billions of dollars were shifted from disaster relief to homeland security and the war in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Key disaster mitigation programs were slashed and federal funding for post-disaster relief was cut in half.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The Army Corps of Engineers' budget for levee construction in New Orleans was gutted, including funds specifically aimed at the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Preventive measures to protect people and property were not carried out despite FEMA's own conclusion in 2001 that a major hurricane hitting New Orleans was one of the three &quot;likeliest, most catastrophic disasters facing this country.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">Believing FEMA to be an &quot;oversized entitlement program&quot; and that the &quot;business of government is not to provide services,&quot; Bush's first FEMA director instituted new outsourcing requirements as part of a major privatization effort.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This provoked a brain drain as experienced FEMA personnel moved into the private sector</seg>
		<seg id="20">Privatization also left poorer states and poorer communities especially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As money dried up and federal programs were contracted out to private firms at higher rates, only the richest and politically most important states and communities could compete successfully for the scarce federal grants necessary to pay for services.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For example, Florida (with 16 more electoral votes than Louisiana and where the president's brother governs) received its requested funding to protect its wetlands.</seg>
		<seg id="23">By contrast, a more needy Louisiana (with its staggering 24% poverty rate) was denied its request for flood-mitigation funds in 2004.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With Louisiana's ability to protect itself weakened and the center of disaster relief badly undermined, an inadequate government response and unnecessary destruction were almost inevitable -- with the poor paying the price.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the failure of this administration runs deeper than its chronic and intentional diversion of resources away from the types of policies that keep people safe from disaster.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Despite scientific evidence demonstrating that the increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes is related to climate change, the Bush administration systematically rejects participation in international climate-protection regimes.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Rather than continue a ban on wetlands development instituted by previous administrations, the Bush administration overturned it.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Because development-provoked erosion has brought the Gulf of Mexico 20 miles closer to land than it was in 1965, hurricanes are able to retain more strength, and their winds and waves pack more speed and destructive power.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Similarly, loss of wetlands threatened New Orleans' levees, which were built on the assumption that they would have 40 to 50 miles of protective swamp as buffer between the city and the Gulf of Mexico.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Despite every major study showing that a massive coastal restoration program and higher levees were needed to protect New Orleans, the administration permitted federal agencies to stop protecting 20 million acres of wetlands, allowed developers to drain thousands of acres and in 2004 cut funding for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80%.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New Orleans is America's canary in the mineshaft.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ideologies of privatization that incapacitate effective government, permitting the privileged to save themselves while leaving the poor clinging to roofs, must now be challenged.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This disaster is a chilling reminder of what happens when government fails to protect its citizens, and it is imperative that Americans demand accountability.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Officials who did not do their jobs must be dismissed, and elected officials whose policies aggravated the devastation wrought by Katrina must be removed from office.</seg>
		<seg id="35">We owe this to the dead and to the survivors.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Autumn of the Commandante</seg>
		<seg id="1">The death watch for Fidel Castro is something that only Gabriel Garcia Marquez could get right.</seg>
		<seg id="2">His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor, political paralysis, and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Commandante Fidel's departure from power, of course, will be solely a matter of biology, and the few pictures of him that have emerged since he took ill last year clearly show biology at work.</seg>
		<seg id="4">When the end comes, change in Cuba could be as vast as any that greeted the end of the last century's great dictators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Stalin, Franco, Tito, Mao: all were mostly alike in their means and methods.</seg>
		<seg id="6">How they passed from the scene, however, was often very different, and these differences can shape societies for years and decades to come.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Consider the Soviet Union.</seg>
		<seg id="8">On March 9, 1953, from the Gulf of Finland to the Bering Sea, everything stood still; likewise in Warsaw, Budapest, Prague, and East Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In Beijing, Mao Zedong himself bowed low before an immense effigy of Joseph Stalin.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Huge mourning crowds, crying, nearly hysterical, could be seen all over the vast empire Stalin had ruled.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Yet, within days, the word Stalinism was being expunged from a new Soviet dictionary, and three years later my grandfather, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced Stalin's &quot;cult of personality&quot; in his famous &quot;Secret Speech&quot; to the Communist Party's XXth Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Khrushchev thaw that followed may have been short-lived, but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened -- a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized upon in 1985.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The death of Marshal Josip Broz Tito brought forth an outpouring of another sort.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For decades, his personal rule imposed a false unity on Yugoslavia.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Following his death in 1980, that artificial state began to unravel, culminating in the genocidal wars in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo of the 1990's.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Not all long-term dictatorships, however, end in disintegration and mayhem.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mao's death allowed for Deng Xiaoping's return from disgrace and internal exile.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Deng quickly routed Mao's &quot;Gang of Four&quot; heirs, and in only a few years opened China's economy, fueling a capitalist revolution that has transformed China far more completely -- and successfully -- than Mao's socialist revolution ever did.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Communist Party, of course, remains in power, and Mao's portrait still looms over Tiananmen Square.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But both are mere relics of ideas and ideals that in reality have been consigned to the dustbin of history.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Spain, too, escaped violent dissolution when Generalissimo Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship collapsed at his death.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Here the old dictator can take some credit, for by re-establishing the monarchy under King Juan Carlos just before he died, Franco provided Spain with a foundation on which to build anew.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build, with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, was the modern, democratic Spain of today.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It was no accident that communist countries were (and are) usually run by geriatric leaders, and democracies by younger men and women.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That difference matters.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Old leaders can preside successfully over smoothly running countries that need no radical re-examination of their policies and purposes.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are exceptions to this rule, of course -- Churchill, Adenauer, Deng, Reagan -- but states cannot count on fortune bringing an exceptional ruler their way.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Younger leaders are more likely to be able to cope with the chop and change of difficult times.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Political competition makes it necessary for all politicians, whatever their age, to stay on their toes, anticipate new problems, and remain open to new ideas aimed at addressing them.</seg>
		<seg id="30">No one can keep himself ensconced in high office subject only to death or his own boredom.</seg>
		<seg id="31">One-party systems, one-man charismatic dictatorships, or a mixture of the two, as in Tito's Yugoslavia, are a guarantee of sclerotic minds and inert governments.</seg>
		<seg id="32">So what will become of Cuba after Fidel departs?</seg>
		<seg id="33">Many observers portray Raúl Castro, Fidel's younger brother and designated heir, as a pragmatist -- the &quot;practical Castro.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">When Cuba's lavish Soviet subsidies vanished in the early 1990's, it was Raúl who recognized that the regime's survival required economic reforms, pressing to allow private agricultural markets to reopen in order to boost food production and stave off possible starvation.</seg>
		<seg id="35">However, this is the same man who, as the head of Cuba's internal security apparatus, for many years represented the knuckles of an iron-fisted regime, directly responsible for imprisoning -- and often torturing -- thousands of dissidents.</seg>
		<seg id="36">So perhaps the best that could be hoped for is a Russian-style experiment with liberalization that is quickly called off by the regime's nervous Old Guard.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Moreover, with the support of oil-rich allies like Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez -- and with the recent discovery of significant crude reserves off Cuba's own coast -- introducing reforms could well become less urgent.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In that case, Raúl may seek to cling grimly to the fossilized system that he helped build and maintain with such brutality.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But Raúl Castro is an old man himself, so we can hope for the prospect that some Deng or, better yet, a Suarez will ultimately emerge from the wreckage of Fidelism.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But for now, younger communist officials, like Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, remain ideological hardliners whom many Cubans refer to as &quot;los Taliban.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="41">If they take control and stick to their guns, Cuba could face another long biology lesson.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Ecb Is Now Europe's Anchor</seg>
		<seg id="1">The European Central Bank is making its reputation at this time of turmoil and crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Barely a month after the rejection of the European Union Constitution in France and the Netherlands, the EU Summit in Brussels ended in a surprisingly acrimonious orgy of national egoisms and no deal. Then the terrorists struck in London.</seg>
		<seg id="3">With all this trouble, the ECB is showing itself to be an &quot;anchor of stability&quot; by steadfastly sticking to its mandate of insuring price stability. </seg>
		<seg id="4">Europe suffers from a profound crisis of confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Its economy, for example, cannot recover properly because consumers, lacking confidence in the ability of their political leaders to solve the economy's manifold economic problems (budget deficits, pensions, etc.), are saving for a rainy day they feel is just around the corner—and businessmen are reluctant to invest, because they don't trust government to make the necessary economic reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The public's lack of confidence in the EU's political leadership is totally justified.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Instead of actually doing something constructive about Europe's essential problem --reforming expensive welfare states to ensure global competitiveness--Europe's political leaders are hiding behind straw man arguments about &quot;ultra liberal Anglo Saxon models,&quot; and pressuring the ECB to lower interest rates as if European economic weakness were Frankfurt's fault.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Europe's finance ministers portray the ECB as closed to dialogue.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When testifying before the EU Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Luxembourg prime minister and Euro-group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said there should be &quot;open and frank&quot; talks between the euro-group ministers and the ECB—and French finance minister Dominique de Villepin said the same thing.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to a knowledgeable ECB source, however, Europe's finance ministers regularly meet in secret with the ECB leadership for a mutual and frank exchange of views on monetary policy and other issues.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The dialogue already exists though the public does not know it. Such disingenuousness does little to boost confidence in Europe's political leadership.  </seg>
		<seg id="12">The ECB has done all it can for growth by giving Europe a prolonged period of monetary stability at record low interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Does anyone really believe consumers are holding back on spending —and businessmen postponing their investments—in anticipation of that next drop in interest rates?</seg>
		<seg id="14">To paraphrase Keynes, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The last thing Europe needs now is an interest rate cut,&quot; says one influential member of the ECB Governing Council in a candid assessment of the current situation.  Capitulating to outside political pressure is no one's definition of an &quot;anchor of stability.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">The euro would collapse, and the ECB finished as a creditable central bank.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, ECB chief economist Otmar Issing predicts long- term interest rates would go up—not down—as inflationary expectations increased.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So cutting interest rates would not only be stupid—it would be crazy.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But the ECB is not going to cut rates even though, for public relations reasons of keeping the political wolves at bay, it deceptively hints it might.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Don't be fooled by such feints. The ECB is holding fast and, in doing so, demonstrates to Europe's peoples that there is at least one EU institution they can trust.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This is vital.</seg>
		<seg id="22">History shows political turmoil often leads to inflation, which only fuels further turmoil.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Europeans can bet their last euro the ECB will not let the fledgling common currency be ravaged by inflation because their political leaders, having failed to do their jobs, now fear they might lose them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Indeed, the courage currently demonstrated by the ECB in sticking to its guns should serve as a model for Europe's future politicians.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Once they realize they can't bully the ECB into unwanted and self-destructive interest rate cuts, EU leaders actually might summon up the will to lead—which is, after all, what they have been elected to do.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Arafat Succession Scramble</seg>
		<seg id="1">To understand what the Palestinian cause will look like without Yasir Arafat, consider the various titles that he currently holds.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Arafat is Chairman of the PLO executive Committee, President of the Palestinian National Authority, Commander-in-chief of the Palestinian forces, and head of the Fatah movement.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The PLO embodies Palestinian national aspirations for independence and statehood.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It is the highest political body for all Palestinians, both those living in Palestine and the refugees and other Palestinians in the diaspora.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Arafat's successor will need to juggle between negotiations with Israel, which will require concession on refugees' &quot;right of return&quot; to Palestine, and the aspirations of more than three million Palestinians who wish to come back to the homes from which they were expelled in the wars of 1948 and 1967.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Arafat's successor as President of the Palestinian National Authority will be bound by the Oslo Accords, which created an interim government, now headed by Prime Minister Ahmad Qurei, that is responsible for the day-to-day lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Palestinians will have to decide whether to make the position of PNA president a powerful one or merely symbolic, as it now is.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The latter option would make Qurei an empowered prime minister, which is what many Palestinians and others want.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military, security, and intelligence units under one leader, who is expected to ensure the rule of law.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But these forces are now in disarray, with most uniformed Palestinian security agencies needing to be reorganized after four years of intensive effort by Israel to crush them.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The key factor in internal security is local paramilitary units.</seg>
		<seg id="12">These units, most of which are not controlled by the PNA's central leadership, are more loyal to grassroots figures than to uniformed PNA officers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Local Fatah leaders like Marwan Barghouti have tremendous power over the nationalist armed units that are loosely organized under the title of the Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Barghouti advocated and was trying to implement internal Fatah elections when the Israelis arrested him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As a street leader who was elected as the head of the Bir Zeit University student council, he gained legitimacy by being chosen by his peers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">When the Oslo process began, he refused to accept any official position within the Palestinian Authority, choosing instead to remain close to the local Fatah cadres.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Whoever fills Arafat's shoes will need to make sure that these brigades are satisfied that their status, demands, and leaders are respected.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Indeed, the power struggle that will ensue in the post-Arafat era will ultimately center on Al Fatah, the backbone of the PLO.</seg>
		<seg id="19">A worldwide assembly chooses Fatah's 100-member revolutionary council, which in turn elects a 20-member central committee, where most of the power struggle will take place.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Many young street leaders will insist on an emergency meeting of the revolutionary council, or even holding the sixth general assembly (which would be the first since 1988).</seg>
		<seg id="21">Events in recent months show that the Al Asqa Martyrs' Brigades have forced even Arafat to take their demands into consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While much of the power struggle will take place within the nationalist camp, one must not overlook the Islamist camp led by Hamas and Islamic Jihad.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although the Islamists are unlikely to interfere in the post-Arafat power struggle, they will not sit idly by if the new leadership moves in what they consider the wrong direction.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Of course, the new leadership will have to reach some agreement with the Islamists regarding the rules of the game, both domestically and vis-à-vis Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Without such an agreement, and if the new leadership cracks down hard on the Islamists, a violent civil war could erupt.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Most importantly, in order to consolidate his leadership, the next Palestinian leader must make some hard decisions and show some tangible results quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The experience of the first Palestinian prime minister, who resigned largely because of his inability to deliver any improvements to his people -- particularly personal and collective security, the rule of law, and an end to chaos in Palestinian areas -- remains fresh in the public's memory.</seg>
		<seg id="28">At the same time, a freeze on settlement activities, release of Palestinian political prisoners -- including Marwan Barghouti -- and the removal of the hundreds of checkpoints between Palestinian cities would revive a feeling of hope, without which no Palestinian leader can negotiate what the world wants: a peace settlement.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The problem is that no Palestinian leader, no matter who he is, can deliver these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="30">They represent a direct challenge to the Israeli occupiers, neighboring Arab countries, and the international community, led by the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Moscow Mystery of 2008</seg>
		<seg id="1">Usually at this time of year, people are obsessed with what the coming year will bring.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in Russia, the real uncertainty concerns 2008, not 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Indeed, one can boil Russian politics down to one issue nowadays: Will President Vladimir Putin stay on as president after 2008, despite repeatedly stating that he won't?</seg>
		<seg id="4">And if he indeed steps down, whom will he groom as his replacement?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Will his chosen successor belong to one of the Kremlin's feuding factions?</seg>
		<seg id="6">Or will he pick an &quot;outsider&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Unless Putin maintains his stature as the country's ultimate arbiter and decision-taker, there is a high risk of fierce infighting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an environment where power and property are inseparable and all government institutions are emasculated, a major transfer of authority at the top may lead to violent redistribution.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thus, resolving these questions is vital for Russia's political elites who are anxious to preserve the current perks and gain more.</seg>
		<seg id="10">As for the public, the vast majority appears resigned to accepting whatever is arranged by the leadership.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Fully 45% of Russians believe that Putin will name a successor, and that this person will become the new president.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Almost a quarter believe that the constitution will be changed so that Putin can have a third term.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Either way, it is almost universally understood that the transfer of presidential authority is masterminded at the top and endorsed at the ballot box.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The balance of forces in the legislature, too, will be determined by the Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Over the past years the configuration of the political parties and the election legislation have been repeatedly modified so as to suit the interests of the ruling elite.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As a result unwanted forces have no chance in next December's parliamentary election.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Alienated from politics, ordinary Russians are indifferent to everything that does not immediately affect them, and do not seek to hold anyone accountable.</seg>
		<seg id="18">They were not bothered by the journalist Anna Politkovskaya's recent murder or the assassination of Andrey Kozlov, first deputy chairman of the central bank, or the implications of Alexander Litvinenko's poisoning (a majority in a recent poll said he was killed by his &quot;business partners&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="19">The alienation between the state and the people has a long tradition in Russia, and so does public apathy.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But these days the apathy is reinforced by improved living standards.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Thanks to windfall revenues from oil and gas, Russians live better than ever in the postcommunist times.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Moreover, it may be argued that never in Russian history has the proportion of those who enjoy reasonably decent lifestyles been as high as it is today.</seg>
		<seg id="23">As a result, people have become even more compliant in the face of increasingly autocratic governance.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Of course, there are plenty of reasons to complain, and people may grumble, but they won't come together to oppose the status quo.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Marginal political groups and figures who stage protests increasingly find themselves confronting official pressure and even harassment -- all the more reason for the broad public to turn away from them.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Since the election results are preordained, many may simply not vote.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, today's Russian state barely has a reason to muster active support.</seg>
		<seg id="28">On the contrary, public participation is seen as an obstacle to the goals pursued by the bureaucracy: self-perpetuation and expanding control over lucrative assets.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If any among the Russian elite ever nursed modernizing ambitions, they have abandoned them, for without public participation, modernization is a fallacy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Instead, the Kremlin increasingly draws on the conservative, Soviet-style electorate as its power base, while alienating the advanced, the entrepreneurial, and the best educated.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Stephen Jennings, the chairman of the board of Renaissance Capital, an investment group with a decade of experience in Russia, recently noted the country's &quot;contradictory trends&quot;: the emergence of a &quot;burgeoning middle class&quot; alongside a &quot;highly centralized government, breeding a new class of state oligarchs and a mushrooming bureaucracy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="32">The problem is that Russia's best and brightest, which Jennings praised for &quot;high management skills, professionalism, productivity, and social and economic ambition,&quot; don't seem to mind their alienation from policy-making.</seg>
		<seg id="33">They may resent the Kremlin's economic policies, but they put up with Russia's rampant corruption and its disgraceful ratings in competitiveness indices, just as they put up with the general erosion of democracy, manipulation of the judiciary, and weak law enforcement.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Like their less advanced compatriots, they don't seek to hold the government accountable or call for change.</seg>
		<seg id="35">For the time being, life is good enough as it is.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Thus, if there is any threat to a smooth transition in 2008, or a risk of subsequent destabilization, it may stem from infighting at the top, not from the public.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Optimists hope that at some point Russia's burgeoning middle class will assume responsibility for Russia's future and demand a radical improvement in governance.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But what would trigger a shift from passive compliance to active public participation?</seg>
		<seg id="39">If good times breed political apathy, and bad policies lead to a socioeconomic decline, Russia's best and brightest may find themselves outstripped by populist forces.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Anti-Drug God that Failed</seg>
		<seg id="1">Russians and Ukrainians are once again being made victims of a utopian dream.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Since the end of communism in 1991, these countries (and others) have experienced a dramatic increase in the use of illicit drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">They have responded with draconian policies that mirror the simplistic message of a drug-free society espoused by UN drug treaties and the institutions that seek to enforce them.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Today, these policies are contributing to an explosion of HIV infections in much of the developing world.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The UN treaties that guide global drug policy reflect none of the recent findings on drug use and addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Indeed, most UN drug conventions were enacted long before the appearance of HIV/AIDS--a disease fuelled by injection drug use in the former Soviet Union and many parts of Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Consider Russia and Ukraine, which have the world's fastest-growing rate of HIV infection.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The number of people infected with HIV in Russia and Ukraine has increased by more than 18 times over the past five years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As many as 1.5 million Russians and 400,000 Ukrainians are estimated to have HIV; at least 85% of known infections are attributed to intravenous drug use.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Governments in Russia and Ukraine allocate the bulk of their drug-related resources to law enforcement in a misguided attempt to comply with the UN drug treaties.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Individual users suffer police abuse and are driven away from vital health and treatment services.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Meanwhile, the flow of drugs continues undiminished.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Repressive policies have never succeeded in eliminating demand for drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="14">They do not tackle any of the economic, social, or health factors associated with the use of illicit drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Locking up drug users is not a solution--in Russia, it is easier to score drugs in prison than outside.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Moreover, in a repressive climate, drug users who avoid arrest are more likely to face increased discrimination, reducing their motivation to take measures to protect their own health and the health of those around them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In such circumstances--without hope for a better future or the opportunity for compassion-based interaction with society--drug use and HIV spread rapidly.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Russia and Ukraine are not alone in facing these twin epidemics.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Pakistan, Iran, China, the Central Asian countries, and other places with rising rates of intravenous drug use are bound for the same public health catastrophe if they pursue similar discredited policies.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Public health intervention to reduce the damage caused by drugs has been proven--by decades of research in dozens of countries--to be vastly more effective at lowering HIV infection rates and healthcare costs.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Using a conservative model, the British medical journal Lancet estimated that the US would have recorded net savings of $500 million if it had implemented a national syringe exchange program between 1987-1995.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Similarly, an international survey found that HIV infection among intravenous drug users decreased by 5.8% per year in cities with syringe exchange programs, and increased by 5.9% per year in cities without such programs.</seg>
		<seg id="23">No major study has shown that syringe exchange programs increase rates of drug use.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Indeed, studies in the US, Australia, and elsewhere show that drug treatment rates tend to remain steady or rise, because syringe exchange participants gain greater access to rehabilitative care.</seg>
		<seg id="25">UN agencies such as the Commission on Narcotic Drugs or the Office on Drugs and Crime are not mandated to prescribe specific drug strategies.</seg>
		<seg id="26">However, their narrowly focused anti-drug stance strongly influences the policies and practices of member nations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Many individual governments, obsessed with compliance, are unable or unwilling to consider the negative public health effects of harsh anti-drug policies.</seg>
		<seg id="28">International institutions chose to look the other way in the 1990's as HIV/AIDS killed millions in Africa, infecting more than 25% of the population in some countries.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Because of similar ignorance, this terrible epidemic now looms over the former Soviet Union and other regions.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Have we really learned nothing?</seg>
		<seg id="31">It is not too late for international and national policymakers to reconsider their strategies.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In defiance of the UN conventions, some countries have adopted more pragmatic approaches to dealing with drug use and HIV.</seg>
		<seg id="33">By treating drug use first and foremost as a problem of public health, nations can fight the spread of HIV far more effectively.</seg>
		<seg id="34">To achieve this, they should take the following steps:</seg>
		<seg id="35">· Adopt anti-discrimination and equal-protection laws to guarantee the civil liberties and human rights of drug users and people living with HIV;</seg>
		<seg id="36">· Acknowledge drug use as a public health issue, not a law-and-order issue, with government policies reflecting this reality;</seg>
		<seg id="37">· Explicitly legalize needle exchange and the use of methadone and other &quot;substitute&quot; medications for treatment;</seg>
		<seg id="38">· Create national programs that encompass a full range of pragmatic, inclusive, and accessible harm reduction services, from education and drug treatment to substitution therapy and needle exchange;</seg>
		<seg id="39">· Include drug users and their advocates in developing policies on drug use at both international and national levels.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Continuing resistance to calls to restructure anti-drug strategies and goals will only worsen the HIV epidemic and contribute to the deaths of millions of vulnerable people.</seg>

		<seg id="4">All of these are worthy goals, to be sure, but they belong intrinsically to the sphere of national political decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Indeed, under the European Treaties, the Union has no competence to enact legislation and policy in these domains, nor powers to enforce them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But the European Council, spurred by the European Commission, invented a new policy approach - called &quot;open coordination&quot; - in order to impinge on these fields.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Open coordination entails the definition of common goals at the EU level, voluntary compliance by the member states, and peer review of results within the European Council.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Inevitably, open coordination has failed to deliver on its promises.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Moreover, the delusion that the European Council can somehow call growth and productivity into being has provided a diversion to national politicians who are unwilling to push for unpopular decisions back home.</seg>
		<seg id="10">My first suggestion to Barroso, therefore, is to scrap the Lisbon agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Only this will make it clear that responsibility for national economic performance lies with national policy-makers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This brings me to the subject of macroeconomic coordination at the EU level.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Maastricht Treaty envisaged a simple policy framework for economic and monetary union.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Monetary policy was centralized and entrusted to an independent central bank, while fiscal policy was left to the member states.</seg>
		<seg id="15">National governments were made subject - under the excessive-deficit procedure - to the twin constraints that fiscal deficits should not exceed 3% of GDP and government debt should remain below 60% of GDP (or at least tend towards that value).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Later on, the Stability and Growth Pact added a requirement that, over the medium term, government accounts should be &quot;close to balance.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Essentially, this aimed to prevent irresponsible budgetary policies after the euro's launch, while leaving sufficient room for cyclical oscillations of the deficit within the 3% limit.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The credibility of this apparatus was badly damaged by the November 2003 public controversy between the Commission and the Ecofin Council over the application of the excessive-deficit procedure to France and Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This does not mean that it should be abandoned.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On the contrary, a common external constraint on fiscal behavior is needed as a joint safeguard against an unsustainable accumulation of public debt that could affect financial stability and inflation throughout the EU - a risk aggravated by the impact of aging populations on pension systems.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Such a constraint also provides a welcome anchor for domestic decision-making in member states with weaker political systems.</seg>
		<seg id="22">But the system needs to be reviewed.</seg>
		<seg id="23">I would not listen to those who advocate excluding investment from fiscal deficits: this would only offer new incentives for creative accounting and unsustainable accumulation of debt.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Instead, the emphasis should shift from annual deficits to debt sustainability.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The debt criterion, for example, could be supplemented by a limit on the (trend) growth rate of public spending, which would be kept below that of nominal GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The Commission's powers to initiate action when there is a risk of excessive deficits should be strengthened - provided, of course, that the Commission never again forgets that surveillance of national policies is a task that requires political judgment and cannot be left to accountants and lawyers.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Finally, top priority should be assigned to completing the Single European Market, in which the Union has powerful legal instruments to pry open markets and sustain competition.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The best therapy for reinvigorating growth is both direct, by increasing competitive pressure, and indirect, by triggering the necessary adaptation in national employment, welfare, and education policies.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The job is far from finished.</seg>
		<seg id="30">State aid to ailing companies remains ubiquitous, and common rules designed to ensure free circulation of goods and services are not fully respected by the member states - public procurement and energy markets being prime examples.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Moreover, most markets for services - securities trading, wholesale and retail distribution, business services, and local utilities - remain sheltered from competition and free circulation rules.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Empirical evidence indicates that these distortions in the market for services, which account for about two thirds of GDP, underlie most of the EU's productivity gap with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In recent years the European Council has not devoted sufficient attention to these tasks, which require full and continuing commitment by member states to transpose and implement Community directives.</seg>
		<seg id="34">All too often, the Commission has favored enacting new legislation and creating new spending programs over the effective administration of what already exists.</seg>
		<seg id="35">So Barroso should forget the high-flying platitudes of the Lisbon agenda and focus instead on effective completion of the Single Market and keeping the member states' fiscal policies in order.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Let national governments take responsibility for their countries' economic performance.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Emotional Clash of Civilizations</seg>
		<seg id="1">Throughout the so-called &quot;war on terror,&quot; the notion of a &quot;clash of civilization&quot; between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Instead, the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict &quot;within&quot; a particular civilization, namely Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious, and easily summarized: democratization.</seg>
		<seg id="4">If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the &quot;Greater Middle-East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of the United States, as the most powerful and moral nation, to bring about that necessary change.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The status quo was untenable.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Implementing democracy, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Today, Iraq may be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.</seg>
		<seg id="10">All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Rather than a &quot;clash of civilizations,&quot; we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There is a clash within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries, risks causing regional destabilization.</seg>
		<seg id="14">There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West, but between the secularized world and a growing religious one.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At an even deeper and atavistic level, there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It would be a gross oversimplification to speak, as some are doing, of a clash between civilization and barbarism.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In reality, we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion, which runs between the West (with the US being a complicated exception) and much of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), but particularly the Islamic world.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The divide reflects how religion defines an individual's identity within a society.</seg>
		<seg id="19">At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples' daily lives.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In some ways, &quot;they&quot; are our own buried past and, with a combination of ignorance, prejudice, and, above all, fear, &quot;we&quot; are afraid that &quot;they&quot; could define our future.</seg>
		<seg id="21">We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.</seg>
		<seg id="22">They have tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, from communism to capitalism.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Since everything has failed, why not give God a chance?</seg>
		<seg id="24">Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts, but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege -- and, paradoxically, the virtue -- of ignorance.</seg>
		<seg id="26">We all see how others feel and react, but without the minimal historical and cultural tools necessary to decipher those reactions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions -- and of ignorance.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This clash of emotions is exacerbated in the case of Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.</seg>
		<seg id="30">From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It has become an obsession.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians.</seg>
		<seg id="33">On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), Israel's strength and resilience is a direct consequence of their own weakness, divisions, and corruption.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda, but they do not oppose it with all their heart.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Here, perhaps, is the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim, particularly Arab, culture of humiliation.</seg>
		<seg id="39">It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But that will be difficult, for transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the &quot;other&quot; that neither side may yet be ready to undertake.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Globalization and Anti-Americanism</seg>
		<seg id="1">Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">American Democrats say that President Bush's policies have squandered America's attractiveness.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Republicans reply that America is bound to be resented because of its size and its association with globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Anti-Americanism, they say, will persist because some people see America as a cultural threat.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I believe that such views lack historical perspective.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Contrary to conventional wisdom, globalization is not homogenizing and Americanizing the cultures of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Although the United States is at the forefront of the current information revolution, which is creating many similarities in social and cultural habits (such as television viewing or Internet use) that are attributed to Americanization, correlation is not causation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">To see why, imagine a country that introduced computers and communications at a rapid rate in a world in which America did not exist.</seg>
		<seg id="9">You would still expect major social and cultural changes from such modernization.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Of course, because the US exists and is at the forefront of the information revolution, there is a degree of Americanization, but that is likely to diminish over the course of the twenty-first century as technology spreads and local cultures modernize in their own ways.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan, a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the middle of the nineteenth century, Japan became the first Asian country to embrace globalization, and to borrow successfully from the world without losing its uniqueness.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During the Meiji Restoration, Japan searched broadly for tools and innovations that would allow it to become a major power rather than a victim of Western imperialism.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It sent young people to the West for education.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Its delegations scoured the world for ideas in science, technology, and industry.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the political realm, Meiji reformers were well aware of Anglo-American ideas and institutions, but deliberately turned to German models because they were deemed more suitable to a country with an emperor.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The lesson that Japan teaches the rest of the world is not simply that an Asian country can compete, but that after a century and a half of globalization, it is possible to adapt while preserving a unique culture.</seg>
		<seg id="18">More fundamentally, the image of a homogenizing America reflects a mistakenly static view of culture.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Efforts to portray local cultures as unchanging often reflect reactionary political strategies rather than descriptions of reality.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa has put it, those who argue in favor of cultural identity and against globalization, betray a stagnant attitude towards culture that is not borne out by historical fact.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Do we know of any cultures that have remained unchanged through time?</seg>
		<seg id="22">To find any of them one has to travel to the small, primitive, magico-religious communities made up of people… who due to their primitive condition, become progressively more vulnerable to exploitation and extermination.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For example, many more countries turned to Canada than to America as an example for framing constitutions in the aftermath of the Cold War.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Globalization is also a two-edged sword.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In some areas, there is not only a backlash against American cultural imports, but an effort to change American culture itself.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Capital punishment may now be supported by a majority of Americans, but the death penalty is regarded as an egregious violation of human rights across Europe - indeed, across much of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="28">American environmental attitudes toward climate change or genetic modification of food bring similar criticism.</seg>
		<seg id="29">More subtly, America's openness to immigration both enriches and changes American culture.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Finally, globalization and the information revolution may reinforce rather than reduce cultural diversity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Some French commentators express fear that in a world of Internet global marketing, there will no longer be room for a culture that cherishes hundreds of different types of cheese.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But on the contrary, the Internet allows dispersed customers to come together in a way that encourages niche markets, including hundreds of Web sites dedicated only to cheese.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The use of the Welsh language in Britain and Gaelic in Ireland is greater today than fifty years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Britain, Belgium, and Spain, among others in Europe, have devolved more power to local regions.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The global information age may strengthen rather than weaken local cultures.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Economic and social globalization does produce superficial similarities in T-shirt logos and soft drink brands, but an underlying cultural diversity will remain.</seg>
		<seg id="38">American culture is now prominent, and it contributes to America's attractiveness - its &quot;soft power&quot; - in many, but not all, areas.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the same time, immigrants, ideas, and events outside America's borders are changing American culture within the borders of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="40">As globalization spreads technical capabilities, and information technology allows broader participation in global communications, American economic and cultural preponderance may diminish.</seg>
		<seg id="41">A little less dominance may mean a little less anxiety about Americanization, fewer complaints about American arrogance, and less intensity in the anti-American backlash.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The US may have less control in the future, but it may find itself living in a world somewhat more congenial to its basic values of democracy, free markets, individual liberties, and human rights.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Why America Must Rejoin the World</seg>
		<seg id="1">The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of September 11, 2001, profoundly changed the US, spawning a new focus on foreign policy.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Bush administration's new national security strategy, issued in September 2002, identifies the combination of terrorism, rogue states, and weapons of mass destruction as the primary threat confronting America.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Most people agree with the new focus of American foreign policy, but debate the means by which it is carried out.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Is the threat so great that America must act alone, or should the US act only with the support of international institutions, even if that holds the country back?</seg>
		<seg id="5">Events in Iraq illustrate this debate, but it has deeper roots.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In his 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush said about America, &quot;If we are an arrogant nation, they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation, they'll respect us.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">He was right, but unfortunately many of America's friends saw the first eight months of his administration as arrogantly concerned with narrow American interests, focused on military power, and dismissive of treaties, norms, and multilateralism.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The administration's peremptory announcement that the Kyoto Protocol on global climate change was &quot;dead&quot; contributed to a reaction from other countries that cost the US its seat on the UN Human Rights Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="9">September 11 supposedly changed all that.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Congress finally paid to the United Nations America's debts, and the president has focused its efforts on a coalition against terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But quick success of war in Afghanistan has led administration members and commentators to conclude the proper functioning of unilateralism. The columnist Charles Krauthammer, for example, advocates a &quot;new unilateralism&quot; in which America refuses to play the role of &quot;international docile citizen&quot; and went his own unscrupulous aims.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The new unilateralists make a mistake in focusing too heavily on military power alone.</seg>
		<seg id="13">True, America's military power--backed up by a budget equivalent to the next eight countries combined -is essential to global stability, and an essential part of the response to terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But the metaphor of war should not blind us to the fact that suppressing terrorism will take years of patient, unspectacular civilian cooperation with other countries in areas such as intelligence sharing, police work, tracing financial flows, and cooperation among customs officials.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Military success in Afghanistan addressed the easiest part of the problem.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Al Qaeda retains cells in some fifty countries.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Rather than proving the unilateralists' point, the partial nature of the success in Afghanistan illustrates the continuing need for cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Similarly, it was much easier to win the war in Iraq than to win the peace.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The problem for Americans in the 21</seg>
		<seg id="20">The US lacks both the international and domestic prerequisites to resolve conflicts internal to other societies, and to monitor and control transnational transactions that threaten Americans at home.</seg>
		<seg id="21">On many of today's key issues, such as international financial stability, drug smuggling, the spread of diseases, or global climate change, military power is ineffective.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Indeed, its use can be counterproductive.</seg>
		<seg id="23">America must instead mobilize international coalitions to address these shared threats and challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The willingness of others to cooperate depends in part on their own self-interest, but also on the attractiveness of American positions.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That power to attract is what I call &quot;soft power.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">It means that others want what you want, and there is less need to use carrots and sticks to make others do what you want.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Hard power grows out of a country's military and economic might.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, ideals, and policies.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Hard power will always remain vital, but soft power will become increasingly important in dealing with transnational issues whose resolution requires multilateral cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To be sure, no large country can afford to be purely multilateralist, and sometimes the US must take the lead, as it did in Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But in Iraq, President Bush should have followed his father's example and built a broad international coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Now, as his administration returns to the UN to seek a new resolution that will enable other countries to contribute troops and resources for peacekeeping and reconstruction in Iraq, he is paying the price for the way he went to war.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Granted, multilateralism can be used by smaller states to restrict American freedom of action, but this does not mean that it is not generally in American interests.</seg>
		<seg id="34">By embedding US policies in multilateral frameworks, America can make its disproportionate power more legitimate and acceptable.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Even well intentioned Americans are not immune to Lord Acton's famous warning that power tends to corrupt.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Learning to listen to others and to define US interests broadly to include global interests will be crucial to American soft power and whether others see the American preponderance as benign or not.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The paradox of American power is that the largest power since Rome cannot achieve many of its objectives unilaterally in a global information age.</seg>
		<seg id="38">America needs to pay more attention to soft power and to multilateral cooperation.</seg>
		<seg id="39">That is the real lesson of September 11.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Socialism or Global Division?</seg>
		<seg id="1">For the first time in history, we have the knowledge, the technology, and the wealth to design a different world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">We have the resources to &quot;make poverty history.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">But, though we have the power to change the world, we are not taking the steps needed to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In 2000, the world's governments adopted the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which aim to halve global poverty by 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Yet the international community has lacked the political will needed to meet these basic responsibilities to humanity, causing people to lose faith in politics.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Unless we take action, our citizens will lose hope in the power of democracy -- or find hope in extremism, fundamentalism, and violence.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To restore people's trust not only in politics, but also in their own potential, our policies must guarantee responsible governance and institutions that work for and with responsible citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As the largest political organization in the world, the Socialist International can unite the world's citizens around a new global agenda to achieve these goals.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Our first challenge is to democratize globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="10">We must reconfigure globalization from the bottom-up, bringing in the two-thirds of the human race that is currently excluded from the process, on terms that reflect the socialist principles of inclusion, cultural diversity, and sustainable development.</seg>
		<seg id="11">How can citizens have a democratic say in world economic development when the IMF and World Bank work on the principle of &quot;one dollar, one vote&quot;?</seg>
		<seg id="12">There can be no real democracy when we have a massive concentration of capital and power in the hands of the few; when multinational corporations challenge the power of democratically elected representatives; when organized criminals can buy off police officers, judges, and politicians; when monopolization of the media erodes fundamental freedoms.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Democratizing globalization will take time.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But we can accelerate the process by strengthening regional cooperation and integration.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This calls for new channels of cooperation with progressive forces in other parts of the world -- in China, the United States, India, and the Arab world.</seg>
		<seg id="16">To tackle global problems, we need to strengthen and democratize international institutions like the United Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we need to look beyond reform of the Security Council and start creating a democratic global architecture that puts globalization at the service of citizens, not markets.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Today, the top priority for socialists is to re-establish a balance between economic productivity and social justice.</seg>
		<seg id="19">While we have some successful precedents, such as the Nordic model, it is difficult for nations to achieve this balance.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As capitalist markets give way to vast commercial networks, and as market economies become market societies, governments and unions are increasingly restricted in scope.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This has disempowered and divided our citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Citizens of developed countries increasingly feel like mere objects of consumerism, while citizens of developing countries struggle for daily survival.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In both cases, but in different ways, people feel impoverished.</seg>
		<seg id="24">To be sure, we have very diverse societies, but we also face new forms of inequality.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Lack of labor standards in one part of the world undermines the social welfare of workers in other parts of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mass migration from poor countries has created fear and xenophobia in richer countries, especially among the working class.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Similarly, free trade has turned farmers and service workers in the developing and developed world against each other.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Environmental concerns have become a &quot;blame game.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">The developed world fears the depletion of vital resources by the developing world, which in turn blames the developed world for destroying the environment in pursuit of profit.</seg>
		<seg id="30">To bridge these divides, we must rethink the nature of employment in an increasingly automated, borderless, and mobile global economy.</seg>
		<seg id="31">As capital is globalized, so basic labor standards should be global.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Forced labor, child labor, and discrimination in the workplace must be eliminated.</seg>
		<seg id="33">We must also make our own politics more democratic.</seg>
		<seg id="34">We must fight exclusion from our political parties, just as we fight exclusion in our societies.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This means welcoming migrants and minorities, creating more opportunities for women and the disabled, and empowering citizens through education and participation.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In PASOK, the Greek Socialist party that I lead, we are undertaking far-reaching reforms in this direction.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Likewise, the goal of the Socialist International is a world governed not by free markets, but by free people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;India everywhere&quot; was the theme at this year's World Economic Forum.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In the West, there is so much focus on China that India's achievements are often acknowledged only as an afterthought.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As if to underscore the point that political stability must triumph in the long run, the Indians plastered Swiss buses with the banner: &quot;India: The World's Fastest Growing Democracy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">The India media blitz was a huge success.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In Davos, speaker after speaker touted the idea that even if China is ahead now, over the longer run, the race between Asia's two giants is a toss-up.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For a few days at least, India's emergence as a superpower on par with China was taken as a fait accompli.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But what is the reality in the race between economies with more than a billion people each?</seg>
		<seg id="8">On the surface, China has opened up quite a lead on India.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Twenty-five years ago, at the start of the contemporary wave of globalization, national output in India and China was about the same.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Now, by any measure, China is more than twice as rich.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the real difference is not so much that successful Chinese are doing better than successful Indians.</seg>
		<seg id="12">After all, the Indian elite are world-beaters, as Lakshmi Mittal's bold $22 billion bid for French steelmaker Arcelor shows.</seg>
		<seg id="13">No, the real difference -- whether we like to admit it or not -- is that China's communist government has succeeded in globalizing a much larger share of its population than India's democratic government has managed to do.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Not that China is exactly egalitarian.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is only along the coast, home to roughly one in three Chinese citizens, that most people can be said to have really joined the twenty-first century.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Much of rural China is still miserable, with 150 million people effectively unemployed and health and education standards often befitting an earlier century.</seg>

		<seg id="18">Perhaps only one in five persons are integrated into the global economy.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For every call center employee, there are many more people still eking out a subsistence living on the land.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Whereas China probably has about 450 million people in its globalized economy, India has at most 200-250 million.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is this difference, more than anything else, that sets the two economies apart.</seg>
		<seg id="22">What can India do to close the gap?</seg>
		<seg id="23">Its biggest shortcoming is its lack of roads, bridges, ports, and other infrastructure, where the contrast with China is just stunning.</seg>
		<seg id="24">If your products can't get to the global economy, you cannot conquer it.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Over the past five years, China has multiplied its highway system five-fold.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Its 50,000 kilometers of new roads are built to handle even large aircraft, which is more than one can say about some of the runways at India's shambolic airports.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It is not just a matter of money -- India's central bank is rolling in cash, which it has mainly invested in low-yield foreign treasury bills.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The real problem is that China's authoritarian system faces little opposition when it decides to bulldoze a shantytown that stands in the way of a new airport.</seg>
		<seg id="29">India's government, by contrast, has neither the power nor the inclination to trample over poor people to make rich people richer.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Unfortunately, without infrastructure, the 800 million-plus Indians who have not yet &quot;made it&quot; don't have a chance.</seg>
		<seg id="31">India will never be able to create enough jobs in services alone; it must be able to compete in low-end manufacturing areas as well.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Without better infrastructure, the majority of India's citizens will remain frozen out of globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="33">So, is the idea that India's economy could overtake China's hopeless romanticism?</seg>
		<seg id="34">Not necessarily, if only because the areas where India excels, notably services, have far higher potential margins than manufacturing.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here, the Chinese, hampered by a vastly inferior legal system, will not be able to compete easily.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Western companies are far more inclined to trust Indian firms with sensitive financial information or patents than they are in the case of China.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Foreign companies know that if they outsource any high-tech process to China, they might as well publish their blueprints on the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="38">India also has a much better developed financial system than China, an advantage that will be increasingly important as the two countries develop.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Command and control financing (&quot;directed lending,&quot; as economists call it) works well when it comes to building bridges; it is a lot less effective when it comes to choosing what companies deserve to survive.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The challenge for the Indians, and, indeed, for other emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico, is that they need to find ways to broaden the successful sectors of their economies without strangling them.</seg>
		<seg id="41">If India is to ever catch up with China, it must globalize more of its citizens, through better provision of health, education and infrastructure.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Only then will we truly start seeing &quot;India everywhere.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Russia's Skeptical G8 Partners</seg>
		<seg id="1">Poor oil-rich Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is trying so hard to have its turn as chair of the elite Group of Eight countries taken seriously.</seg>
		<seg id="3">President Vladimir Putin, perhaps hoping to elevate the presidential summit talks in St. Petersburg in July, has laid out an ambitious agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He plans to lead his colleagues in erudite conversations about education, infectious diseases, and -- to make sure that no one dozes off -- &quot;energy security.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">And what has Putin gotten for his efforts?</seg>
		<seg id="6">Not much.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Bush administration, led by Vice President Dick Cheney (but with his boss's explicit approval), recently accused Russia of backsliding into its old &quot;evil empire&quot; ways.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Putin shot back, portraying the United States as &quot;Comrade Wolf,&quot; ready to pounce on any nation that leaves itself vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Suspense seems to be building around how Bush and Putin will greet each other when they meet in St. Petersburg.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Europeans, for their part, are still hysterical about getting caught up in the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute that left their pipelines dry for a few days at the beginning of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They see discussing &quot;energy security&quot; with Russia as akin to chatting about water safety with Comrade Crocodile.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Of course, people who really want to be unkind will point out the absurdity of Russia's membership in a club that includes the giant economies of US, Germany, Japan, England, France, Italy, and (less so) Canada.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Why wasn't Chinese president Hu Jintao, whose country's economy is the world's second largest (when measured at world prices), given a seat at the table instead of Putin?</seg>
		<seg id="14">After all, even with all its energy resources, and even with today's sky-high oil and gas prices, Russia's national income is only about the size of Greater Los Angeles.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Perhaps what Putin needs to do is stop suffering all the criticisms and go on the offensive.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He could start by pointing out to his smugly democratic counterparts that he is probably more popular in Russia today than any of them are in their own countries.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He might actually win a fair election tomorrow (not that he would ever risk finding out).</seg>
		<seg id="18">Few of the others could make the same claim with a straight face.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Of course, Putin's success over the past few years in killing off any semblance of a free press -- and when an ex-KGB man &quot;kills off&quot; a free press, it is not just a figure of speech -- has helped mute open opposition.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Even so, Putin does seem genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader who can anchor their country without sinking it.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Putin might also argue that Russia's fiscal position is far stronger that of the other G8 members.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Yes, it helps that Siberia turned out to be a giant oil well, with the government sucking up much of the money.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is balancing his country's books, too, for now.</seg>
		<seg id="24">But, to be fair, oil is not the whole story.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Most economists advocate rich countries' replacing their complex and antiquated tax codes with a simple low flat tax, and they bemoan the fact that so few countries have tried it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Putin, however, implemented such a policy a few years ago, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Of course, the other G8 leaders might be less enamored of some of Russia's other approaches to addressing budget problems.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Most G8 countries seem incapable of achieving the political consensus required to take necessary steps such as raising the retirement age or significantly cutting the indexation of benefits to inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Russia, by contrast, has essentially abandoned its pensioners by inflating away the value of their incomes.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Indeed, many of the elderly in rural Russia are forced to sustain themselves by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to till.</seg>
		<seg id="31">That is, assuming they survive at all: since the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russian male life expectancy has plummeted from 65 years to around 60 years.</seg>
		<seg id="32">There is growing evidence that the stress of transition is the leading cause of death, even above big killers in postcommunist Russia such as alcohol, murder, and AIDS.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Should Putin tell his colleagues that they, too, could balance their countries' intergenerational accounts by starving the elderly?</seg>
		<seg id="34">So perhaps Putin had better not try to push his country's accomplishments too far.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Maybe the best plan is simply to let the vodka flow and hope for a round of smiles in the photo ops.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In any case, when Putin tells his guests how they can pay Russia more to improve their own &quot;energy security,&quot; he may finally get the respect that he craves.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Economy of Fear</seg>
		<seg id="38">The global economy seems to be walking on water, shrugging off soaring oil prices, policy paralysis in Europe, unsustainable borrowing by the United States, and record housing prices.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Is it because, as G-8 leaders would have us believe, investors are in a buoyant mood, confident in their leaders' stewardship of the global economy?</seg>
		<seg id="40">Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear, fed by events such as the recent London bombings, that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems?</seg>
		<seg id="41">The role of phenomenally low long-term (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries, and, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Europe has benefited less, but its economies would be a lot worse off if long-term interest rates climbed back to their 25-year average.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Similarly, Latin America has been booming in recent years, despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Low long-term interest rates have kept the region's debts manageable, while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region's commodity exports.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Why hasn't the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees, as it has on so many other occasions?</seg>
		<seg id="47">Again, the answer is low interest rates.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Ordinarily, a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations, followed by rising interest rates at all maturities.</seg>
		<seg id="49">But this time, even as the US Federal Reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to keep inflation in line, long-term interest rates -- which are far more important -- have been magically declining.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Indeed, America has been the single biggest beneficiary of this freakish low-interest-rate environment, with everyone seeming to borrow money like it is going out of style.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Homeowners, backed by rising house prices, are piling up debt.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The Federal government has thrown fiscal prudence out the window.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The country as a whole is absorbing an astounding three-quarters of global excess savings.</seg>
		<seg id="54">But, as long as interest rates remain low and growth high, Americans can laugh at predictions that their excesses are laying the seeds of ruin.</seg>
		<seg id="55">But if low long-term interest rates are helping so many economies walk on water, why are rates so low, and will they stay that way?</seg>
		<seg id="56">Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Perhaps people have come to feel less , not more, secure about their long-term future, either because of fears about terrorism, a global pandemic, or a severe rash of financial crises.</seg>
		<seg id="58">I am not claiming that investors are hysterical, just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook.</seg>
		<seg id="59">As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Other convincing explanations are lacking.</seg>
		<seg id="61">To be sure, emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree, rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets, but nobody expects this to go on forever.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters, has declared the current situation &quot;a conundrum.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="63">History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out, with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world, raising growth rates everywhere.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Ordinarily, rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates -- that is, unless, deep down, people have become nervous.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Suppose investors are worried about a small chance of catastrophe over the next five to ten years.</seg>
		<seg id="66">(According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the dangers are real.)</seg>
		<seg id="67">Suppose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong, but that maybe -- just maybe -- things will fall apart.</seg>
		<seg id="68">In this case, it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co-exist with strong growth.</seg>
		<seg id="69">True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950's and early 1960's, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Since that was a golden era for global growth, why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today?</seg>
		<seg id="71">What the optimists forget is that the 1950's and 1960's were also a period of massive insecurity.</seg>
		<seg id="72">Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III -- and with good reason, according to many historians.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Back then, the specter of the Apocalypse helped keep borrowing cheap.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Happily, investors' darkest fears were not realized, and we can only hope for the same.</seg>
		<seg id="75">But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today's record-low interest rates, then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation.</seg>
		<seg id="76">Investors' collective psychology is notoriously fragile.</seg>
		<seg id="77">If they ever calm down, interest rates will shoot up, and that could well bring the global economy's simmering imbalances to a raging boil.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Israel's Political Earthquake</seg>
		<seg id="1">Israeli politics is undergoing its most dramatic changes in 30 years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The realignment of parties and leaders is all the more remarkable because the latest developments -- Ariel Sharon's decision to leave the ruling Likud party, the defeat of Shimon Peres as the Labor party's chairman, and Labor's withdrawal from Sharon's grand coalition government -- were utterly unexpected.</seg>
		<seg id="3">So it is all the more important to comprehend the significance of these changes for the future of Israel, the region, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Israel's political system is, to put it simply, coming to the end of its second era.</seg>
		<seg id="5">From independence in 1948 until 1977, the Labor party was dominant, before giving way to an opposition coalition of conservative, nationalist, and centrist parties allied in the Likud bloc.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since then, the two parties have taken turns in power, sometimes in grand coalitions and often in partnership with smaller parties.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On the surface, party competition has been between &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; or &quot;hawks&quot; and &quot;doves.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">The truth, of course, is more complex.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Social class and economic issues, overshadowed by the persistence of more existential concerns -- physical security and the continued existence of the state -- have played a much less important role in Israel than in other societies.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Here, the political divide could be defined as &quot;optimists&quot; versus &quot;pessimists.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">The former, as in Labor, believed that some day a force would emerge among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on a reasonable basis; the latter, as in Likud, were more doubtful.</seg>
		<seg id="12">For years, the argument remained an abstraction, a debate over what might happen in the future, until the Oslo agreement with the PLO in 1993 put the competing perspectives to the test.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Since 2000, when PLO leader Yasir Arafat rejected a political settlement and instead launched a five-year war of terrorism, there have been few optimists left.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The subsequent intellectual realignment in Israel has given rise to a new national consensus.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is now generally accepted that, as the left has always insisted, Israel should be ready to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and accept a Palestinian state in exchange for real peace.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But it is also accepted that, as the right has always maintained, there is no partner ready to make real peace.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In this context, Sharon gained two landslide election victories as a hardliner, but implemented a moderate policy, including a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This is where Israel stands today, facing a political upheaval fueled by two developments.</seg>
		<seg id="19">First, Sharon moved the Likud to the center, making it the hegemonic party, while destroying every stereotype about his personality, methods, and worldview.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For the same reason, though, many within Likud view Sharon -- who helped found the party -- as a traitor.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms, even if he now needs to establish another party to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Second, the Labor party has proven politically bankrupt, with its only conceivable leader being the 82-year-old Shimon Peres and its anachronistic dovish optimism the source of much ridicule.</seg>
		<seg id="23">As a result -- and helped by low voter turnout -- the party's leadership primary was won by Amir Peretz, an outsider and populist who wants to revitalize Labor by putting social and economic issues at the forefront, which means withdrawing from the national unity coalition with Likud.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Despite having to form a new party, Sharon will probably win the next election, which he has called for February.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Peretz's strategy may draw voters from other parties on the left, but Labor will most likely lose centrist voters (and those for whom national security is paramount) to Sharon.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Paradoxically, all of this will mean both a great deal in principle and perhaps little in practice.</seg>
		<seg id="27">With Sharon enjoying a strong public mandate for a moderate policy, Israel will be more ready than ever to make a deal with the Palestinians, Syria, and the Arab world in general for a comprehensive diplomatic solution to the conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yet, given the chaos and paralysis that increasingly characterize Palestinian politics, that opportunity will go untaken.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The rising power of Hamas, which openly proclaims its strategy of increasing terrorism and its goal of destroying Israel, reinforces that trend.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The same can be said of Syria, whose hardline government is turning toward a dangerously adventurous militancy.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements on the West Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But it is now widely recognized that such changes are a response to dim prospects of real progress toward peace.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Holding onto territory as a bargaining chip makes less sense if there is no one with whom to bargain.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Instead, Israel will continue to prioritize its own security, strengthening its defenses against terrorism and consolidating control over the relatively small portions of the West Bank that it intends to claim as part of an eventual diplomatic settlement.</seg>
		<seg id="35">A byproduct of this strategy, combined with ongoing Palestinian attacks, has been growing international sympathy with Israel.</seg>
		<seg id="36">That, too, could continue if the current political realignment proves permanent, enabling Sharon to win over the center and even moderate left for his program.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Nothing is assured, of course.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The still popular Benjamin Netanyahu could emerge as a powerful rival on his right, and Peretz might yet shape Labor into a serious contender on his left.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Nevertheless, the national consensus has shifted, shaking all assumptions about Israeli politics.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The February elections will put those assumptions to their severest test in decades.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Securing the Future at the Evian Summit</seg>
		<seg id="1">The paradox of our time is the great power of the world's richest countries to do good, but their seeming compulsion to miss every opportunity to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US stands as the supreme example of this: a country that devotes $450 billion per year to military spending allocates only $12 billion per year to development assistance for poor countries.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It can bomb Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq, but seems ill-equipped to help these places develop.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Europe is little better, paralyzed as it is by internal divisions and budget deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Next week's G-8 summit in Evian, France is a chance to make a fresh start.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For the one billion people represented at the G-8 Summit, life is extremely good in comparison with the rest of the planet, with average incomes at $25,000 per person or more and life expectancy around 80 years.</seg>
		<seg id="7">For about three billion people in the world today, including China, much of India, and most of East Asia, economic development is proceeding reasonably well, even if it displays a lot of ups and downs (most recently, the shock of the SARS epidemic).</seg>
		<seg id="8">Positive trends are also seen in Brazil and Mexico.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But for the world's remaining two billion people, life remains desperate.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For roughly one billion people, bare survival is nothing short of precarious.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Millions die each year because they lack access to medicines, food, safe drinking water, and basic sanitation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Their life expectancy is often less than 50 years, and is falling in many places.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The G-8 could end the suffering of the world's poorest billion people if it adopted realistic measures to solve their problems.</seg>
		<seg id="14">They fail to do so not only because they are greedy, but also because they are scared.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They think that global poverty is inevitable and too expensive to solve.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But they can solve the problems of the world's poorest--with relatively little effort and with no noticeable negative impact on their own standard of living.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The biggest problem areas are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andean region, and Central Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Other pockets of extreme poverty, in China and India, are on the path of amelioration due to these two giants' rapid economic growth.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But the problems in sub-Saharan Africa, the Andes, and Central Asia are not solving themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="20">These regions are trapped in poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The worst situation, by far, is in Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The US government believes that these countries have only themselves to blame for their poverty.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But this is the ignorant boasting of a rich country that fails to comprehend the situation on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Africa is trapped in poverty for deep-seated reasons.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It suffers from endemic malaria, which is like a SARS pandemic that lasts for centuries, not for a few months.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It suffers from a climate prone to massive droughts and from soils depleted of nutrients.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It suffers from the fact that most of its population lives in the rural interior, without paved roads to reach ports and facilitate access to international trade.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Aside from a few countries in West Africa, it suffers from a serious shortage of energy resources, whether coal or oil or hydroelectric power.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The US never had to grapple with any one of these problems in the severity that they grip Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The ultimate irony is that all of these deep problems are amenable to solutions, albeit solutions that require money.</seg>
		<seg id="31">That is where the G-8 should come in.</seg>
		<seg id="32">All that is required is for the G-8 leaders to commit, at Evian, to follow through on their previous promises, which for years have remained unfulfilled.</seg>
		<seg id="33">During the past three years, the world's leaders have promised concrete action to cut global poverty by one half by the year 2015, in a series of commitments known as the Millennium Development Goals.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But only baby steps have followed.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The US increased foreign aid by perhaps $4 billion a year at the same time that it increased military spending by $150 billion annually and cut taxes by trillions of dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Clearly, the US has the means to do vastly more to help the world's poor, if only it had the foresight.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Specifically, the G-8 leaders should commit to providing adequate financing for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; to raise food productivity in Africa through a new Green Revolution; to ensure that all poor children have the opportunity to go to school; and to ensure that poor people everywhere have access to clean drinking water and sanitation.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The total cost of this agenda, remarkably, would be much less than 1% of the annual income of rich countries.</seg>
		<seg id="39">For the first time in history, the rich are so rich, and the poor so poor, that a tiny effort by the rich could end massive suffering.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The Evian Summit will clarify whether greed, ignorance, and the bombast of war have closed the eyes of the US entirely, and whether Europe and Japan will look inward rather than outward.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Case for Slowing Population Growth</seg>
		<seg id="1">Global debates about population policy are confusing.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One side argues that rising human populations threaten our environment and prosperity.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Land, water, energy, and biodiversity all seem to be under greater stress than ever, and population growth appears to be a major source of that stress.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The other side of the debate, mainly in rich countries, argues that households are now having so few children that there won't be enough to care for aging parents.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Those who fret about population growth have the better argument.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Issues confronting Europe, Japan, and to a lesser extent the United States and some middle-income countries concerning aging populations are manageable.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Moreover, the benefits of slower population growth outweigh the adjustment costs.</seg>
		<seg id="8">By contrast, if global populations continue to rise rapidly, the stresses on the world's resources will worsen.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Governments should therefore refrain from deliberate policies to raise birthrates, even in places where birth rates are low.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Part of the confusion of the public debate reflects different population trends in different parts of the world.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The fastest population growth is taking place in the poorest regions.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Poor people, especially poor people living on farms, tend to have the most children (often six or more per woman), and therefore the highest rates of population growth.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and for security when parents reach old age.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Poor families lack access to contraception and family planning.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Finally, poor families have many children as a kind of insurance policy against high child mortality rates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As a result of high fertility rates in Africa, the UN Population Division predicts a doubling of Africa's population from around 900 million today to around 1.8 billion in 2050.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Rapidly growing populations are also young populations, because of the high number of children per household.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In Africa, the median age is now a mere 19 years and is projected to rise to around 28 years in 2050.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Europe, the trends run in the other direction.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The UN projects a decline in population to around 630 million in 2050, from around 725 million people today.</seg>
		<seg id="21">With few children and longer life expectancy, the median age of the population rises sharply in this forecast, from 39 years in 2005 to around 48 years in 2050.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For the world as a whole, population is expected to continue to grow by another 2.5 billion people from 2005 to 2050.</seg>
		<seg id="23">All of that growth will be in the developing world: 1.3 billion more people in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, the rest in Latin America and other regions.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adding another 2.5 billion people to the planet will put enormous strains not only on societies with rising populations, but on the entire planet.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Total energy use is soaring, reflecting the combined effect of rising per capita incomes - and thus rising per capita energy use - and population growth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Higher energy use is already changing the world's climate in dangerous ways.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Furthermore, the strains of increased global populations, combined with income growth, are leading to rapid deforestation, depletion of fisheries, land degradation, and the loss of habitat and extinction of a vast number of animal and plant species.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Population growth in developing regions - especially Africa, India, and other parts of Asia - needs to slow.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Public policies can play an important role by extending access to family planning services to the poor, expanding social security systems, reducing child mortality through public health investments, and improving education and job opportunities for women.</seg>
		<seg id="30">A part of the European public, looking at Europe's looming population decline, wants to head in the other direction, promoting a return to larger families.</seg>
		<seg id="31">That would be a big mistake.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Advocates of faster European population growth worry that there won't be enough young workers to pay for public pensions.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But this concern can be met through increased saving by today's young and middle-aged as they prepare for retirement, and by working past the age of 65.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These workers will reap large benefits from living in societies with stable or gradually declining populations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Most obviously, they will spend much less in direct household expenditures to raise children.</seg>
		<seg id="36">They will also save on investments in new roads, power plants, schools, and other public services.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They will enjoy less congested cities and fewer environmental pressures on the countryside.</seg>
		<seg id="38">European economies will face lower costs in limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from energy use, leading to more effective control of climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The quality of life, in short, will tend to improve as Europe's population declines in coming decades.</seg>
		<seg id="40">There is nothing radical in calling for slower population growth.</seg>
		<seg id="41">For tens of thousands of years, the human population tended to rise and fall without a substantial long-term trend.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Only in the past two centuries, with the rise of modern economic life, did the world's population soar, from around one billion people in 1820 to 6.3 billion today and around 9 billion by 2050.</seg>
		<seg id="43">This explosive growth was made possible by huge advances in science and technology.</seg>
		<seg id="44">But this unprecedented growth has also put tremendous pressures on the planet.</seg>
		<seg id="45">We should intensify our efforts to slow population growth through voluntary means, and we should recognize that leveling off of the Earth's population now would add to human happiness and strengthen environmental sustainability later.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Are Foreign Investors Still Welcome?</seg>
		<seg id="1">World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have soared over the past two decades, from $40 billion in the early 1980's to $900 billion last year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The cumulative stock of FDI has reached close to $10 trillion, making it the most important mechanism for delivery of goods and services to foreign markets: sales by foreign affiliates total roughly $19 trillion, compared to world exports of $11 trillion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At the same time, the liberalization of FDI regimes by virtually all countries has been a driving force of intra-firm trade -- the lifeblood of the emerging system of integrated international production and already around one-third of world trade.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But are the good times coming to an end?</seg>
		<seg id="5">FDI can bring a range of benefits, but it also can have costs.</seg>
		<seg id="6">During the 1970's, when the transnational corporations (TNC's) undertaking such investment caught the public eye, many governments believed that the costs of FDI outweighed its benefits, so they controlled it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Led by the developed countries, the pendulum began to swing in the 1980's.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Once viewed as part of the problem, FDI became part of the solution to economic growth and development.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nothing exemplifies this more than changes in national FDI regimes.</seg>
		<seg id="10">As the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reports, of the 2,156 changes that took place between 1991 and 2004, 93% were in the direction of creating a more hospitable environment for TNC's.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there is a real danger that the pendulum is beginning to swing back, leading to a reversal of that liberalization process.</seg>
		<seg id="12">FDI in developed countries (and increasingly in emerging markets) often takes the form of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;amp;A's).</seg>
		<seg id="13">Resistance to such M&amp;amp;A's is becoming more frequent when they involve domestic firms that are regarded by politicians as &quot;national champions&quot; or important for national security, economic development, or cultural identity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The growing involvement of private equity groups in M&amp;amp;A activity implies additional controversy, as such transactions are typically regarded as being purely speculative.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the name of &quot;economic patriotism,&quot; security, and other considerations, resistance to M&amp;amp;A's is being codified in an increasing number of countries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For example, a United States Senate committee recently sought to block the planned liberalization of foreign takeover rules for airlines, while Europe has enacted more restrictive takeover laws.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Moreover, governments are applying more strictly existing regulatory provisions concerning the vetting of takeovers by foreign firms.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNC's from emerging markets, the &quot;new kids on the block.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">Established TNC's, and their home countries, will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As we know from other contexts, adjustment to newcomers is not easy: compare, say, the reaction to the tie-up between France's Alcatel and America's Lucent to the bids by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation for Chevron or Mittal for Acelor.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Another type of defensive reaction -- this time to outward FDI -- may well arise once the offshoring of services gathers more speed.</seg>
		<seg id="22">All indications are that offshoring has reached the tipping point, and more of it will take place through FDI.</seg>
		<seg id="23">If home countries do not put in place the adjustment mechanisms to deal with the rapidly unfolding revolution in making service industry jobs tradable, a backlash against such outward FDI will become inevitable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The growing unease with FDI is so far largely confined to developed countries.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But there are signs that it is spreading to emerging markets.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In the case of large-scale projects, some host countries are raising questions about the contracts that define their relationship with TNC's, and governments are reviewing such contracts because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that they did not get a fair deal.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Of the 219 known international arbitration cases concerning investment projects, some two-thirds were initiated during the past three years.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Approaches to FDI have changed in the past, and they can change again in the future, depending on how governments view the balance of costs and benefits.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This balance involves not only economic factors, but also such considerations as security and the desire to control one's own economic development.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The concept of &quot;twenty-first-century nationalization,&quot; introduced by Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala, mirrors in this respect the &quot;economic patriotism&quot; of French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Reservations against FDI (as against anything foreign) can be found in all groups of countries, and politicians can bring them to the surface, resulting in protectionism.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It would be ironic, though, if developed countries -- which led the FDI liberalization wave of the past two decades -- now led a backlash against FDI.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Let us hope that the de-liberalization seen in developed countries can be checked before it spreads to other parts of the world and ultimately brings undesirable consequences for all.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Cultivating Energy</seg>
		<seg id="1">From climate change to volatile oil prices, all signs point to a looming global energy crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Confronting the growing challenge means that humanity can no longer afford to ignore the inexhaustible resource found in the organic material that the sun provides each day through photosynthesis.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Solar energy enables plants to absorb carbon gas and thereby produce not only oxygen, but also matter that the animal kingdom uses for food -- and that our machines can use for energy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Since the Neolithic (or late Stone Age) period, humans have been cultivating this &quot;biomass&quot; in order to feed itself.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Yet, even in today's world, its energy potential is ignored.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Beginning with the industrial revolution, humans sought energy from coal, and later from oil and natural gas, but this leads to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Existing alternatives for diversifying energy production are limited.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nuclear energy presents a number of disadvantages, owing to concerns about safety and disposal of radioactive waste.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Hydroelectric power is already widely used, while wind and solar energy are structurally sporadic and disparately available.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Biomass, on the other hand, has several advantages.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Supplies of it are large and available throughout the world.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moreover, the technology necessary to convert it into energy -- including high-yield burning, gas conversion, and liquefaction into synthetic fuel -- has long been mastered.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Widely used during World War II, this technology has since advanced considerably.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Biomass energy, however, is the victim of unfair competition from fossil fuels.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Oil's price reflects its extraction, refining, and distribution costs, but not that of creating the raw material.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Millions of years and 200 tons of plant matter are necessary to produce one liter of oil, whereas just 15 kilograms of plant matter are required to make one liter of synthetic fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="17">After the oil glut, with oil below $20 a barrel, interest in developing energy from biomass ebbed, attractive only to &quot;green&quot; militants and those interested in fundamental science.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Yet the potential is immense.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The planet's biomass -- forests, pastureland, savannas, and crops -- make up productive capital that generates a 10% &quot;return&quot; every year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Like a battery that runs out and is then recharged by the sun, this supply is renewable indefinitely, as long as it is managed properly.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The annual return on this capital is currently estimated at 60 billion tons, yet only two billion tons is consumed for food purposes and 10 billion tons for energy.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Increasing the responsible use of this energy source would contribute to the fight against climate change by reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and diminishing the amount of fossil fuel required to produce energy.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Moreover, its abundance in southern countries promises to facilitate their economic development.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Considered the &quot;energy of the poor&quot; until today, biomass could become a source of wealth if it is grown and harnessed with the support of the international community.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Thus, &quot;energy crops&quot; could be developed to produce biofuel.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Residue from forest, agricultural, and agro-industrial activities could be collected and converted.</seg>
		<seg id="27">For example, the six million tons of waste produced annually by Niger could theoretically be used to meet that country's entire energy needs.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, in many places, energy cropping would certainly compete with food crops.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Long-term estimates project that over a 50-year time horizon, most of the planet's arable land would have to be used to feed the world and for forest conservation.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Thus, areas dedicated to energy production, particularly biofuel, may not reach the level that societies would wish.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But, while such competition would reveal new global scarcities, it would also bring higher prices, thereby encouraging producers to increase yields and productivity.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Thus, while cultivating energy would create new constraints, it would also open new possibilities for many economic actors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The farmer and the forest worker could become more involved in the market, the mine engineer could begin to take an interest in crop fields, the banker in plant shares, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But, in order to prepare for a scaling up of energy cropping, new policies must be implemented, both in northern and southern countries, in terms of agriculture, land and water management, protection of biodiversity, fuel taxes, and information and awareness-raising.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The ancient Egyptians and the Incas practiced a religion of the Sun, believing it to be at the beginning of all life on Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Science has since proven this to be the case.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Nowadays, when it has become more important than ever that we embrace renewable resources, we should use the Sun to cultivate our energy, just as our ancestors used it to cultivate their food.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Culture of Entrepreneurship</seg>
		<seg id="1">Governments around the world want to promote entrepreneurship.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Though most business start-ups will never amount to much, each little company is an experiment, and a great deal of experimentation is necessary to produce the occasional firm that can transform a nation's economy -- or even rise to international significance.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In short, entrepreneurship is an incubator, and one that is essential to long-term economic success.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In explaining the variation in levels of entrepreneurship across countries, much attention is devoted nowadays to differences in national attitudes and policies.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But there are also significant differences in levels of entrepreneurship within individual countries.</seg>
		<seg id="6">People from Shanghai are said to be more entrepreneurial than people in Beijing.</seg>
		<seg id="7">People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In a recent study, Mariassunta Giannetti and Andrei Simonov of the Stockholm School of Economics show the magnitude of differences in levels of entrepreneurship across Swedish municipalities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They define entrepreneurs as people who report income from a company that they control and work in at least part-time, and find that the proportion of entrepreneurs in the population differs substantially across the 289 municipalities that they studied, ranging from 1.5% to 18.5%.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What can these differences tell us about the real causes of entrepreneurship?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Policy changes at the national level cannot account for the variation Gianetti and Simonov found.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the 1980's and early 1990's, centralized wage-setting agreements were dissolved and the Swedish government cut personal and corporate tax rates.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The level of entrepreneurial activity in the country as a whole doubled as a result, but the response was very different from one municipality to another.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Why?</seg>
		<seg id="15">Cultural variables seem to explain a lot: religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Municipalities tended to have more entrepreneurs if they had a high proportion of pensioners who were members of the Church of Sweden (the official state church until 2000) and a high proportion of right-wing voters.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Beyond that, a feedback mechanism appears to be in place: cities with more entrepreneurs tend to beget still more entrepreneurs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Once an entrepreneurial culture takes root, it typically spreads locally, as people learn about business and begin to feel attracted by it -- even if it doesn't yield an immediate or certain payoff.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Indeed, Giannetti and Simonov discovered that the average income of entrepreneurs was lower in high-entrepreneurship municipalities than in the low-entrepreneurship ones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Similarly, studies from other countries show that entrepreneurs often have lower initial earnings and earnings growth than they would have as employees.</seg>
		<seg id="21">What these studies suggest is that differences in the degree of entrepreneurship may be due less to better economic opportunities (the &quot;supply&quot; side of the entrepreneurship equation) than to cultural differences that make entrepreneurship personally more rewarding (the &quot;demand&quot; side).</seg>
		<seg id="22">This hypothesis is supported by Giannetti and Simonov, who argue that differences in the prestige of entrepreneurs across municipalities may account for differences in levels of entrepreneurship.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In some municipalities, entrepreneurs enjoy high social status, regardless of whether they are already successful; elsewhere they are looked down upon and other occupations are more admired.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The idea that prestige is important is not new.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In her book Money, Morals &amp;amp; Manners, the sociologist Michèle Lamont compared definitions of success in France and the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a &quot;worthy person.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">In essence, she was asking people about their sense of what is important in life and about their own personal sense of identity.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Lamont's study confirmed the conventional wisdom that Americans value business success, while the French place greater value on culture and quality of life.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Likewise, open contempt of &quot;money-hungry&quot; businesspeople and competition is expressed more often in France than in America.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But, while Lamont focused on differences between the French and the Americans, her study's most interesting finding was that of significant differences between regions within France.</seg>
		<seg id="31">She compared Clermont-Ferrand, the capital of Auvergne, in the center of France, with Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Auvergne's inhabitants have a reputation for being parsimonious and stern, and, despite substantial recent progress, for a relative dearth of high culture.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Lamont found that people in both Paris and Clermont-Ferrand tended to express contempt for &quot;money-grubbing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">But the Clermontois valued &quot;simplicity, pragmatism, hard work, and resolve,&quot; while the Parisians put more stress on &quot;pizzazz and brilliance.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="35">She concluded that, &quot;In many respects the Clermontois are closer to the Hoosiers (as the residents of the US mid-Western state of Indiana are called) than to the Parisians.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="36">Her evidence suggests that in Clermont-Ferrand, as compared to Paris, there is a higher intrinsic demand for starting small businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Differences in how these cultures define what it means to be a worthy person, and how worthiness is signaled, probably explain much of the variation in levels of entrepreneurship.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Economists and others often tend to look at countries as a whole and emphasize national attitudes and national policies as the main factors in encouraging or discouraging entrepreneurship.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But, in fact, the national success in entrepreneurship depends on the evolution of local cultures and their interaction with national policies.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Entrepreneurship can take root in culturally congenial regions of any country after economic barriers against it are lifted, and then feed on itself to grow to national significance.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Ivy League Investors</seg>
		<seg id="1">Yale University, where I teach, has entrusted its endowment portfolio to one man, David Swensen, for over 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">During this period, the portfolio has grown from just over $1 billion to $18 billion -- an average return of more than 16% a year, which appears to be the highest of any major university.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And it shows no signs of diminishing: in the latest fiscal year ending in June, the return was 22.9%.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Presidents of Yale have come and gone, but Swensen stays on.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He has done more for the university than any president, or anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In a university, ideas count more than money, but $18 billion dollars can create an environment for many new ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With 11,500 students, that is more than $1.5 million per student (not including the university's buildings and art collection, each worth many billions of dollars more).</seg>
		<seg id="8">How did this happen?</seg>
		<seg id="9">How did Swensen make so much money?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Everyone is wondering -- not least those of us at Yale.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After all, many people here have been teaching the &quot;efficient markets hypothesis&quot; that financial markets around the world have become so competitive that it is impossible to make more than a normal return from investing.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Anyone who beats the market must simply be lucky.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Studies seem to confirm this.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For example, a 2004 study by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean of the University of California and Yi-Tsung Lee and Yiu-Jane Liu at National Chengchi University acquired trade-by-trade data on individual day traders on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The study found that only the top 1% of day traders made a profit -- after deducting trading costs -- in two consecutive six-month periods, and the median profit was hardly worth the effort: only about US$4000.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is easy to conclude that there is just no point in even trying to beat the market.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But then one remembers people like Swensen.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Can his consistent performance really be attributed to luck?</seg>
		<seg id="19">Robert Kiyosaki, author of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series of popular investment books, bases his books' titles and themes on a comparison of his own highly-educated father with his friend's father, an eighth-grade dropout.</seg>
		<seg id="20">According to Kiyosaki, his poor but scholarly dad tended to be pessimistic about one's ability to achieve anything in the real world, so he discouraged his son from even trying.</seg>
		<seg id="21">By contrast, the friend's dad relished trying to achieve something big.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Is it just a coincidence that he was rich?</seg>
		<seg id="23">Kiyosaki may try too hard to be inspirational, but I often think of him when I hear finance professors opine on the efficiency of markets and the futility of making money by trading in them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Maybe many academics find it difficult to take the initiative to achieve in the real world -- I have yet to meet another professor who has mentioned having read Kiyosaki.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But Swensen is an academic, with a Ph.D. in economics.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He is surrounded by academics.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Somehow, all this talk about efficient markets has not discouraged him from trying, and succeeding.</seg>
		<seg id="28">There seems to be a pattern.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Two similar universities, Harvard and Princeton, have had nearly the same success.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Harvard endowment, under Jack Meyer, earned a 15.2% average annual return over the last ten years, compared to Swensen's 17.2% average, while the Princeton endowment, under Andrew Golden, earned an average of 15.6% per year.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In fact, Golden worked under Swensen at Yale from 1988 until 1993.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Swensen has written two books about investing, one for professionals and one for the general public.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I did not come away from reading them with a feeling that I know how to do what he did.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But a couple of things stand out.</seg>
		<seg id="35">One is his long-term focus.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yale lets Swensen invest for the very long term, and does not bother him about quarterly performance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Maybe this allows him to focus more on long-term fundamentals -- and thus to make investments that may not perform well in the short run.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But, in fact, he has done consistently well in both the short term and the long term.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Part of the reason for Swensen's success is &quot;absolute return,&quot; a term -- now widely quoted in the investment community -- that he coined for unusual investment strategies involving such things as merger arbitrage and distressed securities.</seg>
		<seg id="40">He also has invested in non-traditional asset classes, including real estate, oil, timber, private equity, and venture capital and buyout firms.</seg>
		<seg id="41">These assets are generally not followed by multiple analysts, and are not easily understood, giving him a greater advantage in applying his intellectual skills and the skills of others around him.</seg>
		<seg id="42">In these senses, Swensen is completely different from day traders, who are both investing for the short term and trying to beat the most crowded market -- the market for exchange-listed securities.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But I also think that the phenomenal success of Swensen and others like him reflects the environment that Kiyosaki criticizes.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The problem is a defeatist attitude, not scholarship.</seg>
		<seg id="45">When an analytical mind, a mind that is trained to search rigorously for the truth and as part of a community of such people is set free from self-doubt, it can do amazing things.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Knowing David Swensen, I can attest that he is not a lonely day trader trying to beat the market.</seg>
		<seg id="47">He is a good listener, is supportive of people he trusts, and is surrounded by a lot of good people with a wide array of skills.</seg>
		<seg id="48">And he is certainly not a defeatist.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Ethics of Eating</seg>
		<seg id="1">Global meat consumption is predicted to double by 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yet in Europe and North America, there is growing concern about the ethics of the way meat and eggs are produced.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called &quot;white&quot; -- actually pale pink -- veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anemic, denied roughage, and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In Europe, mad cow disease shocked many people, not only because it shattered beef's image as a safe and healthy food, but also because they learned that the disease was caused by feeding cattle the brains and nerve tissue of sheep.</seg>
		<seg id="5">People who naively believed that cows ate grass discovered that beef cattle in feed lots may be fed anything from corn to fish meal, chicken litter (complete with chicken droppings), and slaughterhouse waste.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Concern about how we treat farm animals is far from being limited to the small percentage of people who are vegetarians or even vegans -- eating no animal products at all.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Despite strong ethical arguments for vegetarianism, it is not yet a mainstream position.</seg>
		<seg id="8">More common is the view that we are justified in eating meat, as long as the animals have a decent life before they are killed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The problem, as Jim Mason and I describe in our recent book, The Way We Eat, is that industrial agriculture denies animals even a minimally decent life.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Tens of billions of chickens produced today never go outdoors.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They are bred to have voracious appetites and gain weight as fast as possible, then reared in sheds that can hold more than 20,000 birds.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The level of ammonia in the air from their accumulated droppings stings the eye and hurts the lungs.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Slaughtered at only 45 days old, their immature bones can hardly bear the weight of their bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Some collapse and, unable to reach food or water, soon die, their fate irrelevant to the economics of the enterprise as a whole.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Conditions are, if anything, even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But there are usually at least four hens per cage, and often more.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Under such crowded conditions, the more dominant, aggressive birds are likely to peck to death the weaker hens in the cage.</seg>
		<seg id="18">To prevent this, producers sear off all birds' beaks with a hot blade.</seg>
		<seg id="19">A hen's beak is full of nerve tissue -- it is, after all, her principal means of relating to her environment -- but no anesthetic or analgesic is used to relieve the pain.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Pigs may be the most intelligent and sensitive of the animals that we commonly eat.</seg>
		<seg id="21">When foraging in a rural village, they can exercise that intelligence and explore their varied environment.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Before they give birth, sows use straw or leaves and twigs to build a comfortable and safe nest in which to nurse their litter.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But in today's factory farms, pregnant sows are kept in crates so narrow that they cannot turn around, or even walk more than a step forward or backward.</seg>
		<seg id="24">They lie on bare concrete without straw or any other form of bedding.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible, so that she can be made pregnant again, but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Defenders of these production methods argue that they are a regrettable but necessary response to a growing population's demand for food.</seg>
		<seg id="27">On the contrary, when we confine animals in factory farms, we have to grow food for them.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The animals burn up most of that food's energy just to breathe and keep their bodies warm, so we end up with a small fraction -- usually no more than one-third and sometimes as little as one-tenth -- of the food value that we feed them.</seg>
		<seg id="29">By contrast, cows grazing on pasture eat food that we cannot digest, which means that they add to the amount of food available to us.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is tragic that countries like China and India, as they become more prosperous, are copying Western methods and putting animals in huge industrial farms to supply more meat and eggs for their growing middle classes.</seg>
		<seg id="31">If this continues, the result will be animal suffering on an even greater scale than now exists in the West, as well as more environmental damage and a rise in heart disease and cancers of the digestive system.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It will also be grossly inefficient.</seg>
		<seg id="33">As consumers, we have the power -- and the moral obligation -- to refuse to support farming methods that are cruel to animals and bad for us.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Fear and Freedom on the Internet</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier this month it was reported that, at the request of China's rulers, Microsoft shut down the Web site of a Chinese blogger that was maintained on a Microsoft service called MSN Spaces.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The blogger, Zhao Jing, had been reporting on a strike by journalists at The Beijing News that followed the dismissal of the newspaper's independent-minded editor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Microsoft's action raises a key question: can the Internet really be a force for freedom that repressive governments cannot control as easily as newspapers, radio, and television?</seg>
		<seg id="4">Ironically, Microsoft's founder and chairman, Bill Gates, has been an enthusiastic advocate of this view.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Just last October, he said: &quot;There's really no way to, in a broad sense, repress information today, and I think that's a wonderful advance we can all feel good about….[T]his is a medium of total openness and total freedom, and that's what makes it so special.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Despite these sentiments, Microsoft is helping the Chinese authorities to repress information as best they can.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A Microsoft spokeswoman was reported as saying that the corporation has blocked &quot;many sites&quot; in China, and it has been known for several months that Microsoft's blog tool in China filters words like &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;human rights&quot; from blog titles.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Microsoft's defense is that it must &quot;comply with local and global laws.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the MSN Spaces sites are maintained on servers in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The relevant local laws would therefore seem to be those of the US, and Zhao Jing's discussion of the Beijing journalists' strike does not violate any of them.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Nor are there any global laws that prevent Chinese people from discussing events that their government would prefer them not to discuss.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The New York Times, for example, is free to publish its report on the strike, even though it operates a Web site that anyone with unfettered Internet access can read.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If the Chinese government does not want its citizens to read a foreign newspaper, then it is up to them to figure out how to block access to it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The newspaper is under no obligation to do it for them.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So Microsoft's defense misfires.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We can only guess at the company's real reason for taking down the Web site, but fear of repercussions against its commercial interests in China seems likely to have been an important factor.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To be sure, a corporation can and should place limits on the use of its services.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The absolutist line -- let complete freedom of expression prevail -- crumbles in the face of uncomfortable examples.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to Gates, Microsoft might prevent the use of its services to spread instructions about making nuclear bombs, to send pro-Nazi statements into Germany, where such material is illegal, and to propagate child pornography.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But how relevant are such examples?</seg>
		<seg id="21">In his classic defense of freedom of expression, On Liberty, John Stuart Mill argued that the most important reason for freedom of expression is to promote competition between the widest possible range of ideas, and that unfettered debate is the best way to test them.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For the government to protect ideas from criticism is to turn them into a lifeless and rigid dogma, regardless of whether they are true.</seg>
		<seg id="23">If we agree with Mill, then only one of Gates's examples falls into the category of expression that should be protected.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Recipes for making nuclear bombs are techniques, not ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nor is child pornography the expression of ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="26">We may therefore restrict both of them without running afoul of Mill's argument.</seg>
		<seg id="27">(On the other hand, an essay arguing that there is nothing wrong with adults taking a sexual interest in children, and that such conduct should be permitted, expresses ideas, and thus should not be censored, no matter how poisonous we may consider them.)</seg>
		<seg id="28">The most difficult of Gates's three examples is that of pro-Nazi statements on a Web site aimed at Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It is easy to understand why Germany would wish to prohibit such statements.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Several countries' laws proscribe incitement of racial hatred, which can be justified, consistently with Mill's defense of liberty, if such laws really focus narrowly on incitement of hatred rather than on suppressing arguments, bad as they may be, that appeal to people's intellectual capacities.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A defender of suppression of Nazi ideas might argue that have already been tried, and have failed -- in the most horrendous manner imaginable -- to produce a better society.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Nevertheless, the best possible sign that Germany has overcome its Nazi past would be to focus its laws specifically on incitement to racial hatred, rather than on Nazism as such.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In any case, China's crackdown on straightforward reporting and discussion of events taking place in that country is not the suppression of a discredited political ideology, but of open and informed political debate.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If Bill Gates really believes that the Internet should be a liberating force, he should ensure that Microsoft does not do the dirty work of China's government.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Weakness of the Strong Dollar</seg>
		<seg id="1">It is always risky to write about exchange rates.</seg>
		<seg id="2">If a currency's exchange rate is falling, it may well be rising by the time one's article appears.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But the issue of how we should think about exchange rates and their appropriate management is a perennial one.</seg>
		<seg id="4">So what is at issue now is not just the falling dollar, but rather what US officials intend to do about it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Paul O'Neill, the outspoken US Treasury Secretary, suggests that there is little the US could or would do to sustain the dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="6">His remarks were criticized by some as abandoning the strong dollar policy that was the Clinton Administration's hallmark.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One responsibility of economic leadership is to dispel economic myths--certainly not to create them.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The &quot;strong dollar&quot; policy represents an especially egregious example of an economic myth; it seems to suggest that the US Treasury could, and would, maintain the strong dollar, and that a strong dollar is good for the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, I was often asked if I supported the strong dollar policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I replied that I believed in an &quot;equilibrium dollar.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">In other words, exchange rates are no different from other prices.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Like the price of apples and oranges, market forces should determine them.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Anyone who says he believes in a &quot;strong orange policy&quot; would be ridiculed.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Yet some of those who seem to have the greatest faith in market forces treat exchange rates as if they were governed by laws other than those of standard economics, so that a word or even a look from a finance minister could lead currencies to soar or plummet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Of course, there is considerable irrationality in currency markets.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Keynes once described asset markets as beauty contests, in which the objective is not to ascertain who is the most beautiful person, but whom others will think is the most beautiful.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The objective in currency markets is, indeed, often to guess what others will be thinking.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But even if government intervention can affect exchange rates in the short run, in the longer run, it is market fundamentals that matter.</seg>
		<seg id="19">There may be a legitimate role for government in limiting excessive volatility, but if underlying economic fundamentals do not drive the exchange rate, what is the basis of our confidence in the market system?</seg>
		<seg id="20">Belief in misguided notions inevitably leads to further nonsense.</seg>
		<seg id="21">On one occasion, a reporter queried the US Treasury on the adverse effects of the strong dollar on exports (at the time, car sales and other exports were suffering.)</seg>
		<seg id="22">The response was that the strong dollar meant a strong economy, and a strong economy strengthens the ability to export.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But of course, even the US Treasury, as powerful as it may be, cannot repeal the laws of economics.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Demand curves are downward sloping: typically, at higher prices, others will demand less of Americana goods, and a strong dollar means that American goods are more expensive.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Perhaps the most important objection to the strong dollar policy is that it encourages precisely this confusion between a strong dollar and a strong economy.</seg>
		<seg id="26">We should no more be emotionally attached to the exchange rate than to any other price.</seg>
		<seg id="27">A stronger exchange rate discourages exports, and when an economy is facing rising unemployment, it can make a bad situation worse.</seg>
		<seg id="28">On the other hand, a higher exchange rate may also lead to lower inflation, as import prices fall.</seg>
		<seg id="29">When inflation is the primary concern, a strong exchange rate may be good for the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The strong dollar policy reeks of an economic nationalism that is out of step with the era of globalization.</seg>
		<seg id="31">If the dollar is strong, then the euro or the yen is weak.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But how are political and economic leaders in other countries to respond?</seg>
		<seg id="33">Should they simply agree to the strong dollar policy, even though it implies a weak yen or euro policy?</seg>
		<seg id="34">What is required is a debate with the US, for the strong dollar has led to an anomalous situation: the world's richest country seems unable to live within its means and must continually borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from abroad to finance its huge trade deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The strong dollar--far more than Japanese protectionism--fuelled the bilateral deficit with Japan.</seg>
		<seg id="36">It also contributed to protectionism at home, reflected in the new US steel tariffs.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It is high time that the nonsense of the strong dollar policy be laid to rest.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Paul O'Neill should be commended for helping in this effort.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Perhaps we can now begin to think more seriously about creating an international economic system that acknowledges the devastating effects that market volatility among major currencies has on less developed countries, and that ensures greater stability.</seg>
		<seg id="40">For too long, we have blamed the victims.</seg>
		<seg id="41">That has merely permitted us to avoid taking a hard look at the system itself.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is China Cheating?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Foul play!</seg>
		<seg id="2">How else, says the US, could China undercut American producers in so many areas?</seg>
		<seg id="3">For decades America seemed to dominate manufacturing, so US officials focused on liberalizing trade in manufactured goods.</seg>
		<seg id="4">They put little effort into creating a level playing field for farmers, since they knew America couldn't compete in agriculture.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now, China is out-competing everyone, racking up huge trade surpluses with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="6">So America's Treasury Secretary accuses China of deliberately keepings its exchange rate low, and calls for China to let market forces determine the value of the reminbi.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The IMF's departing Chief Economist, Ken Rogoff, warns that the surpluses put global stability at risk.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For those who recall East Asia's crisis of five years ago, much of this seems to run counter to what was said then.</seg>
		<seg id="9">China was urged not to float its currency.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Until Argentina's peso imploded, fixed exchange rates were fine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The US Treasury welcomed government intervention in exchange rate markets, and encouraged the IMF to support such interventions with mega-billion dollar loans to crisis countries.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If China had let its currency float back then, it would have depreciated in value, deepening the crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Countries were warned: avoid trade deficits and build up reserves, because they are the key frontline defense.</seg>
		<seg id="14">East Asia's countries followed that advice, and for a good reason: they had seen the consequences of a lack of reserves.</seg>
		<seg id="15">East Asia's governments knew then that the IMF's policies would deepen their downturns, but they were helpless to resist.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The IMF had the money they needed.</seg>
		<seg id="17">China and Malaysia, lucky enough not to have to turn to the IMF or brave enough to set their own course, did what every textbook said you should do: they pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.</seg>
		<seg id="18">China's economy continued to grow at 7%; Malaysia had the shortest and shallowest downturn.</seg>
		<seg id="19">To understand what is at stake, a few basic economic points need to be spelled out.</seg>
		<seg id="20">First, international trade is based on the principle of comparative advantage; countries export goods in which they have a relative advantage and import goods in which they have a relative disadvantage.</seg>
		<seg id="21">By and large, America now has a relative disadvantage in manufacturing, while China has a relative advantage.</seg>
		<seg id="22">China should be exporting manufactured goods to the US.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Secondly, if a country invests more than it saves, it will need to borrow, and the counterpart to that borrowing is a trade deficit.</seg>
		<seg id="24">America's burgeoning trade deficit is a result of the Bush Administration's unprecedented mismanagement.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Tax cuts that America could ill afford turned a huge fiscal surplus into a massive deficit; rather than saving, America's government is borrowing, much of it from abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="26">That, not China's exchange rate policy, is the culprit.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, China's overall trade surplus today is actually small, around 1% of its GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Of course, the Bush Administration wants to shift the blame, but neither China, nor anyone else, should be fooled.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This is reminiscent of what happened twenty years ago, when President Reagan engineered huge tax cuts that were supposed to pay for themselves, but which incited huge fiscal deficits, which in turn led to huge trade deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Back then, Japan was blamed!</seg>
		<seg id="31">The harsh truth is that neither the IMF nor the Bush administration really believes in free markets.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They interfere with markets when it suits their purposes.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The Bush Administration supported bailouts for airlines, unprecedented subsidies for agriculture, and tariff protections for steel.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The IMF is right: there is a real risk of global instability, but the underlying cause is massive US borrowing from abroad, which began under President Reagan.</seg>
		<seg id="35">This turned the US into a huge debtor.</seg>
		<seg id="36">If, someday, America's creditors decide that they want to hold fewer dollars, it could set off large exchange rate movements, causing global instability.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Why hasn't the IMF sternly criticized these deficits?</seg>
		<seg id="38">Why should the richest country in the world live beyond its means while the IMF scolds poorer countries for smaller transgressions?</seg>
		<seg id="39">This problem is compounded by the global reserve system, which sees most countries demanding US dollars, effectively to bury them in the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The system requires the reserve currency country (the US) to be a massive debtor--to the point where others lose faith.</seg>
		<seg id="41">But to solve deep-seated problems with the global financial system, we need to go beyond the complacency that has long marked the G-7 and the unilateralism that defines the current US administration.</seg>
		<seg id="42">China is right to have ignored America's demands.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Floating the exchange rate would expose the country to instabilities that would lead to a host of further problems, particularly the country's shaky banking system.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A higher exchange rate would undermine job creation and would contribute to deflation, which China is successfully combating.</seg>
		<seg id="45">China is fortunate to have the freedom to follow its own views.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Its huge foreign currency reserves give it the freedom to ignore the IMF and the US Treasury.</seg>
		<seg id="47">In the end, this may be the most compelling reason for why China should continue to run trade surpluses.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Once again, China has shown its mastery of basic economic principles.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Others in the region only wish that they could have acted similarly.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Can Italy Survive Berlusconi?</seg>
		<seg id="1">If history seems likely to rank Silvio Berlusconi as an inconsequential Prime Minister of Italy, it will surely remember him as an extraordinary -- and extraordinarily bizarre -- one.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Promising one thing and delivering another was not so much a weakness of his government as its organizing principle.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Given the erratic nature of Berlusconi's rule, it is no surprise that, ever since the 2001 election that returned him to power, the center-left l'Unione coalition has won all subsequent elections -- administrative, regional, and European.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Yet the left's prospects in the upcoming parliamentary election are far from certain, and Berlusconi seems far from doomed.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Given the country's economic conditions, one would think that Italy is ripe for decisive change.</seg>
		<seg id="6">For the last four years, average growth in incomes has been a mere 0.3%, compared to 1.5% in the European Union, and in the past two years public debt has again started to rise.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Moreover, the strategy of Berlusconi's ruling center-right Casa della Libertà coalition has been to tread water and wait for Europe's economy to pick up instead of tackling Italy's structural difficulties.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result, the government is criticized not only by the unions, but also by the employers' association, Confindustria, which in 2001 gave Prime Minister Berlusconi strong support.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Then there is the ongoing conflict of interests between Berlusconi-the-Premier and Berlusconi-the-magnate, who holds public licenses that make him a semi-monopolist in media and TV advertising.</seg>
		<seg id="10">During Berlusconi's tenure in office, his enormous personal assets have tripled.</seg>
		<seg id="11">While his parliamentary majority has approved many laws that promote his personal interests and have eased some of his legal difficulties, at the beginning of March, Berlusconi was again accused of corruption and tax fraud.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Berlusconi's ministers have scarcely behaved better.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Two were forced to resign within a month of each other.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Roberto Calderoli, a prominent official in Lega Nord, the third-largest government party, provoked riots in Libya by wearing a t-shirt printed with the infamous cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Francesco Storace, the former Minister of Health and a leading member of Alleanza Nazionale, the second-largest government party, is suspected of organizing political espionage, in an Italian-style Watergate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But, despite the government's catastrophic economic and ethical record, opinion polls indicate a lead of only about four percentage points for l'Unione—too small, given the high number of undecided voters, to predict the election's outcome.</seg>
		<seg id="17">So what is keeping Berlusconi and his coalition in the race?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Above all, Berlusconi's electoral campaign is aimed, in the manner of President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign, at energizing his hard-core supporters and mobilizing the growing number of voters who have abstained in recent years.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In doing this he has not hesitated to use his semi-monopoly over television to exalt his government's alleged accomplishments.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His campaign rhetoric highlights anti-communism with an emphasis not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled with a defense of the family and values cherished by the Roman Catholic establishment, although the Church has so far resisted being drawn into the campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The Berlusconi coalition also benefits from the weakness of l'Unione.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Its leader, Romano Prodi, obtained an extraordinary popular endorsement when more than four million people voted for him in Italy's first-ever primary elections.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Yet Prodi continues to be a party-less leader of too many parties.</seg>
		<seg id="24">To be sure, the cohesiveness of l'Unione has strengthened: the two major parties (Democratici di Sinistra and Democrazia e Libertà - la Margherita) are united under the symbol of the olive tree, the other parties have endorsed a detailed 280-page government program, and the left-wing Partito della Rifondazione Comunista has given clear signs of moderation and loyalty to the coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="25">For voters, however, a perception of fragility remains.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Finally, the uncertainty of the outcome reflects not so much voters' behavior, but a change in the electoral system.</seg>
		<seg id="27">During the past decade, Italy has used a majority electoral system corrected by a proportional quota.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Under this system, Casa della Libertà translated a small popular majority in 2001 into a decisive parliamentary majority.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But, with the same result on the horizon this year for l'Unione, the center-right parliamentary majority changed the electoral law just a few months before the end of its term.</seg>
		<seg id="30">This is reminiscent of an army that, fearing defeat on the battlefield, poisons the wells as it retreats.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A proportional system in the absence of individual preferences means that party secretaries, rather than citizens, will choose deputies, and, with no effective electoral threshold, the number of parties will proliferate.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Although the election ballot will be 40 centimeters long to accommodate all the symbols of the old and new parties, it won't contain the name of even a single candidate.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But the worst problem is that the majority system for the Senate could lead to a different majority gaining control there than in the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house), which may well cause legislative paralysis.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Moreover, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's mandate ends at the same time that parliament dissolves, which means that his successor, elected by the new parliament, would have to nominate a government without a majority in both houses.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Berlusconi and Prodi have ruled out a German-style grand coalition -- an outcome that seems especially unlikely following an election campaign in which both contestants have strongly hinted that their opponent has no legitimate right to govern.</seg>
		<seg id="36">At the same time, holding another vote would leave the question of the electoral law unresolved.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The puzzle of Berlusconi's survival reflects a wider European conundrum.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Many Europeans, not just Italians, are nervous and unsure of where the continent is going.</seg>
		<seg id="39">So it is no surprise that an opportunist and charlatan like Berlusconi continues to get a hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Italians must decide upon the sort of Italy they want if they are to get leaders of the stature they need.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Transatlantic Blame Game</seg>
		<seg id="1">As if the diplomatic spat over Iraq weren't bad enough, relations between America and Europe are being slowly poisoned by divergent economic policies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Indeed, the differences between the two sides' economic strategies are as sharp as they have been in two decades.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At first glance, the depth of this ``policy gap'' seems surprising.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The economic outlook for the rest of this year and for 2004 has improved recently both in the US and Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Moreover, the US and Europe face a similar challenge: encouraging economic recovery.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But their governments' actions--or lack of action--make it seem as if neither side can see the problems faced by the other.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When the Euro was introduced, most EU members--Germany, in particular--looked forward to managing their economic policies with more autonomy and less US pressure.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Thus, today's framework in Euro area, with its unique mix of joint monetary policy and national responsibility for fiscal policy, was not constructed to facilitate macroeconomic coordination with the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the perception of many American observers was different.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They saw the central implication of the Euro as requiring Europe to junk its supposed role as a ``free rider'' in the international economy, one that left the US shouldering the burden of policy adjustments to promote global growth.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Europe would inevitably be forced to coordinate its policies with America.</seg>
		<seg id="12">These two views were bound to conflict, and now they do.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Tensions hidden during the long Clinton-era boom rose throughout 2001, when America tried to address its economic downturn by rapidly easing its monetary and fiscal policies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As big budget deficits returned, so did European skepticism about the sustainability of America's mounting external deficit and the overvalued dollar.</seg>
		<seg id="15">American critics, meanwhile, saw the Euro area as overly cautious for cutting interest rates slowly and maintaining the fiscal constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Initially, the Europeans underestimated the slowdown they confronted.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Subsequently, they were constrained by the limits to their fiscal reactions embodied in the Maastricht Treaty; the large economies of Continental Europe had not done enough budgetary consolidation during the years of good growth.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Both monetary and fiscal policies facilitated growth, but Europe did not help much to redress America's external imbalance.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Of course, the Euro area is so large a player that it can no longer leave responsibility for stimulating global growth to America.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But US efforts to encourage Europeans to adopt their pragmatic and discretionary approach to economic policy inevitably lead to frustration: the issues confronting the European economies are different from those facing the US--as are perceptions about the challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, the main reasons for the massive swing in US public finances--from surplus in 2000 to a deficit of more than 4% in 2003-04--have little to do with stabilization.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Aside from the costs of the Iraq war and other security concerns, along with lapses in earlier spending controls, US tax cuts have structural and distributional rather than short-term aims.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A short-term stimulus would not have bestowed the largest benefits upon the most affluent, whose spending is less sensitive to taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The cuts should sustain private demand this year and next, but at the cost of postponing improvements in private saving and indebtedness.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although the dollar has been depreciating for a year, continuing growth in domestic demand will likely push the current account deficit above 5% of GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="26">As the deficit widens further, dollar depreciation will likely resume, despite laggardly performances by the world's other major economies.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Will the US accept a prolonged slowdown after 2004, and could Europe make a greater contribution to global growth?</seg>
		<seg id="28">Probably not.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The counterpart to the US emphasis on self-reliance rather than direct public assistance is that employment must be maintained at high levels--regardless of the party in power--whereas most European countries have been prepared to accept unemployment rates of 8% or more.</seg>
		<seg id="30">So the US is likely to opt for growth.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Despite three years of weak growth, the gap between potential and actual output in Continental Europe's largest economies is currently smaller than in the US.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Income tax cuts to stimulate demand for labor and investment are desirable, given high rates in Europe's largest economies.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But tax cuts that must soon be reversed--due mainly to demographic pressure on public pensions and healthcare--are unlikely to stimulate demand as consumers lose confidence in government's ability to control deficits.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Europe needs structural reforms and tighter fiscal management, not inflation.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The EU countries are finally accelerating their implementation of structural reforms, but the starting point has become less favorable and political resistance too entrenched, as illustrated by the recent conflicts over reforms of French pensions and the German labor market.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Further dollar depreciation as well as slower US growth will undermine EU exports, the one relatively successful component of demand in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The divergence in policy and its time horizon will be papered over by the improved outlook for growth in both Europe and the US for the next year or so.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But the medium-term outlook is one of transatlantic confrontation, potentially as divisive as the disputes over the Iraq war.</seg>
		<seg id="39">If so, the ongoing Doha Round of international trade negotiations could be first to suffer.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Protectionism will be harder to resist on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The US cannot afford a continuing massive drain of demand through an external deficit, while complaints about loss of competitiveness will intensify in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It strains the imagination to think that the coming macroeconomic confrontation could subside quickly or quietly.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Multilateral Engagement for Energy Security</seg>
		<seg id="1">Our global need for energy reliability binds us together as surely as the global network that delivers it; a failure in one part of our network will inevitably affect everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Local interests and persistent conflicts that sit astride our networks, including the as yet unresolved issue of Russian gas supply to Ukraine and Europe, have again raised the specter of energy being used as a weapon to gain political leverage.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Energy security is at the top of the agenda of the G-8 meeting hosted by President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The G-8 has correctly identified the key economic issue, energy interdependence, and now is the time for focused multilateral engagement on this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For some countries that are blessed with vast supplies of oil and gas, the use of energy exports to reward friends and punish foes seems a tempting option.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Today, however, it is more likely to prove disruptive to friend and foe alike, as well as damaging to those countries that indulge this temptation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Energy embargoes have generally proven counterproductive.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The price rises that followed OPEC's oil embargoes of the 1970's were unsustainable and led to conservation efforts and expansion of non-OPEC production.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As a result, OPEC's share of world oil exports dropped sharply in the twelve years following the embargo of 1973-1974.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Experience has taught us that transparency and price stability is in everyone's interest.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Pursuit of these principals while encouraging the development of global markets is essential to greater overall growth prospects for the world economy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So when Russia sought earlier this year to quadruple the price of its gas exports to Ukraine, it argued that it was simply demanding market rates.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The message sounded fair and it did, for a short time, appeal to some policymakers and investors not fully apprised of the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">To be clear, measured price changes implemented over time was never in dispute; indeed, some internal price adjustments for Ukraine were in order.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Unfortunately for Russia's neighbors, it is not the market that determines what price is paid for Russia's gas or transport; it is Gazprom and its chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, who is also the Russian government's First Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The price charged by Gazprom for each country bordering Russia is different and is largely determined by political relationships with the Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Economically speaking, gas supply and transport prices are more correlated to political relationships than to fundamental supply-demand or gas transport basis calculations.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Ukraine was threatened with an immediate quadrupling of its prices -- or interruption of its gas supply - as a result of it new-found independence from Russia during the Orange Revolution.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Georgia, also feeling the wrath of Moscow following the Rose Revolution, faced potentially harmful price increases as well.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Belarus, however, still in strong alignment with the Kremlin, continues to enjoy highly subsidized gas.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course, Ukraine was not the only country put at risk by this brinksmanship; suppliers such as Turkmenistan, geographically locked into transit requirements through Russia, also suffer.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And for the consuming nations of Western and Central Europe, the price effects and supply disruption anxieties were of significant consequence.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Immediate multilateral intervention by the European Union and the United States probably are what probably caused Gazprom to turn the gas back on.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Natural gas may be the commodity most vulnerable to event-driven supply disruptions.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The fixed interconnected pipelines lock producers and consumers in a near-exclusive embrace.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Diversification in natural gas transportations is a long-term cross-border asset development proposition requiring enormous investment and political commitment on a multilateral level.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Many solutions are already under consideration: new gas storage capacity, increased efficiency, expansion of domestic production of both oil and gas, and alternative energy supplies such as coal-bed methane.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Additionally, a market in tradable liquefied natural gas (LNG) is rapidly emerging.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It is more feasible to diversify the supply chain, albeit incrementally, by importing gas from distant producers rather than from monopolistic suppliers next door.</seg>
		<seg id="30">All of these efforts together will soften shocks somewhat and create more energy self-sufficiency.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet more is required.</seg>
		<seg id="32">First, G-8 leaders should consider implementing standards in energy transactions requiring open and transparent contracts in line with best practices in business.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It is important to dilute the global impact of local politicians pursuing non‑energy agendas, or simply their own limited interests.</seg>
		<seg id="34">We see these problems today in state-owned firms in Latin America, political unrest in Africa, tensions in the Middle East or through opaque business intermediaries, as in the questionable gas deal between Ukraine and Russia, known now as RUE (RosUkrEnergo).</seg>
		<seg id="35">In the end, energy security for all of us in Europe requires recognizing that the linked nature of our supply and transmission systems makes us interdependent.</seg>
		<seg id="36">This is where an &quot;Energy Alliance&quot; of consumers and suppliers could be useful, starting with the nations of Europe helping to guarantee the energy supplies of others in a major disruption.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Energy Charter, which emphasizes market access and transparency, is a laudable effort but it is not sufficient for those moments of crisis; our markets are not yet well enough equipped to deal with event-driven disruptions.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The Energy Charter might be a vehicle for this collective energy security, if deepened and broadened.</seg>
		<seg id="39">It is our duty as leaders to chart a course for a secure energy future.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Tolerance of questionable dealing today for the sake of political expediency will cost more in the future for us all.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the inevitable conflict occurs, public confidence, political credibility and market reliability are needlessly sacrificed -- this has clearly occurred for Russia and for Ukraine.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Threats to energy security must be challenged and resolved on a multilateral basis, with all stakeholders present.</seg>
		<seg id="43">The interdependent nature of our energy infrastructure requires a multilateral approach.</seg>
		<seg id="44">We are all depending on it.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The Lebanon Proxy</seg>
		<seg id="1">Over the past few weeks, Lebanese politicians from groups as diverse as Hezbollah and the Christian Lebanese Forces have been meeting intermittently in what has been dubbed a &quot;National Dialogue.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">Their primary objective is to forge a consensus for Lebanon's future in the wake of the withdrawal of Syrian forces last year.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But what their dialogue has exposed is how much Lebanese politics continues to be shaped by external forces.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad retains huge influence over key levers of the Lebanese state, including the security and intelligence apparatus, the army, and the judiciary -- not to mention an alliance with the militarily powerful Hezbollah.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Though Syrian soldiers may have withdrawn a year ago, Assad's regime never got over its departure from Lebanon, and it seeks to re-impose some form of hegemony over the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Syria's stance is complicated by an ongoing United Nations investigation that accuses it of involvement in the February 14, 2005, assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.</seg>
		<seg id="7">While Syria's Lebanese allies have called for improved ties between the two countries, the Hariri murder makes this doubtful.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For the moment, the Lebanese parties have agreed not to allow their territory to be used as a base for any presumed threats to the Syrian regime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the same time, Egypt and Saudi Arabia want desperately to avoid the downfall of Assad's regime.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Publicly, they support the UN's investigation, but privately they have encouraged, even pressured, the Lebanese government to lower the heat on Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Lebanese adversaries of Syria have resisted such demands, but the Egyptian and Saudi stance highlights how, for reasons of self-interest, Arab regimes rarely like to see fellow despots fall.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Indeed, the Egyptian and Saudi attitude contrasts starkly with that of two Western powers with extensive influence in Lebanon, the United States and France, which support the UN inquiry wherever it might go.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Nevertheless, all four states agree that Syrian influence in Lebanon must be curbed, and all, in theory, approve of Hezbollah's disarmament -- required by UN Security Council resolution 1559 -- even if they differ over how to bring it about.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Another regional issue shaping Lebanese domestic politics is the ongoing violence between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Lebanon's Sunnis and Shiites -- the country's two most powerful communities, owing mostly to their demographic weight and the backing they enjoy from elsewhere in the region -- are nowhere near the point of mutual violence, but there has been palpable political tension recently.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Hariri was the leading Sunni politician, and after his murder both communities found themselves in opposing corners with respect to Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Within Lebanon, the Sunni-Shiite divide reflects broader regional frictions between the Sunni-majority Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, which backs Saad Hariri, the late prime minister's son, and Iran, which supports Hezbollah.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Saudis fear that Sunni-Shiite discord, spreading from Iraq across the Arab world, might harm the kingdom, whose Shiites are concentrated in the oil-rich eastern part of the country.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That is why Riyadh has encouraged Hariri to keep lines open to Hezbollah, the leading Shiite force.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Their sectarian anxieties aside, the Saudis and Egyptians fear that a nuclear Iran might secure Shiite dominance in the region.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Grafted onto this is America-Iranian enmity, fed by the nuclear issue, but also by disagreement in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The Arab states have found themselves uncomfortably caught in the middle, as have the Lebanese, who are alarmed that they may pay the price for any American or Israeli attack against Iran's nuclear facilities, because in either case, Hezbollah may retaliate against Israel from South Lebanon.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Inside Lebanon, Hezbollah has interpreted UN demands for its disarmament as a plot by the Bush administration to weaken the party, and as a means of affirming American supremacy in the region.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Hezbollah has refused to disarm in the face of what it has called the Israeli threat, although its definition of this threat has shifted frequently enough to cast doubt on whether it would ever be willing to surrender its weapons.</seg>
		<seg id="25">More recently, Hezbollah agreed to place the issue on the domestic negotiating agenda -- perhaps because Iran doesn't want it to be a source of national dissension -- but it is doubtful that genuine disarmament will ensue, at least for now.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Finally, as they maneuver around the shoals of regional and international affairs, the Lebanese must also consider domestic American politics.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Whatever one thinks about the war in Iraq, the US presence there has helped Lebanon to ward off Syrian efforts to reverse its withdrawal, as well as Arab efforts to compel the Lebanese to compromise with a regime that loathes Lebanese sovereignty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A US administration in full withdrawal from Iraq would likely become indifferent to what happens in Lebanon.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Who but Syria and Iran would benefit from that?</seg>
		<seg id="30">Such an outcome might satisfy some parts of Lebanese society, particularly Hezbollah.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But most Lebanese remain committed to seeing their country living in peace, free from the isolation and militancy that are the hallmarks of Iran and Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Unfortunately, Lebanon has always been buffeted by its surroundings, and the country could once again become an arena for destructive regional conflicts, regardless of what the Lebanese prefer.</seg>

		<seg id="3">According to Bush, the plan would tackle the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Namely, by doing this they want to calm investors prior to trading on the Asian financial markets, which, given their time zones, are the first ones where the decision by Congress could influence Monday's trading.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Razor's edge battle: MP3 players vs. cell phones.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Our advice on how to choose</seg>
		<seg id="2">While nearly every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This makes it seem clear that it is better to only buy a phone.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In spite of this, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future owner.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It is not likely that you will get a top-of-the-line expensive record player in order to listen to the newest album by Maxim Turbulenc.</seg>
		<seg id="7">First of all such music products not available on LPs, but also, from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if your shelves are crowded with art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl records, you are likely at least dreaming of a record player like that.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It's the same with music on trips, that is, compressed music, simply put, MP3 music.</seg>
		<seg id="10">There are price and qualitative categories here as well.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For some, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on an MP3 player, just as it is hard for Pink Floyd fan to accept twenty-crown headphones from a market hall.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The selection is broad.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Battery life also decides.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than merely play music, but also what most cell phones can't even do by chance.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No contemporary machine is as universal as the telephone.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, contains a camera which is sometimes better and sometimes worse and can even navigate in some cases.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And when we take smart phones and communication devices, you have a small computer in your pocket.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It's a small miracle, as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The universal nature of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Very few cell phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, most of them much less.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In this way, music players (particularly the simplest ones) are much more efficient.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not play for more than a few hours.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If you occasionally make calls in addition to that, to be on the safe side, get another charger for your workplace - even for more expensive devices.</seg>
		<seg id="27">You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours running on one charge.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Another problem arises when recording music on the cell phone.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Unfortunately, only a limited percentage of the devices contain a universal USB connector, and on top of that, not every one of those can be directly connected to a computer without special software.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Of course, music can be recorded directly onto a memory card, but very few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in the cell phones without an adaptor.</seg>
		<seg id="31">For the music players, with some exceptions (iPod), you don't need any special software.</seg>
		<seg id="32">It's enough to fill the device with music using the USB from the computer.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Most cell phones and music players already create a music library by themselves, organized according to the artist's name, album title, genre, or, e.g., user rating.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Some devices only display the tree structure of the directory, similar to Windows Explorer and some are able to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with an operating systems).</seg>
		<seg id="35">Music players easier to service, cell phones can do more</seg>
		<seg id="36">In choosing specific equipment, you should be interested above all in the life of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of the audio output, and of course also the user-friendly nature of the operation.</seg>
		<seg id="37">If music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only going to listen to it for a little while, perhaps in the tram, any cell phone which plays MP3 is enough.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Which almost any cell phone is truly able to do.</seg>
		<seg id="39">You don't even have to pay too much attention to which music formats the cell phone or music player can handle.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The MP3 can handle all of them, and in fact, most of the music you will get will be in this very format.</seg>
		<seg id="41">It one of the most widespread formats and in addition to it, the absolute majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Less common is the appearance of AAC (the format used by the Apple company and its iPods).</seg>
		<seg id="43">Better cell phones, at the same time, enable the purchase of music on-line.</seg>
		<seg id="44">All you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator (or another provider) using mobile Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="45">This service by itself could be a substantial reason for obtaining a music cell phone.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Unfortunately the offerings from the operators are paltry and are usually limited to fast-growing radio hits.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The prices are also not among the lowest.</seg>
		<seg id="48">It is generally assumed, however, that this very manner of music sales (whether using GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will take over the music industry in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Most people have their cell phone on them at all times.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Whenever you feel like listening to something, you can reach for your cell phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies at home, forgotten.</seg>
		<seg id="51">However, it still depends on whether you always have headphones or at least the wire hands-free with you.</seg>
		<seg id="52">If not, you can utilize the integrated speaker that is in almost all cell phones, but only in a minimum of MP3 players.</seg>
		<seg id="53">But the greatest advantage of the music cell phones for many people is the price.</seg>
		<seg id="54">The least expensive of them regularly cost less than three thousand crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="55">For three or four thousand crowns, you can get a very decent walkman.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Usually, however, you'll be limited by the absence of output on ordinary headphones.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The best and most technically well-equipped telephones, with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="58">The advantage of the music players, on the other hand, is, among other reasons, that they are easy to operate.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive (see our selection) - music players.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The minimum of functions and similarity in operation to the formerly common cassette recorder or even the record player is apparent.</seg>
		<seg id="61">There is no threat of a clash in the form of mobile Internet turned on by accident and the resulting enormous bill for data transmission.</seg>
		<seg id="62">What device to reach for</seg>
		<seg id="63">Even the least expensive cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for replaceable memory cards (of the type M2, microSD and the like).</seg>
		<seg id="64">Even with the additional purchase of the respective card, you will spend less than two thousand crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Be careful, however.</seg>
		<seg id="66">With the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB tend to be supported.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Only the most expensive ones can also handle 8 GB memory cards.</seg>
		<seg id="68">If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.</seg>
		<seg id="69">Based on capacity (maximum 2 GB) you don't have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If you are a more demanding listener, reach instead for specialized cell phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung models).</seg>
		<seg id="71">These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the user-friendly nature of their operation is close to that of a separate MP3 player.</seg>
		<seg id="72">Sony Ericsson, whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately, is the most advanced in the field.</seg>
		<seg id="73">The MP3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery endurance (normally 15 hours, maximally up to 35 hours).</seg>

		<seg id="0">First virtual operator to arrive in Czechia this year.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Maybe</seg>
		<seg id="2">The mobile market in Czechia is quite advanced and local operators offer practically all the same services as their partners in Western Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In spite of this, there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the classic operators to lower their prices.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It might be missing for a long time.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This has also been confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Bureau, who called attention to the fact that the price of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the Union.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Following the most recent steps taken by the European Commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees, a paradoxical situation may occur - text messages for some customers of Czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home.</seg>
		<seg id="8">How is it possible that the prices in Czechia remain so high in comparison with Europe?</seg>
		<seg id="9">The answer is simple, there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks here and over 100% coverage.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to pretend that the Czech market is extremely competitive.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This is often seconded by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Bureau (CTB) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for another operator in Czechia.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It is probably true that a classical operator with its own network no longer has much chance (for that matter, it would be very difficult to find frequencies).</seg>
		<seg id="14">But there is one more opportunity - a virtual operator.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the significant lowering of prices, to which even the classic operators had to react.</seg>
		<seg id="16">At the same time, even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those here could be heard.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly successful.</seg>
		<seg id="18">For that matter, we don't have to go far to find examples.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In February of this year, we informed you of the start of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Over the course of merely half a year, this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator.</seg>
		<seg id="21">At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns, among others, U:fon, stands behind Mobilking.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more specific target group.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In order to function effectively, they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does.</seg>
		<seg id="24">That is, they do not carry the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In this way, virtual operators around the world usually profile themselves as low-cost - they offer inexpensive calling and text messages, which is often balanced out by a more limited offer of services, though.</seg>
		<seg id="26">That's how, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its competitors.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel target group.</seg>
		<seg id="28">That is, this operator is specifically oriented toward men.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Real men choose Mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust,&quot; says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which runs this virtual operator.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in Poland could catch on here.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual operators are founded.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In addition, it's relatively saturated from the perspective of the offer of services.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">No chance in Czechia, say mobile operators</seg>
		<seg id="34">It seems almost certain that if there is to be a virtual operator in Czechia, it won't be Mobilking.</seg>
		<seg id="35">&quot;We have been talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in Czechia don't look very hopeful.</seg>
		<seg id="36">More likely, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region,&quot; said Jana Studničková, speaker for the Penta financial group, in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.</seg>
		<seg id="37">She also confirmed indirectly that the current mobile operators in Czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Rather, on the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence.</seg>
		<seg id="39">For a longer period of time now, the GTS Novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator, and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a real competitor of Telefonica O2 in the area of corporate clientele.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services, but also mobile ones.</seg>
		<seg id="41">The sooner, the better.</seg>
		<seg id="42">We have held repeated negotiations on this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.</seg>
		<seg id="43">We have already been able to make progress in the negotiations with some of them,&quot; said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Perhaps there are better times ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="45">On the basis of unofficial information, it looks like we can expect the first virtual operator as early as the end of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="46">In the meantime, however, its creation is accompanied by a wall of silence.</seg>
		<seg id="47">&quot;At this time, we do not think that there is space for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Compared to other markets, the Czech market is very specific.</seg>
		<seg id="49">No subject has approached us thus far with a complex and serious project in this area,&quot; claimed Vlastimil Sršeň from the public relations department of Telefonica 02 in a statement for Mobil.cz.</seg>
		<seg id="50">Other operators also refer to the specific nature of the Czech market.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a rare shared opinion with a statement by O2, T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová added: &quot;We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous business project that it would be possible to build upon.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="52">And she added: &quot;No virtual operator is likely to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="53">At this moment, in order to be talking about such a short timeframe, we would already have to have a concrete agreement on the table.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="54">Vodafone is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Regarding this, Miroslav Čepický said: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, above all in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.</seg>
		<seg id="56">From the perspective of the customers, we consider this to be the most beneficial.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a shared network for fast mobile Internet.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="58">Responsible authorities - buddy-buddy with operators</seg>
		<seg id="59">The procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand, the entrance of another operator would mean increased competition, it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Why, then, make this entrance easy for such a competitor?</seg>
		<seg id="61">The tug-of-war surrounding the creation of U:fon attests to the fact that when something is important to the operators, they are able to pull for the same team.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Probably the greatest pressure on the Czech Telecommunication Office was during the time of the creation of U:fon by T-Mobile.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Information publicly available from the Czech Telecommunication Office's web pages attests to this.</seg>
		<seg id="64">But now this is a suitable argument for U:fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual operator.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Regarding that matter, Martina Kemrová pointed out: &quot;The competitive environment of the mobile market was also recently amplified by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Considering the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="67">But considering this approach by the mobile operators, the lack of interest by the Czech regulatory organs is, in fact, startling.</seg>
		<seg id="68">This means not only the attitude of the CTO, which unfortunately in Czechia - unlike in Great Britain and other developed countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition.</seg>
		<seg id="69">This authority belongs to the Office for the Protection of Competition (OPC) exclusively.</seg>
		<seg id="70">But this office has assumed its typical position on this whole issue.</seg>
		<seg id="71">&quot;The entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.</seg>
		<seg id="72">No such contract has ever been signed, because the supply of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators,&quot; claimed Kristián Chalupa from the external relations department of the OPC in his answer to our question.</seg>
		<seg id="73">A statement formulated in that way by representatives of the operators probably won't surprise anyone.</seg>
		<seg id="74">From the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses his/her position on the market, it is more than serious.</seg>
		<seg id="75">All the more so when Kristián Chalupa added: &quot;In other countries, where virtual operators commonly function, we can observe that their entrance on the market contributed to the decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="76">But evidently the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the OPC.</seg>
		<seg id="77">In truth, the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile operators that is implicit in their reactions.</seg>
		<seg id="78">The question as to whether this is really just a coincidence arises entirely by itself.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Just like the exact same price of gasoline at the gas stations is surely just the product of coincidence and the tough competitive battle.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;The Office did not find any signs of actions violating the rules of competition, and thus has no reason to intervene in any way.</seg>
		<seg id="81">None of the operators have a dominant position, and hence none of them have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.</seg>
		<seg id="82">The telecommunications regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to open the mobile market for the virtual operators,&quot; Chalupa claimed in his statement.</seg>
		<seg id="83">The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the disputed points.</seg>
		<seg id="84">Of course, an analysis of the relevant markets does exist, conducted by CTO, according to which telecommunications are, from the perspective of competition, the only market.</seg>
		<seg id="85">On such a market, none of the Czech operators then have a dominant position.</seg>
		<seg id="86">But some legal experts offer a different perspective - in order to create a virtual operator, it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator.</seg>
		<seg id="87">And the mobile operator - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network.</seg>
		<seg id="88">So in a certain segment, it must necessarily be dominant.</seg>
		<seg id="89">But even if we did not consider this argument, for the OPC it could be at least alarming that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner.</seg>
		<seg id="90">At the same time, complaints from a series of interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) demonstrate that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators.</seg>
		<seg id="91">Placing the responsibility on the CTO is a rather common trick in telecommunications, through which the OPC can have nothing to do with the whole matter.</seg>
		<seg id="92">We have already encountered it in several similar cases.</seg>
		<seg id="93">Unfortunately, it was not possible to establish the extension of the CTO's authority to the area of competition in telecommunications in the recently approved amendment to the Telecommunications Act, even though many experts had expected that this would improve the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="94">The representatives of the OPC must know this very well, but their interests are evidently elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="95">It can be done when nobody's looking</seg>
		<seg id="96">At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are already several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.</seg>
		<seg id="97">These are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, which are only partially public.</seg>
		<seg id="98">These are usually companies dealing with multilevel marketing.</seg>
		<seg id="99">For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile telephone services.</seg>
		<seg id="100">The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="101">The trick lies in the fact that, in relation to the operator, the company acts like a classic company client who orders a great amount of SIM cards.</seg>
		<seg id="102">As a significant client, it then gets special price offers (and other types of offers).</seg>
		<seg id="103">The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance sales.</seg>
		<seg id="104">&quot;If the cases you are talking about were to occur, this could be a violation of the contract conditions, which we would investigate, and it could culminate in the termination of our cooperation with the given company,&quot; Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.</seg>
		<seg id="105">But it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the responsible people from the mobile operators.</seg>
		<seg id="106">This could be a question of thousands of customers, above all in the case of the three companies mentioned above.</seg>
		<seg id="107">But at the same time, none of the operators are opposed to such a procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="108">Namely, they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing.</seg>
		<seg id="109">Miroslav Čepický draws attention to potential problems: &quot;The law enables such speculation, nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies.</seg>
		<seg id="110">On top of that, they must accept that the SIM card in their telephone is not registered under their name, and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="111">This is precisely what should seem at least strange to the CTO.</seg>
		<seg id="112">In addition, another question for the OPC arises.</seg>
		<seg id="113">If the mobile operators are looking the other way concerning this procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?</seg>
		<seg id="114">It must be added that the OPC has rather considerable power to uncover such activities, and if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with operators' claims that they have no idea about any such thing and that their trading conditions prohibit it.</seg>
		<seg id="115">When we won't be the most expensive</seg>
		<seg id="116">As mentioned already several times in this article, the entrance of the virtual operators onto the mobile market was brought about by a notable drop in the prices of services.</seg>
		<seg id="117">At the same time, classical operators have more or less tried to prevent the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created.</seg>
		<seg id="118">The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small, too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="119">But in developed countries, the regulatory organs, which supported the interests not of the mobile operators, but of their customers, intervened at that very moment.</seg>
		<seg id="120">Either through formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator, and others continued in its footsteps.</seg>
		<seg id="121">Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato.</seg>
		<seg id="122">Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that the lack of clarity in competencies in these cases suits them very well.</seg>
		<seg id="123">But let's not throw in the towel.</seg>
		<seg id="124">If the behind-the-scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon, the Czech mobile market might be set in motion once again.</seg>
		<seg id="125">If one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for OPC to be able to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of further interested parties.</seg>
		<seg id="126">And we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of Europe.</seg>

		<seg id="3">On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my Country) on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The anthem was newly recorded by the National Theater Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Four versions are available - versions with male or female solo vocals, a choral version and an instrumental version.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka did the singing.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.</seg>
		<seg id="8">You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful national anthems.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He told Czech Radio earlier that he had intentionally selected singers with young, representative voices that were striking and popular for the solo variants.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;From the beginning, with both of them and also with the chorus, I tried to make sure that they had clear articulation, so that the text could be understood well, so that they were in harmony,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written into the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first travellers board the metro, trams and buses with an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The roughly one hundred thousand people in possession of their own chip card Opencard at this time can get this coupon.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Travellers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and year-long coupon (which will be valid beginning on January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Beginning yesterday, coupons can also be purchased over the Internet on the web pages of the Transport Company, www.dpp.cz.</seg>
		<seg id="5">By the afternoon, more than four hundred customers had used the service.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Those beginning to use Internet shopping can definitively forget about the vending windows in the metro stations, where up to now they have had to regularly stand in long lines for paper tickets.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That is, they can buy the coupon over the Internet and it will be added to the Opencard at one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;At these locations, there is a counter available for travellers with trained staff who will help interested people with their Internet purchase, and will also add the purchased coupon to their card,&quot; said the project's speaker, Martin Opatrný.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to add the electronic coupons to the Opencard at the self-service machines which have been set up in several vestibules of the metro.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What do these self-service machines look like?</seg>
		<seg id="11">They are red, resembling ticket validation machines, and travellers might have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them,&quot; Opatrný added.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Coupon checked by self-service machine instead of driver</seg>
		<seg id="14">Using the self-service machines, which will begin functioning tomorrow, is simple.</seg>
		<seg id="15">All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card, and the pre-paid card is automatically added to it.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The electronic coupons are valid beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city, but in its surroundings as well.</seg>
		<seg id="17">That is, in suburban trains and bus lines numbered 300 to 499, which are mainly used by inhabitants of Central Bohemian towns to travel into the capital city.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;In trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they can check the time and zone validity of the coupons,&quot; Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which creates the timetables of the Prague Mass Transport, explained the ticket-checking procedures.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register next to the driver's seat.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Upon boarding, it is thus necessary to not only show the chip card to the driver, but in addition it is necessary to place the Opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons recorded.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;If the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons recorded, there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver,&quot; Drápal added.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Travelers who do not use suburban buses, and will not remember when the validity of a coupon ends, can head again for the self-service machines where the coupons are added to the card.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Here the information on the validity of their documents will appear on the machine's screen.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Sudeten Germans requested that the Šumava region be incorporated into the United States in 1945.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is implicit in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Research Library.</seg>
		<seg id="3">If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, we wish at least to live under the patronage of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Several groups of Sudeten Germans supposedly addressed the president of the USA with a wish of this type.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This arises from, among other things, a letter which has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemia Research Library.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov request that the American president not to allow the return of the &quot;Šumava region&quot; - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the American troops are entering German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but rather, as liberators,&quot; is what is written in the letter, signed &quot;People who are not indifferent to the fate of Šumava&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since the annexation by Czechoslovakia supposedly only gives the Sudeten Germans hope for - knowing the Czech national character - brutality, disregard, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate of Šumava forever.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would award this territory to a state foreign to us, which oppresses and oppugns minorities and which has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allies,&quot; is written in the letter.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The reason why the authors could not sign their names was the supposed fear of revenge by the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">If the president of the USA were to supposedly have doubts about the persuasion of the Šumava Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the Šumava region on whether its inhabitants want to become a part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Though the text of the letter may sound a bit naïve given the contemporary knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately sketches the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even though the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that their displacement from the country would be discussed, almost none of them admitted this possibility at all.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a certain type of autonomy for the Sudetenlands.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The famous journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, also confirms this.</seg>
		<seg id="17">As a German from České Budějovice, he was sent to the navy in the Baltic Sea during the war.</seg>
		<seg id="18">When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, tens of other Czech Germans went to him so that he would teach them Czech.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;They believed that when they returned home, Czech would come in handy,&quot; Chalupa said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war envisaged being displaced from the republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Emotive campaign attacks drivers</seg>
		<seg id="2">The most expensive action aimed at safety on the roads in Czech history.</seg>
		<seg id="3">That's also one way to characterize the emotive media campaign which the Ministry of Transportation plans to launch on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The office of minister Aleš Řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The 150-million-crown campaign will appear on television, on the radio, in cinemas, on the Internet, but also on flyers.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It should discourage drivers from speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they start driving.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Above all, it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and last but not least, professional drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And what appears in the spots?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mainly human stories that attack the emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And even the &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the whole campaign attests to this:</seg>
		<seg id="12">You don't think - you pay!</seg>
		<seg id="13">The words &quot;you don't think&quot; are written in capital letters on a license plate.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then the words &quot;you pay&quot; are in a pool of blood.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his/her own life.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The spots will &quot;haunt&quot; the viewers until 2010.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The ministry found inspiration in similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It hopes that the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads will thus decrease.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Sugar and whip for drivers</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;The drivers are influenced by the sugar and whip system.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The sugar for them is, for example, when they run a red light, they save time.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the risk,&quot; says Martin Kořán, a transportation psychologist from Na Homolce Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="25">And that's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist believes.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Less effective in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers' attention to the danger.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;If a static table which warns against danger is installed, it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it,&quot; Kořán warned.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The prime minister of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, expressed his opinion in favour of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967, that is, even Transjordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and with Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="2">He did this in an interview which was printed by the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Monday.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all of the (occupied) territories, if not all of them,&quot; Olmert told the newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similar percentage (of Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace if we don't do that,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He admitted that the possible restitution would also include East Jerusalem.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Whoever wants to be safe in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs, like what happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert noted in reference to two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and tens injured.</seg>
		<seg id="7">According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a &quot;special solution for the Temple Mount, a sacred and historic place&quot;, which lies inside the Old City.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;Whoever will want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.</seg>

		<seg id="11">Olmert also expressed his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with Syria.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But that would also require certain effort from Damascus.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;I am not proposing to agree on peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights,&quot; he warned.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;The Syrians know well what they will have to give up in order to gain the Golan Heights.</seg>
		<seg id="15">They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to the (Shi-ite movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the ongoing support they provide to the terrorism of the (Shi-ite movement) Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and the jihad (holy war) in Iraq,&quot; the prime minister specified.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Questions after accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Law doesn't know them, walking in coach bus not permitted</seg>
		<seg id="2">In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;If we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law, the activities of the steward are in conflict with the Traffic Law,&quot; says speaker for the Ministry of Transportation Karel Hanzelka.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The accident, during which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Unluckily, at that moment, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the vehicle, even though there are two more seats reserved for her.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, the bus can crash or brake sharply even when the steward is handing out coffee or newspapers.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The question of whether the bus is equipped with standing room in accordance with its registration plays a role.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If this is not approved in the bus, the passengers must sit.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Student Agency coach buses do not have standing room; which the head of the company, Radim Jančura, also confirmed for Aktuálně.cz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and initially they did not permit the movement of the passengers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat,&quot; he conveyed his position.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The law does not know the steward</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;There is no straightforward legal interpretation of the steward - no legal enactments deal with this role.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, nor do any legal enactments prohibit the transporters from providing services.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Traffic Law only knows the term vehicle conductor; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person,&quot; speaker Hanzelka added less unambiguously.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The head of the Department of Motor Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transportation, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, said that the law treats this issue sufficiently.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;It depends on whether the bus has standing room permitted in its certification.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That's all there is to it,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Buses are divided into the categories of city bus, where there is standing room and limited maximum speed, inter-city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted, and coach buses, with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Like in an airplane, says expert</seg>
		<seg id="21">Jaroslav Hořín, an expert on traffic safety for the National Strategy for Traffic Safety (BESIP), does not see any essential problem in the movement of stewards on the buses.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;During a smooth ride, there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Even there it is not certain when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit her head.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;However, if the bus were to brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics are valid.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Just like in a city bus or a tram.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations,&quot; he says, and he also thinks that from the legal perspective, this issue is unresolved.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Jančura willing to discontinue services</seg>
		<seg id="28">Student Agency is the only bus transport provider to offer the steward service.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It employs nearly two hundred of them.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Even after the accident, the head does not consider their job to be risky.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;But as soon as I gain the impression that the stewards' job is risky, I will discontinue them.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Passengers can get coffee and newspapers when boarding.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It would also save costs,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Alexej Litvin, head of Asiana, which operates a fraction of the bus lines that SA does, explained the absence of stewards in his vehicles as due to safety interests.</seg>
		<seg id="35">&quot;We don't have stewardesses, we've been against it from the very beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident,&quot; he told Týden.cz nearly a year ago.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Enormous tragedy occurred</seg>
		<seg id="38">A young stewardess from the Pilsen area, who had worked for the company for two years, died in an accident on the bus line to Naples.</seg>
		<seg id="39">A Slovenian tractor trailer truck likely left the emergency lane without signalling and blocked the path of the bus.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The bus driver tried to avoid it using a sharp manoeuvre, however, the front right part of the bus grazed it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Jančura rebuffs the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest had been sold out.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;It is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses, they are blocked.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="43">The company plans to sue the driver of the truck.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl's family, but it expects financial compensation from the guilty party.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Adaptation of the law?</seg>
		<seg id="46">Far away</seg>
		<seg id="47">An adaptation of the law, on which a thirty-member expert group from the Ministry of Transportation has been working for over a year, could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses.</seg>
		<seg id="48">&quot;But no concrete conclusion has been reached.</seg>
		<seg id="49">They are not dealing with buses much, it is more the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving,&quot; says expert Hořín.</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;The Ministry of Transportation does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would threaten the safety of the passengers in any essential way,&quot; concludes speaker Hanzelka, adding that the enforcement of safety in buses is under the jurisdiction of the police and the Labor Safety Office.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In a letter from the WestLB board of directors to the bank's employees, grand talk is not in short supply.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Combining units of the Duesseldorf institution with Frankfurt's Deka Bank, the notice made public on Monday claims, could `create a major capital-market institution of the Sparkassen Finanzgruppe.'</seg>
		<seg id="3">WestLB would contribute to the deal a `bloc of expertise' with sustained earning power, it says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Generally, the letter suggests, this kind of jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for further concentration in the area of the German state banks, the Landesbanken.</seg>
		<seg id="5">That's what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to demonstrate being on top of things in difficult times.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The flagging WestLB is still exposed to tremendous pressure, after all.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Not just from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which only recently warned the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there was an urgent need for a solution.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But talks of some type of jointer between Deka Bank, which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment funds, and WestLB have been making the rounds for some time now - even in Frankfurt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Presenting the report on the first two quarters in late August, Deka Bank head Franz Waas said a fusion between the institute on Mainzer Landstrasse and a Landesbank, such as Hesse and Thuringia's Helaba or WestLB, made little sense to him.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But the administrative board of Deka, which is owned in equal parts by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has asked the board of directors to commence talks with WestLB on joint business ventures.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The possible subject is the capital-market business, or parts of it.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Of course, as sources in the financial community point out, negotiations have only just begun.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It's not the first time that the name Deka Bank - with its staff of 3000 one of the more significant employers in the financial center of Frankfurt - crops up in the context of a savings banks consolidation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In 2003, a merger of Deka Bank with Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba briefly seemed to be within the realm of possibility.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But in the end, the threesome didn't happen.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As soon as the plans became public, the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The two remaining institutions also proved unable to reach an agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Instead, Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was bought by Stuttgart's Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But deliberations on a jointer between Deka Bank and Landesbanken have continued to rear their heads.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Most recently, Guenther Merl, chairman of the board at Helaba, had quelled considerations of a merger with his institution.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This aside, there seems to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative.</seg>
		<seg id="22">First up, now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, a jointer between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg may have become more likely.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Should the pressure for more mergers increase, it will by degrees be running out of potential partners.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In the South, it would merely be a junior partner, although it has to date weathered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in Munich and Stuttgart.</seg>
		<seg id="26">A merger with WestLB, in turn, was squashed early this year by the Savings Bank Association of Hesse and Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Remains only NordLB.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the equation.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other stands the question in how far the institutions' different business models are compatible with another.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate business model to ensure the sustainability of the Landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the German Savings Bank Association.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Ultimately, WestLB might also be split up, although, of course, that's not a solution favored at WestLB.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The letter from its board of directors, accordingly, voices the manifest desire for a `comprehensive solution.'</seg>
		<seg id="33">Quite how this is reconcilable with a jointer between individual units of WestLB and Deka Bank remains to be seen.</seg>

		<seg id="5">They came to Verona from Bologna.</seg>

		<seg id="7">Three buses are reserved for Italians mainly, one is exclusively for Brazilians.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag. They were celebrating last night already.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And very loudly, too, says Marco Guarda - too loudly for Italians.</seg>

		<seg id="0">No Sleep for Hypo Real Estate Creditors</seg>
		<seg id="1">As recently as last week, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stressed that the banking system of Germany was relatively stable.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It's a good thing that the politician used the term `relatively,' further interjecting that the German banking sector wouldn't be spared by the crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Because that's what happened this weekend.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The real-estate bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) from Munich, which is listed in the DAX stock index, is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of German banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences.</seg>
		<seg id="5">An individual close to the proceedings told Reuters on Monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion Euros total.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Hypo Real Estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using, they said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The money was coming from private as well as public banks, they added.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The news comes in the wake of losses at subsidiary Depfa.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to a news report, the government-funding bank had refinanced long-term projects it was financing on very short notice - which, due to the mistrust at the markets, is no longer a possibility.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In the first half-year of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 Euros, with the capital resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year, while earnings from write-ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of accruals from credit transactions had shrunk by more than 70 percent to 5 million Euros.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former Depfa Group, as well as from refunds of interest according to the Fiscal Code and from agency for group companies.</seg>
		<seg id="13">After going private in 1990, the former government-funding bank had initially incurred speculation losses through commercial real-esate credits, which were then outsourced to Aareal Bank.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Because earnings in classical government-funding were slim, Depfa had diversified internationally, increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of joint ventures between private investors and the government (Public-Private Partnership, PPP).</seg>
		<seg id="15">Now Hypo Real Estate has to induce write-offs according to the subsidiary's worth that will have a `significant, material effect' on the group's profit-and-loss statement, it said rather vaguely.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As a matter of fact, the dividend has been omitted.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It had already been reduced by two thirds in 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Because it does not have client deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks.</seg>
		<seg id="20">With the collapse two weeks ago of American investment bank Lehman Brothers, the extension of loans among banks has largely dried up again, because banks are hoarding their assets.</seg>
		<seg id="21">For part of Depfa's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion Euros - Hypo Real Estate annually requires short-term capital for refinancing.</seg>
		<seg id="22">According to Hypo Real Estate, the credits meet the group's financing requirements for the foreseeable future, shielding the corporation from `the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets.'</seg>
		<seg id="23">Other sources say that, thanks to the credits, refinancing is covered until late 2009.</seg>
		<seg id="24">HRE chairman of the board Georg Funke said that, in the foreseeable future, the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again, however.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The Deutsche Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) are now considering the Hypo Real Estate Group's marketability to be secured.</seg>
		<seg id="26">On behalf of the bank's shareholders and creditors, it is to be hoped they are right.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But given the dynamics and the unpredictability of the crisis, things are likely to remain uncertain.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It's not even unthinkable that not all of the financing will be needed.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The opposite cannot be discounted either, however.</seg>
		<seg id="30">After the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late Sunday night, even a bailout, temporary as it is, is incapable of easing people's minds.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The price per share is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 Euros.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bond prices are holding up reasonably well, meanwhile.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Whereas senior debts are hardly moving, junior bonds are dropping more significantly.</seg>
		<seg id="34">This mainly applies to bonds of former subsidiary Wuerttemberg Hypo and, understandably, to repayment periods beyond 2009.</seg>
		<seg id="35">To date, Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment. After the financial crisis, as well as the bank's own homemade crisis caused by the acquisition of Depfa, however, their recoverability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.</seg>
		<seg id="36">As long as central banks, governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to support the system, bond settlement deadlines can be met.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Alternatively, that which nobody dares to hope for yet right now comes to pass, and the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But considering that one report of partial nationalization is chasing the next, a probability bordering on certainty has now shrunk to a valid hope.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This may be causing some sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular, as they ponder the question whether or not to abandon their exposure.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Short-term investors may at least use the line that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss carry-forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come.</seg>

		<seg id="1">When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is asked to introduce herself on her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls begin to giggle: The German girl is totally `kawaii'!</seg>
		<seg id="2">What this means?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Sylvana is familiar with the term from reading manga - in her new exchange log she tells about Japan.</seg>
		<seg id="4">`First day at school in Japan.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I was so excited.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The way to school alone gave me the jitters.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I live at the edge of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and the train ride to Tachibana High School is 40 minutes.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I had to find the way on my own, and luckily I didn't get lost.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The beginning of class isn't organized as strictly as back home in Lower Saxony.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Students begin trickling in at eight o'clock, until a brief conference with the teacher, the `home room,' starts at 8:40.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But before class began, it was my turn to introduce myself.</seg>
		<seg id="12">I'm not someone who likes to talk in front of other people, mind you, let alone a class of 40.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I was dressed in one of my host mother's old skirts, as well as a blouse, blue stockings and black leather shoes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In this attire, I stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is a week from now.</seg>
		<seg id="15">At that moment, I was very glad that I'd been learning the language for two years already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The 31 girls in class were all whispering and giggling among themselves and waving at me, and I kept hearing the word `kawaii.'</seg>
		<seg id="17">I already knew it from my manga.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It's part of the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means `cute,' `sweet.'</seg>
		<seg id="19">Then I scurried to my seat.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The girl beside me was smiling rather brightly. She thought it was an honor that the exchange student should be seated next to her.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The rest of class was pretty uneventful, but when the bell rang, they were all practically crowding me.</seg>
		<seg id="22">They were talking all at once and giggled and bombarded me with one question after another, even though Japanese English is really hard to understand.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Then, during the break, everybody got out their bentos.</seg>
		<seg id="24">My host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me, too - it's something else than the bleak German lunch break sandwiches.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad made from cucumber and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Most of the time I don't have the first clue what I'm eating here in Japan.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The stuff looks weird and has a completely novel taste.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I can say this: It's all delicious.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Well, except for the salty plums in oil, that is. Yeuch!</seg>
		<seg id="30">At Japanese schools, the bentos aren't just lunch.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a homemade bento that she's fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy, in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break.</seg>
		<seg id="32">I read about that in my manga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I'm looking forward to finding out whether that's happening here, too.</seg>
		<seg id="34">`Why Japan, of all places?,' my girlfriends asked when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.</seg>
		<seg id="35">And I always told them:</seg>
		<seg id="36">`Because it happens to fascinate me.'</seg>
		<seg id="37">After all, manga have been my favorite reading material for years.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And in order to have a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them, I eventually started to learn a little Japanese, as well.</seg>
		<seg id="39">So for me it's been a no-brainer that I would have to come here eventually.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Because I also have a penchant for tradition, manners and customs.</seg>
		<seg id="41">And those are considered very important here.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On the one hand, Japan is the land of the latest technologies and trends, but on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.</seg>
		<seg id="43">And because everything is so well-organized, I haven't felt lost yet, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Rats Have Feelings, Too</seg>
		<seg id="1">When in danger, a rat or roach will run away. Does it mean they experience fear, too?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings, as well.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But if they act the same way we do, how could it be determined whether they also experience the same feelings?</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Internet magazine `Edge' has been running pieces by famous scientists for years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a series, SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a selection of responses to the question, `What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?'</seg>
		<seg id="6">I believe that animals have feelings, as well as other modes of awareness, although neither I nor anybody else have been able to prove it to date. For that matter, we haven't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But in that case, we can at least hope, since all human brains possess the same basic configuration.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in general, however, we are entering difficult terrain, because the hardware is not compatible.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: It plays possum, runs away or attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Humans behave similarly, which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is comparable.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But I don't believe that.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There are two aspects of our brain structure that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For one thing, those circuits almost always involved in human awareness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to the part it plays in short-term memory and executive and control functions).</seg>
		<seg id="14">This broad region is more advanced in humans than it is in other primates, and it seems to be entirely missing in other creatures.</seg>
		<seg id="15">So at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the knowledge who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man's linguistic nature: Because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language, it's often said that their awareness depends on it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In that case, animals could be excluded.</seg>
		<seg id="18">But even if awareness was not dependent on language, it would certainly be affected by it, meaning that animal awareness, however it may be defined, would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That's why it is so difficult to determine what animal awareness may be like.</seg>
		<seg id="20">If you have something that, being internal and subjective, can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience, then its study comes with significant challenges.</seg>
		<seg id="21">My explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness, but aside from that, there is another important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Animal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content, and that's exactly what's happening in the study of the short-term memory of primates, particularly when it comes to the example of visualization.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But this approach, which was followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is concerned with the neural correlates of awareness rather than the causal mechanisms, which may or may not be identical.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal cortex for the generation of the visualization.</seg>
		<seg id="25">What does this mean for feelings, now?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Let me remind you that an emotional system like that of fear is triggered in a brain that's aware of its own activity.</seg>
		<seg id="27">What we call `fear,' consequently, is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its effects, such as physical reactions) is using virtual memory.</seg>
		<seg id="28">From that perspective, feelings are closely tied to those regions of the cortex which are unique to primates, and humans in particular.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In conjunction with the linguistic nature, the result are delicate emotional shades, because through words and grammar we can differentiate between states and categorize them, in order to project them onto others as well.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In contrast to this, Antonio Damasio supposes, for instance, that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations. Jaak Pankseep says something similar, but his focus is more on the brainstem.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Since this network hadn't changed in the course of human evolution, they say, it might well be a cause of cross-species sensations.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In theory, I can't disagree with that, but I consider it improvable.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it, as well, in both cases. But how can we determine whether rats and humans feel the same thing when they act in similar ways?</seg>
		<seg id="34">A roach's response to danger is flight. Does it experience fear?</seg>
		<seg id="35">As far as I'm concerned, a mere similarity of actions is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The neural comparison is helpful, granted: Rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas roaches do not even have brains.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But is the brainstem responsible for emotions?</seg>
		<seg id="38">And even if it could be proved for humans - how would one want to prove it for rats?</seg>
		<seg id="39">I believe rats and other mammals - maybe even roaches (who knows?) - have emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But I wouldn't know how to prove it.</seg>
		<seg id="41">And because their feelings are supposedly fundamentally different from ours (since human awareness is based on specific circuits and on language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.</seg>
		<seg id="42">There is the promise of results on the neural level here, in any case, provided the same can be measured in rats and humans.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Just like I don't study language and awareness in rats, neither do I study their emotions, given that I don't even know if they exist.</seg>
		<seg id="44">One may consider that to be short-sighted, but I prefer to make progress, rather than to keep hitting a wall.</seg>
		<seg id="45">I just happen to be a practical emotionalist.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In the first half-year of 2008, flights and rooms in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In Germany, flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent, a current survey says.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again, according to a survey by travel and financial services provider American Express.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Analyzing its booking data from the first half-year of 2008, the company found that, after an increase of rates in the first quarter, there was a significant drop in the second quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Following years of increasing rates in the hotel market, rooms have already become cheaper in many places.</seg>
		<seg id="6">From January to March, rates in 41 out of 48 analyzed European cities were still increasing by an average 6.9 percent compared to 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But from April to June, rates had already dropped by 3.6 percent versus the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The trend was most visible in Paris and Rome, the survey says, where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">American Express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this, as it results in a `decreasing desire for travel among American tourists.'</seg>
		<seg id="10">Financial centers like Frankfurt and London were hit harder by the dropping hotel rates than industry locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger, it further says.</seg>
		<seg id="11">With an increase of 26.3 percent, hotel rates in the Norwegian city are holding the record for Europe, even.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Flight rates were also still trending up in the first quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Due to the increasing cost of kerosene, economy-class travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more on average than in 2007, while rates for more fuel-intensive long-range flights even went up by as much as 29.2 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From April to June, economy-class flight rates dropped by an average 12.5 percent versus the preceding quarter, whereas business- and first-class price changes were much less noticeable.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Germany, rates dropped even more sharply than in other European countries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">From January to March, rates had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The rates of domestic German flights were halved even, a survey says.</seg>
		<seg id="18">On the one hand, the sudden drop in rates was the result of the slowing economic growth, the company says.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Demand was receding in many segments of the air-travel market, it says.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On the other hand, there was an increase in competitive pressure through the Open Skies Agreement, which deregulates air travel between the U.S. and Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Among the signs of increasing tension were the cancelation of unprofitable routes at airlines, it says, as well as the high number of airlines filing for bankruptcy in the first half-year of 2008 - in Europe alone, it was 24 airlines, it says.</seg>

		<seg id="1">For years, a mysterious phenomenon has had researchers stumped: Dark matter is affecting the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.</seg>
		<seg id="3">For almost 18 years, the probe `Ulysses' has been flying through space.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Due to freezing fuel lines, it is now threatening to shut down.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion for years - the Swing-By Anomaly.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The swing-by is a flight maneuver during which space probes gain additional acceleration in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It enables the probes to save a lot of fuel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens made use of this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But what researches have been wondering about for years is this: The objects in flight are not behaving precisely in the way we have come to expect according to the venerable law of gravitation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Rather, there are irregularities in their speed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The probes unexpectedly become faster or slower.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To date, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.</seg>
		<seg id="13">They have dubbed it the Swing-By Anomaly.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The American physicist Stephen Adler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and is trying to explain the Swing-By Anomaly by way of the so-called dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe.</seg>
		<seg id="16">`It could be dark matter existing very close to Earth that may be responsible for the anomaly,' he writes.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Space researchers have only been aware of the existence of dark matter for about ten years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Evidently, it emits a gravitational force whose effect on other celestial bodies is measurable.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The dark matter itself is completely invisible, however, meaning that it neither sends nor emits any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, such as, consequently, visible light in particular.</seg>

		<seg id="8">The European tourists abducted in the Sahara have apparently been freed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Reports by Egyptian state television, the Arabian TV channel al-Arabiya and Italian media are in accordance on that.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to Italian TV channel Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: `Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Right now we are checking their health,' Frattini said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions were safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The 19 participants of a desert expedition were already on their way to Cairo, it said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The circumstances of the shoot-out preceding the release remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security agent, the captors were ready to end the abduction when the Sudanese army suddenly killed six of the abductors.</seg>
		<seg id="15">`The problem had been solved.</seg>
		<seg id="16">They had agreed to a ransom,' the agent said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It had been `only a matter of receiving the hostages,' when suddenly `this surprise' happened.</seg>
		<seg id="18">On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the abductors and taken two as prisoners in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The abductors had demanded a ransom of six million Euros from Germany; the money was to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Citing a German negotiator, the daily newspaper `El Masri El Jom' reported that the release was being delayed because the kidnappers were fearing for their safety.</seg>
		<seg id="21">According to the report, the abductors intended to release the female hostages once the ransom had been paid.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The men were to be held captive until the abductors would have secured an escape route.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself, a court has been told.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Truro Crown Court heard he regularly tied up his step-daughter Stephanie Randle, when she was aged between five and seven.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Trerise wrote in a confession note: &quot;I feel responsible for her death.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">The court heard that Ms Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, aged 34.</seg>
		<seg id="6">When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before performing sexual acts, while her mother was out working at a pub.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.</seg>
		<seg id="8">His step-daughter went to Plymouth.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But the court heard that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse which had been inflicted on her twice-weekly.</seg>
		<seg id="10">By 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court, friends said Ms Randle, who had been a keen surfer and cyclist, was &quot;emotionally dead&quot;, and had &quot;given up on life&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In April 2007 her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead at her flat in Plymouth.</seg>
		<seg id="12">She is thought to have killed herself through suffocation using a plastic bag.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mr Randle confronted his daughter's step-father, who wrote a confession letter which ended: &quot;I used to tie her up and blindfold her.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I didn't sexually assault her.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I feel responsible for her death.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: &quot;You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking her own life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Even more stark, is the fact that had she not done so, it's very doubtful that matters would have ended up in court.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He added: &quot;I note the effect Stephanie's father and mother describe your crime having on their daughter over the years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;She was plainly otherwise likely to have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Britain's building societies could face a bill of more than £80m after the rescue of the Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley bank.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Government provided £14bn to protect the deposits of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley's 2.6 million savers.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The interest on that loan will be paid by all firms that take savers' money, including the 59 building societies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was &quot;galling&quot; that societies and their members had to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The £14bn loan will eventually be repaid as Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But the interest which will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies would be included in that number.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is galling that those institutions that behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent</seg>
		<seg id="9">Adrian Coles, BSA</seg>
		<seg id="10">It said each firm had to pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the societies between them had to pay about 18% of the cost.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to £450m in 2009.</seg>
		<seg id="12">That means the societies will have to find £81m to pay the first year's interest.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Adrian Coles, director general of the building societies' trade association, told the BBC he believes that is unfair.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It is galling that those institutions that behaved prudently in the housing market upswing are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the BSA, no society has failed since its records began in 1945.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;We will need to examine all the aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill,&quot; added Mr Cole.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The interest due in 2009 cover seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In 2010 a full year's interest will be due and that could be almost twice as much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Since building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders, their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower interest rates on saving accounts.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail over charges of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was PM.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The case is one of several corruption charges pending against her.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's military-backed caretaker government should first give her full freedom.</seg>

		<seg id="2">BSkyB has been told by the Competition Appeal Tribunal to cut its holding in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Previously, the commission said that BSkyB's stake thwarted competition and allowed it unfair influence over ITV.</seg>
		<seg id="4">BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal which effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that BSkyB's acquisition of its stake in ITV shed doubt on the independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to launch a probe.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The US attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine US attorneys in 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The move came as a report into the affair by the inspector general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the probe lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,&quot; Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The row began when nine US attorneys were removed from their positions by the US Department of Justice in December 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the time, the department said that the attorneys had been fired for poor performance.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But it later emerged that the fired attorneys had not been rated any more poorly than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the sackings had been politically-motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Some of the attorneys had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.</seg>

		<seg id="15">A number of other justice department officials also resigned.</seg>

		<seg id="1">New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other byways, some famous, others merely utilitarian.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.</seg>
		<seg id="4">About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active thoroughfare.</seg>
		<seg id="5">There are no street signs.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It is virtually impossible to see on a standard atlas.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The street does, however, have admirers.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For instance, there is Avalon Bay, the developer of recently constructed luxury buildings on First Street.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It wants to repave Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Other admirers include longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block's pregentrified past.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in holding on to it.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At a meeting of the neighborhood community board's land use committee this month, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the committee prefers that the street remain in the city's hands, and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community Board 3.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;There's very little city-owned space left, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;There could be proposals to fix it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the little street and install seats, including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The idea that Avalon Bay might buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that though the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;Avalon Bay's principal concern is refurbishing this derelict alleyway and turning it into a public amenity,&quot; she said, adding that the city had suggested the sale.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Housing Preservation, said it was indeed the city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Compared with its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical footprint.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Some believe it got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened onto Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the setting for the cover photograph of the Ramones' album &quot;Rocket to Russia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The ground was magnificent,&quot; said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;It was filled with junk, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that ought to be left alone.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, &quot;The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct&quot;), posted part of a Talk of the Town story about Extra Place that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a narrow little dead-end street, dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with week-old newspapers blowing along the gutters.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="30">With a few exceptions, the street looked much the same on a recent evening.</seg>
		<seg id="31">A rat skittered across the back of the street near a door that used to lead into CBGB, which is now the site of an upscale clothing store.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Graffiti was on walls and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay near a fresh batch of discarded newspapers.</seg>
		<seg id="33">A few passersby said that they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggested that it could use some sprucing up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mr. Fields, for his part, said he thought that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">&quot;The best years of my life,&quot; he said, &quot;were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">In this installment of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' positions on bilingual education.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of education studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book &quot;Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Making effective appeals to Hispanic voters is a tricky business.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Barack Obama's education proposals are a case in point.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Mr. Obama's campaign notes that, &quot;African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; which is true.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To combat such achievement gaps, Mr. Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for English-learners.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Yet, the question for Mr. Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom instruction in languages other than English, overrides his interest in closing achievement gaps.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The school's students are overwhelmingly Hispanic and low income.</seg>
		<seg id="10">More than a third of the students, many of whom are recent arrivals, are learning English.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Yet, among fourth graders, an astounding 100 percent of the students tested at the proficient level on the 2008 state math exam.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth graders tested proficient on the state English-language-arts exam.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This incredible success was achieved using a different ingredient than the one favored by Mr. Obama.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of skills and a no-excuses attitude.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Furthermore, and here's where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street's principal, the school's instructional approach for English learners is &quot;full immersion.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">English immersion emphasizes the near-exclusive use of English in content instruction.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, &quot;we've had tremendous success with having a student who is brand new from Mexico and you would walk into a classroom 12 months later and you wouldn't be able to pick out which one he was.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;It's working,&quot; she observed, &quot;it's working for us.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">Would Mr. Obama hold up a school like Sixth Street Prep as one model for replication by other schools with large Hispanic and English-learner populations?</seg>
		<seg id="20">The school's achievement results should make the answer to that question a no-brainer, but the education politics within his own party (the National Education Associations has been a long-time supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education obscure predicting Mr. Obama's response.</seg>
		<seg id="21">While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Mr. Obama recently trivialized the issue when he said that people should stop worrying about &quot;English-only&quot; legislation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Instead, he said, &quot;you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="23">If Mr. Obama truly wishes to close achievement gaps, he should carefully consider education models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After spending more time in a Jets uniform the last eight-plus seasons than anyone, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Then he watched the second quarter unfold Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a blowout.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;Never seen anything quite like that,&quot; Ellis said.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had matched the gloomy clouds hanging overhead with sloppy play.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown strike, providing the perfect harbinger for an afternoon when their evolving connection took a giant leap forward.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell down and another with 10 seconds left in the half.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;I didn't go out of my way,&quot; Favre said of all the passes that went to Coles.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;He's a hell of a player.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense battered Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted an errant throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Safety Eric Smith tipped another pass and intercepted it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Linebacker David Bowens forced a fumble by Warner.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, might have been the most egregious.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Cardinals had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal for a 34-0 lead.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It was the most the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Asked to describe the craziness of it, Jets Coach Eric Mangini said, &quot;The second quarter or the third quarter?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">When he was told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: &quot;I can tell you I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than I did the third quarter.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the greatest distance runner ever, breaking his own world record in the marathon in Berlin on Sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2-mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With a victory on the accommodatingly flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2:04:26, run last year in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of a career of such stunning breadth that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that the air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Instead, he signed to run in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won Sunday while averaging a blistering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have turned to longer distances, the record for the marathon has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="8">After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and had missed a week of training.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Clearly, the layoff left him fresh, not rusty.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;I'm so happy,&quot; Gebrselassie told reporters.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Everything was perfect.</seg>
		<seg id="12">I started again a week ago, and had some doubts today, but in the end everything was fine.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">He has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a track race, and placing world records ahead of a sense of competition.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But this criticism hardly diminishes the greatness of Gebrselassie's skill as a distance runner.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Paced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point in 1:02:04.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept challenging Gebrselassie after the pacemakers faded.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Kamathi took third in 2:07:48.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh-fastest time ever.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.</seg>
		<seg id="22">She missed the Beijing Games with what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she has run.</seg>
		<seg id="23">She ran a race of smart calculation, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners break out to a wide lead, then reeling them after about 18 ½ miles.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia took second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.</seg>

		<seg id="0">In a Town Apart, the Pride and Trials of Black Life</seg>
		<seg id="1">Hidden in the theme-park sprawl of greater Orlando, a few miles from the shiny, the loud and the gargantuan, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Eatonville, the first all-black town to incorporate in the country and the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: &quot;the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools and no jailhouse.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is now a place of pilgrimage.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to pay their respects to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And yet in many ways, the town she described - and made a tourist stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place apart.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It is as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true thoughts with the white man, who &quot;knowing so little about us, he doesn't know what he is missing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has called for an open conversation about race, many here remain wary of the outsider's gaze.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;We're very cautious about how our story is told,&quot; said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the town's oldest church.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;It needs to be right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is both a historic model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rates are twice the national average.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It is a literary hub but also an oak-shaded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes praised - that was born of American slavery.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And the concern about Eatonville's image really began with Zora, which is all anyone here calls Hurston.</seg>
		<seg id="15">She introduced the world to her hometown through heartfelt, dialect-heavy books like &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937).</seg>
		<seg id="16">Five paragraphs in the Florida guidebook transformed the town, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the oft-forgotten center of Florida into a stage of black history and human drama.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Bold as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, then veered into more private areas.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Off the road on the left,&quot; she wrote, &quot;is the brown-with-white-trim modern public school, with its well-kept yards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always looks after, though he can scarcely read and write.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn &quot;sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transient rooms.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage and sex.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Clearly, Fodor's this was not.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In fact, it was not a portrait everyone appreciated.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Zora told it like it was,&quot; said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off-color songs about their beauty.</seg>
		<seg id="24">She added: &quot;Some people didn't like that.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston sped into town, she usually arrived without notice in a thumping Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a town that even today prides itself on dignified dress.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many sneered.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;People were always glad to see Zora,&quot; Mr. Franklin said.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But, he added, rocking in his chair on a back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, &quot;she never did stay too long.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="30">When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had fallen out of print.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Along with much of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Though she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had been living.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In Eatonville, there were no major memorial services, no grand public readings.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;I don't think they understood her contribution to the world or her legacy at all,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows,&quot; a Hurston biography published in 2003.</seg>
		<seg id="35">A turning point came in the 1980s.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community's puttering two-lane main street.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Orlando's sprawl had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of town.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Forced integration, among other things, had ended the community's relatively idyllic isolation.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In the 1950s, the fight over racial mixing brought hate to the community's doorstep.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;During that time, a bunch of white boys, they would come through and throw oranges and things at people sitting down on the side,&quot; Mr. Franklin said.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;We actually had a lady that got killed from that once.</seg>
		<seg id="43">They threw a watermelon out of the car.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration, calling its decision in Brown v. Board of Education &quot;insulting rather than honoring my race.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Residents now say that the desegregation of schools, while positive in some respects, diluted Eatonville's cohesiveness and undermined the confidence of its youth.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;Black children were accustomed to being hugged - I remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night,&quot; said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.</seg>
		<seg id="47">That lasted, she added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.</seg>
		<seg id="48">&quot;You were not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide there,&quot; Ms. Nathiri said.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who rose above prejudice, like she did, with buoyant self-assurance and lines like: &quot;How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company!</seg>
		<seg id="50">It's beyond me.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="51">In 1975, the writer Alice Walker trekked to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Five years later, an acclaimed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookshelves, reintroducing her to the American canon.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter had once again found the spotlight.</seg>
		<seg id="54">And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.</seg>
		<seg id="55">The community began planning in 1988 for a Hurston festival to show what the county could ruin with its highway.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many return for the celebration.</seg>
		<seg id="57">After several years, the county backed away from its road proposal.</seg>
		<seg id="58">&quot;The five-laning of the highway resurrected, it put in what you'd call warp speed, real civic pride,&quot; Ms. Nathiri said.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Ms. Boyd put it more simply: &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">Victory over the highway project has helped change the town's self-image.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, started to appear in larger numbers, and residents started to revalue the past.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Eatonville joined the national historic registry in 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="63">A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from downtown Orlando, it can, at times, feel like a back street in a summer rain, as small as it did when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.</seg>
		<seg id="65">(It is 90 percent black today.)</seg>
		<seg id="66">Outsiders who come looking for Eatonville's story, its meaning, are often still treated with caution.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Advance permission is required for most interviews, and certain things - like the murals at Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.</seg>
		<seg id="68">Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a bold, confident teacher partial to bright red, still fear that their insular community will be misunderstood.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a heightened level of hometown pride has also emerged.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and all, no better, no worse and as proud, creative, hard-working, silly and mixed-up as other racial and ethnic groups in America.</seg>
		<seg id="71">It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to come back to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, which he said could use some help.</seg>
		<seg id="72">And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">&quot;Most people, if they just drive through here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones,' &quot; Alondra Kenon said after church on a recent Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="74">&quot;But if you actually stop and take a moment to look at the history, it's a very nice city.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="4">Over 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun, near Linz, some time between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organised action.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The offenders sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David over some of the graves, but detectives believe this may have been a bid to disguise the motives of extremists driven by a hatred of Muslim immigrants.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It is not clear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Police in Kent were granted the foreign travel ban last Thursday after giving magistrates evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for child sex abuse.</seg>

		<seg id="5">A Court Service spokesman said:&quot;On Thursday September 25 at Ashford Magistrates' Court, Kent Police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to France and Spain until March 25 by Mr Paul Gadd.</seg>

		<seg id="11">I'm very interested in creating an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco by my camera.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Bauer began his path to portray singers, guitarists and dancers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival &quot;Cante de las Minas&quot;. He likes to use a plate camera.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Due to the choice of the camera and the equipment, These portraits remember the classic photos.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the iconographic traditional principles, giving the photos modernity, as Bauer considers flamenco: &quot;A music with very traditional roots which evolves and still surprises every day more.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is not the dancing, the singing or the playing itself, but the artist's personality, his character, able to conquer the audience through his art.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The search for a meeting with the essentiality, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling, are and have been constant elements in this work, now on display at the gallery El Fotómata.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chan Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrija, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo among others, are included in this selection of around seventy portrayed artists.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The project has also become an anthology of flamenco, going to be published in a book which collects the portraits displayed at the exhibition.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The passion for the portrait led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with &quot;Portraits of veteran athletes&quot;(&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).</seg>
		<seg id="20">Although in &quot;Flamenco-People&quot; the concept is different, the photographer admits &quot;I love to portray people, to know them and to penetrate into their lives for a while, being this a long or short moment.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I think portray is the most difficult subject in photography.</seg>
		<seg id="22">You meet or face people and characters sometimes you even know or persons who bestow you only a few minutes to take the picture.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; is exhibit ed at the gallery El Fotómata, Via de la Mata 20, which is a parallel street to Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of October.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject. Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with the new project he is working at, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in Congo and crossed Amazon.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The writer, always favoured for the Nobel Prize in Literature, confessed yesterday during the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the draft he is dealing with is a &quot;chance&quot; and that everything indicates that I should not write it down.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;If I had good sense, I do not write it at all, but I'm going ahead anyway and I hope to finish it once and for all,&quot; he concluded his speech at this festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that saw many guests, during the four days, passing by the Aqueduct's city. Hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people joined it.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The author of &quot;La ciudad y los perros&quot; was a prominent figure in the third edition of the word's festival, as forecasted.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize being the most voted writer by participants - an ancient edition of &quot;Our mutual friend&quot; by Dickens, packed the theatre Juan Bravo with fans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Introduced by Félix Romeo, the writer faced a public whose time flew away when the Peruvian author, started to recall with a prodigious memory and with large doses of humour, the way he discovered his literary vocation, derived from the &quot;extraordinary adventure and the pleasure of reading.&quot; This is &quot;living beyond life&quot;, as he put it in. He explained why orderly basis in writing permits &quot;to remove the lack of inspiration,&quot; through an intense work of documentation, editing and revising. He underlined how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas affected his vocation and said that the &quot;images of memory&quot; are the foundation from which his stories spring up.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Hispanic-American novelist, acknowledged that &quot;there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people's lives. I refuse to believe that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience,&quot; said Vargas Llosa who, also supported that &quot;the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist.&quot; So he suggested the writers &quot;not to give into frivolity&quot; and to &quot;take the responsibility&quot; of their own vocation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Weather hampers the Pozoblanco festival, which remains with no bullfights</seg>
		<seg id="9">The bullfights which were to seal the days of the festival of Pozoblanco were suspended yesterday morning after the bull fighters had assured that the square's soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Therefore, the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the bullfighting.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The weather was rather fierce against this Festival and prevented two over three celebrations.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Saturday, the rain had prevented the holding of the second bullfight.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The billboard included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have faced a bull of Castilblanco.</seg>
		<seg id="14">So far, the only celebration took place on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This was the triumph of Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought on shoulders after he had bull fought with taste and aesthetics.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights and collected greetings and one ear, granted by the public more than by the quality of the bullfight itself.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Among all, the worst was El Juli, who passed by the bull-ring of Los Llanos gaining no glory, no penalty.</seg>
		<seg id="18">With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the boos of a bigger part of the public.</seg>

		<seg id="0">&quot;Sangre de mayo&quot;, an epic challenge by Garci.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Jose Luis Garci, inspired by the novel Episodios Nacionales of Banito Pérez Galdós, recreates in Sangre de mayo the spanish popular riot against the French. This is the most ambitious work of his filmography, with a nearly 15 million euro budget.</seg>
		<seg id="2">With this film, the director has tried to &quot;explain the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis&quot; that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he said today, during the film's presentation, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría heading a larger cast of interpreters.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Sangre de mayo, a film longer than 2.30 hours, debuts this Friday at the cinemas, to become a four hours TV miniseries on TeleMadrid in next future.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Great fan of Galdós' literature, Jose Luis Garci claims this shooting realized &quot;a dream of his childhood&quot;. He likes to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years earlier, had commissioned him to shoot a film to commemorate the second centenary of the Madrid 2nd of May. This was the desire expressed by the Community of Madrid. The director agreed on condition that the story grounded on the novel Episodios Nacionales.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The 15 million budget totally allocated by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a &quot;stunned Spain that chose the wrong leader to fight for and the fact that the fight for independence led people to a huge delay in development during the reign of Ferdinand VII&quot; said Garci.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, the director regrets not having received equal funds of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice compared to Sangre de mayo. So far, it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan, he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, his career-long collaborator.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of Volver a empezar: for example, the staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to rehearse before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast, considering this &quot;humiliating&quot; and thinking that &quot;the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">A certain number of interpreters, some of which fall within the cast of Sangre de mayo, repeat in front of his video-camera. It is the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Four times in the Oscar nominations - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent Spain at Hollywood this year, his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés, and the Los selected ulitmo girasoles ciegos do represent the Spanish cinema's younger generation, &quot;that should be known instead.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Garci does not expect awards from this film.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Isabel Bayon rediscovers the essence of the siviglian dancer Tortola Valencia</seg>
		<seg id="2">A siviglian dancer pays tribute to another siviglian dancer.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Carmen Valencia Tortola, father from Catalonia (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother from Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and moved with her family to London when three.</seg>
		<seg id="4">She was a ballet dancer and a free style and oriental dances' specialist.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Her life was rather fascinating and she was a pioneer of women's emancipation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.</seg>
		<seg id="6">She was Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the corset's abolition because it prevented women from moving freely.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aesthetics of dance in Europe between the two wars, had always fascinated Isabel Bayon.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I'd liked to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she proposed me to interpret this character. It seemed to me incredible.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the dancer &quot;we do not pretend to tell her whole life, but to collect her spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Her dances' titles suggested me some elements of flamenco.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Thus, &quot;la danza de la Mariposa&quot; suggested me a guajira, or the &quot;danza de la serpiente&quot; some tangos.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Her dance was sensual and I was told my way of dancing is part of this aesthetic, too&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The staging includes two outstanding contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of the shows, the same he did in &quot;La puerta abierta&quot;, and the master Matilde Coral, which exceptionally wanted to work together with a former student of hers.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Matilde interprets Tortola in the adulthood, she is the character of maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I'm very happy she accepted to play in my work and I feel very honoured for this.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">The staging also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers as Miguel Ortega, Pulga y Moi of Morón and the percussion of El Pájaro, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez &quot;who plays the role of eternal companion of artists like her, who were real round stars, and always had many lovers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">This work also tell something of this woman's life because it was mainly held in distant places, particularly for her time, such as India, United States or Russia, as well as the whole Europe, using her to reside in London.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;I wanted to remember her, because I think she was one of that women who had an enormous influence in a specific historical period. Nowadays nobody remembers of her and even considers her work as something of value&quot; supports Bayon.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The show will be on stage starting from today, 20.30pm, at the theatre Lope de Vega.</seg>

		<seg id="12">For all people he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and a supporter of lost and won causes, starting from the foundation to fight drugs he created in honour of the firstborn who died of overdoses until the promotion of a new brand for home-made and organic food.</seg>

		<seg id="2">But I wonder, are we ready?</seg>
		<seg id="3">If we follow the example of yesterday race, I just say no!</seg>
		<seg id="4">They called it the &quot;perfect race&quot; but in my opinion it was by far the worst I witnessed.</seg>
		<seg id="5">All a nonsense, that if taken into account during the evaluation and I had to examine it, the output would be totally negative.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But let's go with order and start from the very beginning.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The nonsense began with the collection of the back number, which presupposed you went there before the race.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It did not seem a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it should be to withdraw all things (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).</seg>
		<seg id="9">But this was not.</seg>
		<seg id="10">We went there just to collect the back number (first nonsense, just go for this only reason) and (after the queue), surprise! they only had &quot;S&quot; size T-shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL).</seg>
		<seg id="11">What kind of world are we living in?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Is it to blame the crisis if they bought only small T-shirts, made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive?</seg>
		<seg id="13">Well, these things were nothing if compared with the day of the race.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We had to go very early to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and, furthermore, you had to deposit your backpack.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where you expect more than 11,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Then, as expected, the race started when we had not even handed over the backpack, although, once succeeded, the recovery was even worse.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In addition, the rain threatened the waiting longer than 40 minutes, which went along with a kind of popular rebellion and an attempted assault to stand.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I believe we will be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow, and some, like me, not even resulted in the proper arrival order because of the chip, which, I suppose, did not record the arrival time properly.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In future, if I will be asked for the perfect race, this one wont't certainly enter in my thoughts.</seg>
		<seg id="20">At the end of the day, I think we will continue to dream of an Olympic and well prepared city.</seg>

		<seg id="1">During the conference on Emerging Technologies at the MIT, Microsoft presented a preview of the new recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without that much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as call a taxi (or, in the scenario described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus) &quot;understanding&quot; what happens in a standard conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Thanks to a camera and a forms and faces' recognition system, this &quot;receptionist&quot; may know how many people are there in a specific room, who are they – including remember what's their position - and listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It may also clustered people in groups of conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person, understands he does not belong to the group he is talking with and that he is not a company's employee.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It asks him if he's there to visit someone and says it will attend him as soon as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This without any awful blue screen.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Awesome.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But this is the future, of course.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now the company needs to focus on many other issues, such as the next Windows operating system's release.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week it was a big talk on Microsoft's change of strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many programs.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less commercial rubbish, these should be five times faster - hey! Steve, will be for less.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A real discovery, if one takes into account the fact that Microsoft, version after version has only added features and &quot;extras&quot; to Windows.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The change of direction is very welcome.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Microsoft is right: the operating system will be increasingly losing importance, and the software with it.</seg>
		<seg id="16">When Google launched Chrome, I was one of those who supported the theory this was the first step Google made to compete with Windows.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The operating system will be always a necessity because it is the essential element through which hardware and software can communicate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It performs the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It's true.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It won't ever disappear, perhaps you just need to think about the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one.</seg>
		<seg id="22">What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.</seg>
		<seg id="23">People give less attention to the operating system, and increasingly focus on the browser.</seg>
		<seg id="24">They only use the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - daily and spend a longer time browsing the web rather than working in a window environment.</seg>
		<seg id="25">What half of the operating system's applications are there for?</seg>
		<seg id="26">Less is more.</seg>
		<seg id="27">And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.</seg>
		<seg id="29">A Microsoft more interested in integrating its online services should constitute a viable alternative to Google.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pablo Picasso used to dress it while in the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone with one of this in 'Diamante de sangre' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola. Moreover, it is part of the typical uniform worn by the muscular gay parish.</seg>

		<seg id="4">It is the 'tank', as English speakers call it, though, the Brussels Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.</seg>
		<seg id="5">First of all, this is due to its grandiose name - even if it is commonly known just as &quot;Marcel&quot; - name that has something to do with the sport because it derives, according to the legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loved the singer Edith Piaf.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The &quot;Marcel&quot; excels - if compared to the others - for its high quality cotton, for its unisex cutting, for his distinctive little shield and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which the most emblematic models keep as a detail on the neck.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And open your eyes!, because the Belgian company does not produce only its famous &quot;tank&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Currently, both the Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activity in the fashion field.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to Monica, it is much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their names.</seg>
		<seg id="5">She went to Paris for the campaign Mango is hanging on to promote the new branch, and the presentation of the most important prizes for fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Warm and timid, she conquers you quite quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Tell us what you're doing in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I came here to present the new collection my sister Penelope and I have designed for the new Mango autumn-winter season, to join the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Let's say, a very intense day but a very exciting one, at the same time.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What is the inspiration of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish fashion house?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Both my sister that I like the cinema of the 50s and 60s. From there we get bigger inspirations.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Then, I like to get lost in the city and look at how women dress, at the way they combine and mix their clothes. I do it quite frequently.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?</seg>
		<seg id="14">I think so, although at the very end, all merged and many elements remain cross-field ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I liked clothes since I was a child. I loved to visit my grandmother to rummage in my aunt's cupboards and discover her clothes.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It was so good!, much better than going to the amusement park.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Then, once a dancer, I always took great care of my dressing.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It is known dancers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals, to look themselves in the mirror and feel good.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And in the actress role, when you are delivered the wardrobe, this is the time you actually encounter the character.</seg>
		<seg id="20">So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Not long ago, you celebrated your 30 years, did you entered a crisis?</seg>
		<seg id="22">Absolutely I didn't.</seg>
		<seg id="23">I've never felt better, I like to be 30 years old.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I find it is the age when women are mature enough and can take advantage of a good experience to enjoy life and commit fewer errors.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I'm not scared by the biological clock.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Since I was a child, I did all the things I liked to do and this gave me a great inner happiness.</seg>
		<seg id="27">So, are you thinking of being mother or not?</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yes, of course, I'm. I know it is my same body pushing me for this and also I want to be a young mom, I'm not gonna miss it.</seg>
		<seg id="29">And about the candidate… Does not matter that much.</seg>
		<seg id="30">I will give my son a lot of happiness and I will educate him with bigger love.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Talking about cinema, you are waiting the release of some films you acted last year.</seg>
		<seg id="32">That is, and I'm really curious about that.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Coming from the theatrical experience, I am a very impatient and anxious woman, I want everything now and clearly, but I know this may not be always possible.</seg>
		<seg id="34">I'm looking forward mainly for &quot;La última hora&quot; and &quot;En busca de la tumba de Cristo&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="36">Few days ago you debuted on the catwalk side by side with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?</seg>

		<seg id="38">It's not I was on the catwalk as a professional model.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I know since a long time, called and invited me to go to London and attend a charity fashion show for her organization &quot;Women for a Better World&quot;. The clothes presented during the show - I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango - have been sold at auction to raise funds for this Naomi's NGO.</seg>
		<seg id="40">People usually ignore this Naomi's tender heart.</seg>
		<seg id="41">It is said so many things on her, that, knowing her quite well, I can assure you are not true.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Moreover, I like to share and get involved in this good part of hers.</seg>
		<seg id="43">She asked me to be shown for a noble cause, but if I had asked to play a pine, I would do it anyway.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Interior Office wants the driver under three administrative penalties for excessive alcoholic rate, to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when drunk. The same if you do not blow into the measuring device.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The measure was announced last June and has been already included in the Annual Report of the State Attorney General, according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This project's goal is the reinstatement of the driver, since he will need to attend a course of road re-education.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The initiative is supported by the Attorney General for Road Safety, together with the General Directorate of Traffic(DGT) and the Technological Institute Foundation for Security in the Automobile(FITS).</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving, still drive a car.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The 'alcolock' would avoid this, because the device, connected to the vehicle, measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it, or in case it detects in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The cost of the device, a bit more than 1000 euro, should be charged to the sanctioned.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In this regard, a study conducted in 2007 in the United States proved that vehicles equipped with these devices can reduce the infringements up to 65% during the first year of introduction.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And in Spain it was estimated it could save around 115 lives in one year.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: first of all to stop these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And second, to facilitate the implementation of this practice, as the legal reform can be ordinarily made, but, on the contrary, the necessary reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transports.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote a PSOE's initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in school buses, as has already been done in France.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Probably there is not a more appropriate place in the world than Paris to present a fashion award, and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as Valentino.</seg>

		<seg id="3">It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in the Mango's window at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann – Paris, and was almost crying for emotion.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Moreover, the company's store is the second largest in Europe, recently opened on 1335 square meters' space.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The most important one is located in London.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The numerous events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the contest, brought us to a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The proximity of the most exquisite paintings by Chagal made the presidential gala table prepared by Mango even more spectacular.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nati, with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity, because of the recent death of her brother, wore a dress of the company and fashion complements by ELAH that took your breath away. So, arm in arm with her son Luis - a two meters height boy - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Andik, owner and master of Mango, welcomed the guests and as the gentleman he is, along with Baron Rotchil arrived at the end of the night without his jacket, because both had granted it to two ladies.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt - designed by herself – changed her dress for the dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress. She got very excited when, during the night walk inside the opera house, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the room for dance recitals, and recalling other times, she grabbed a bar and outlined a &quot;grand plie&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inés Sastre did not join the walk inside the building, but before leaving, showed us her son's photos on her mobile phone.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Speaking while sleeping</seg>
		<seg id="1">Some children speak during the night.</seg>
		<seg id="2">I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something happened to them the day before, but those children who talk while asleep.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The first time it happens, at most, you get scared, but it really does not have that much importance.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This is a benign alteration of sleep, defined somniloquy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It is a quite common phenomenon, especially in children and adolescents.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Certainly, most of you have been told talked in your sleep.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (just once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or on a more regular basis (every day, once a week, once in the month ...). The day after the child does not remember anything.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There is not a single reason to explain the presence of somniloquy.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Sometimes it should be linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, nocturnal enuresis (do pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but it is not necessarily the case.</seg>
		<seg id="10">As mentioned above, it may be associated with stages of very high fever, in situations of stress or over excitement.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In any case, this phenomenon is not researched that well.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Even its intensity is extremely variable.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches ...).</seg>
		<seg id="14">In case the event is particularly intense, the child should be observed and possibly, a specialist should be consulted to check if the abnormal state of anxiety is due to any question, thus is generated by the child in order to vent his feelings.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We said that this is a benign alteration, therefore there is not a specific treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders which, instead, can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or a situation of stress).</seg>
		<seg id="16">What you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:</seg>
		<seg id="17">Try not to over-excite the child before going to sleep.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Propose calm games and avoid television programs or series that inspire fear or suggest violence.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Very nervous children for whom relaxing is a very hard task, need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm.</seg>
		<seg id="20">This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Once somniloquy appears, try to keep calm.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Remember that it is an inoffensive phenomenon for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of it.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Useful Tips</seg>
		<seg id="24">Don't wake him up.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is useless, because he is not aware of what is going on, and you just interrupt his sleeping.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Although he is talking, he is asleep and thus, he is resting.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Remember that if he appears very anguished and the episodes have a certain frequency is better to consult a doctor or to verify from where such a great anxiety comes from.</seg>
		<seg id="28">If you get what he is saying (which is not the most common situation) does not fall into temptation to make him an interrogation to obtain information.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Do not get anything, because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In addition, you are only able to hear what he says but you cannot see what he is dreaming about to say that things. Therefore, be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Do not ever tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secrets.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Not even jokingly.</seg>
		<seg id="33">This can generate a huge anxiety.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In short, do not worry, it's nothing serious, just  an episode that lasts few minutes.</seg>

		<seg id="3">The rhythm was not very steady during the match and the attackers found it hard to express themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="7">But the Illhaeusern striker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later, leaving his team-mates numerically inferior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">But Dannemarie could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the Illhaeusern Eleven who just fell back a little to make its defence more &quot;compact&quot;, except in the very last few seconds of the game where, after a big mess, the ball went very near the crosspiece.</seg>

		<seg id="11">The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked at the quayside or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The New York Stock Exchange showed a historical fall on Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson plan to rescue the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen before approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10365.45 points.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Nasdaq index, mainly technological, has lost 199.61 points to 1983.73 and the expanded Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1106.55 points, according to final closing figures.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Already suffering a depression at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street went down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the rescue plan for banks that was to inject some stability in the markets.</seg>
		<seg id="6">With 228 votes against and 205 for, the delegates have refused to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the resources he asked for.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;This is a bad signal for the market, which saw the Congress failing to adopt a plan, &quot;said Lindsey Piegża of FTN Financial.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;This shows how much the market relied on this plan,&quot; she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days time can be &quot;too late&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If the project is effectively dead (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (i.e. the U.S. central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tighten the credit conditions&quot;, predicted Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And further accentuating the sense of urgency, &quot;each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution&quot; in the United States, emphasised Mrs Piegża.</seg>
		<seg id="12">After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities have organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions by banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets face &quot;not only a crisis in U.S., but a global crisis&quot;, added the analyst from FTN Financial.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The bond market has climbed sharply.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The performance of 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, against  3.827% on Friday evening, and the 30-year bond to 4.161%, against 4.357% on the previous day.</seg>

		<seg id="1">To the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Not surprisingly, the campaign headquarters of the Republicans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of American families.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though admirable, was not &quot;brilliant&quot; enough to enable it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks from the presidential election.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Gallup, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives a five points lead to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrats have pulled their own on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to a CBS poll, among the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama has won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate her.</seg>
		<seg id="8">She has good instincts nonetheless&quot;, warned Bill Clinton this weekend.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the &quot;naivety&quot; of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial face-to-face debate.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ...&quot; he accused several times.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,&quot; he also assured.</seg>
		<seg id="12">An angle of attack hammered yesterday in Republican television advertisements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Obama, himself, has stressed that he represented the future.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;McCain has never understood, while Obama, if&quot;, argued this weekend, a Democratic spot criticizing the Republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the &quot;American on the streets&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;During the ninety-ten minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday to 20 000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He did not even utter the words &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;workers&quot;. &quot;The financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink of a precipice.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The coming week could be a turning point&quot;, estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, compared the &quot;good economic instincts&quot; of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="21">For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis &quot;is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also reported that the achievement of the country's energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, together with the establishment of a system of health insurance.</seg>
		<seg id="23">McCain, he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 2030.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Cautious, both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion Euro) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely unpopular.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Young people and other opponents demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the outcome of legislation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections.</seg>
		<seg id="3">While no results have as yet been announced, many young people came to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: &quot;the dictator, resignation.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Some confess to not having even voted: &quot;What for, since they will do whatever they want of my voice,&quot; said a youth.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in order to resume discussions with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The sanctions, which include visa bans for 40 Belarusian officials and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They have not been according to the opposition.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count,&quot; lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesperson for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;It's a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it's who counts the votes that is important, and here, that is the executive power.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But their entry into parliament could mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and proposed laws.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">The opposition should therefore enter the political game because &quot;we must open a dialogue with the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Because if our economy which is heavily in debt with Russia, enters into a crisis, and if we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We want to be independent&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the ballot.</seg>
		<seg id="16">She stressed that the participation figures seem too high, and that the spread in voter turnout (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the vote to all sorts of manipulations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;Have you noticed that there was an election, have you? Queries the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of two political prisoners released in August this year.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There was nobody at the voting offices.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, those who are most convenient to those in power.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">The interview - Blood becomes safe again</seg>
		<seg id="1">Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world.</seg>
		<seg id="2">And most importantly, it has regained the confidence of the public who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As we know, national reserves managed by the blood transfusion service of the Canadian Red Cross had been infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C during the 1980s.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Faced with this tragedy and public discontent, the Government of Canada established in February 1994 a public inquiry, headed by Justice Horace Krever, which aimed at shedding light on the circumstances which led to such a tragedy and making recommendations so that such a disaster never happens again.</seg>
		<seg id="5">While Judge Krever delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Quebec, the committee Gélineau has fulfilled that mandate.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In the wake of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and Canadian Blood Supply for all other provinces and the two territories.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The situation was discouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="10">By dint of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work during the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public&quot;, she says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Dr. Décary, nonetheless, thinks &quot;confidence is something extremely fragile&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">From its inception on the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At that time, there were in Europe with the outbreak of a number of cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;And we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through blood.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a serious illness may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, one establishes an excluding action.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In April 1999, the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">In 1999, on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for HIV testing: the nucleic acid testing (NAT) allowed to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus, which is what previous tests were based on.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The TAN helped to shorten the silent period, which runs between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It was able to reduce that period to less than a week.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Thus, it has substantially reduced the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.</seg>
		<seg id="23">These improvements have helped reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Today, a person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV contaminated blood.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Since Héma-Quebec each year distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">I believe that now we can feel at ease when receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recuperate our health&quot;, affirmed the CEO of Héma-Québec.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.</seg>
		<seg id="29">One never knows what disease will emerge in the system.</seg>
		<seg id="30">As recently as last year, there appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.</seg>
		<seg id="31">We must be constantly vigilant, &quot;continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities.</seg>
		<seg id="32">&quot;The demand is increasing as the population ages.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The treatments being more aggressive, patients often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The aging population also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="35">Any healthy person, aged 18 and over fits the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days, six times a year.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On average, 14% of those offering their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife, they would be excluded for a period of one year.</seg>
		<seg id="37">&quot;With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The shortages are very rare.</seg>
		<seg id="39">But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot donate their blood.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but even more so to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Life today runs so fast, there is rarely time to find an hour to donate one's blood&quot;, says Francine Décary miserably.</seg>
		<seg id="42">With an annual budget of $ 297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.</seg>
		<seg id="43">These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which manages also the only bank of placental blood in Quebec.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot; A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord blood and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year.</seg>
		<seg id="46">We should start to propose transplants at the beginning of next year, &quot;says Dr. Décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular.</seg>
		<seg id="47">&quot;Many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it&quot; because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Charest placed on the North</seg>
		<seg id="1">The prime minister does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year</seg>
		<seg id="2">Once the general council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest yesterday visited Jean-Talon, Quebec City, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to get elected in the by-election today.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;Pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier&quot;: this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Behind him, during his speech, a kind of mill of images was projected.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Rotating in a loop on three huge screens, were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams, mining developments, of Quebec seen through &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Like the mass media during elections.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Moreover, as a point to emphasise, the Prime Minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this fall, although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The &quot;North Plan&quot; is the fourth part of a &quot;vision&quot; that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a &quot;new economic space&quot;, which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Prime Minister had however to explain why the North was &quot;a jewel with an immense potential&quot;, but never given its due chance, investment money, or specific priority in future projects.</seg>
		<seg id="11">At most, a few avenues that could be further developed: including hydropower, the forest, but most of the entire mining sector, boosted by growth in emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The North contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds&quot;, according to Mr. Charest's list.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This territory is twice the size of France&quot;, &quot; it is here with us, it is in Quebec.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Not only is it with us, but it's also us&quot;, he insisted, to better show this he solicited a national founding myth.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The province has built much by its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James's Bay.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;We, our future,&quot; he added after a theatrical pause contemplating the immense map behind him.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed&quot;, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.</seg>
		<seg id="19">There is a border along which there has been no agreement for too long a time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position there on behalf of government&quot;, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, &quot;with the climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North&quot;, he declared, referring to the Northwest Passage, to be held open throughout the year due to melting ice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would benefit them, especially to young people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member Ungava PQ), have already started consultations with thirty communities.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, started work.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The Prime Minister has not excluded holding a big meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit,&quot; but a time when &quot;we give ourselves a common vision.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Northern development would also be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The North will be &quot;coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment&quot;, he promised.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as continuous with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded him.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;As the Liberals who have preceded us, we have alternatively thought to transform challenges into opportunities for growth and development.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="31">This has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was launched Friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.</seg>
		<seg id="32">One of the resolutions proposed to rename the Central Beauharnois Dam in Adélard-Godbout.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has managed to forge the future&quot;, declared Jean Charest.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In the press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative as this, the program &quot;Roads to the North&quot; by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Addressing the proposed hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest has stressed that it should become operational for 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Between us, but I plan to be there,&quot; he told activists, eliciting from them a huge round of applause.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this fall, it is what the law permits him.</seg>
		<seg id="38">He stressed that his schedule is filled up, notably by a mission to the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions, notably some &quot;constitutional aspirations&quot; which passed through like a breeze: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the &quot;specificity of Quebec in the Constitution.</seg>
		<seg id="40">It also wants Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.</seg>
		<seg id="41">On the opposition side, the outline of the Northern Plan was received with scepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, has brought up again the policy development of Northern Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to her, the Liberal government, when it came into power in 2003, had waived the application.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Had it done so, &quot;it would be more advanced today,&quot; commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (ballot which takes place today), Françoise Mercure.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The ADQ has supported the adoption of the North Plan by the government.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;But what is desired, is that it is not just for show&quot;, said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returned from vacation today.</seg>

		<seg id="1">It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice&quot; (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, which allowed himself last summer to say that Louise Arbor was a &quot;shame&quot; for Canada.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Thus casting opprobrium on the woman who led a struggle for justice and who deserves our admiration also speaks volumes about the entourage of the Prime Minister and on Stephen Harper himself.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Here, we have before us a government that is the only one among all western countries involved, not to have repatriated its nationals locked in the concentration camp at Guantanamo.</seg>

		<seg id="5">The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has gone back on his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Remember, for the record, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, pleaded for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he receives a fair trial in Canada.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This same government turns a blind eye to torture: little does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, doubtlessly forever, after so many years of abuses.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Free opinion - The Orwellian speech Barrick Gold</seg>
		<seg id="1">In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, executive vice-president of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Following an Orwellian logic, it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in order to launch a &quot;transparent public debate&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">While it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, especially in the cases of defamation, they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Not surprisingly, this difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Since, for Barrick Gold, the best way for it to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position?</seg>
		<seg id="6">Regardless of the trial's outcome, the authors and publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal resources, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The tactics, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants with the aim of imposing a settlement that silences the opposition and in addition frightens anyone who dares to think of reopening the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public it should have presented its vision of the facts.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not of baton thumps.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Thus, it would have been sufficient for the mining company to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both call for a &quot;public&quot; debate while at the same time disregarding the views of that very same audience?</seg>
		<seg id="13">In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to high priced lawyers and not to all Canadians: that is a rather narrow view of the concept.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In a democracy, even the critics have the right to speak.</seg>
		<seg id="15">What Barrick Gold does not - or will not - understand is that the public which supports the writers and publishers of Black Canada, does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution-gag (continuing the &quot;public debate&quot;, Barrick Gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of Black Canada demanding them to cease their use of the term ...).</seg>
		<seg id="17">Beyond the Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the continuation of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential for any democratic society.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It denies, collectively, the right to quote from credible sources and debate on the facts and interpretations, which represents the very basis of intellectual work.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects unpalatable to the wealthy corporations in the world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who can do it?</seg>
		<seg id="20">If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.</seg>
		<seg id="21">She has a right to reply.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The academia, to which we belong, has long been managing the debates and disagreements, and resolving conflicts.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Barrick Gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to its claims, it did not want a transparent debate.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It is a loss for academia, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place devices that limit such frivolous practices.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Bush administration and leaders of Congress, both the Republicans and the Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The new version of the 700 billion U.S. dollars plan to curb the financial crisis that rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In particular, it foresees: a better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to executives of companies rescued.</seg>
		<seg id="4">U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following a marathon two-day negotiations.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market,&quot; declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Everything has been done in order to shield the real economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street,&quot; said the Democrat.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense,&quot; declared Republican Judd Gregg.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The negotiations turned into a sprint in the final hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The deadline we had given was the opening of the markets this morning.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Associated late to the negotiations, the two American presidential candidates were rather supportive to the agreement, without failing, however, to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Democratic Senator Barack Obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, particularly those that enable owners to keep their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But these measures are necessary, &quot;he commented on the airwaves of American television.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Asked by another channel whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: &quot;I would like to see the details, but I hope so.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The outline that I read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forwards.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable&quot;, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The plan of 700 billion aims to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts, assets at risk and unsellable U.S. financial institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It comes after a 14 month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprime) before spreading to other forms of more widespread credit titles (PCAA) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This is a group of elected Republicans who had derailed the first draft agreement last week.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It is believed to have come out of this impasse ever since the Democrats have agreed that certain &quot;toxic&quot; shares of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.</seg>
		<seg id="21">To round off the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program, it could introduce new taxes to help recover its investment.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the President deems necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The other payment of 350 billion has to be endorsed by another vote of Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In exchange for its support, Washington will get stakes in the companies it has rescued, earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and severance packages paid to executives of companies affected.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and the Senate on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Voices have indeed continued to be raised against the project yesterday, both in the Republican camp as well as by the Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Obviously, Washington does not hear you,&quot; said while addressing his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Yes, we have a serious financial problem.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yes, solutions do exist.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But not ones that take advantage of taxpayers&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed &quot;the Sceptics' Caucus&quot;, the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but reaches the same conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us: one asks the Congress not to hurry and to examine carefully the way forward&quot;, he said yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="35">At the same time, Europe has once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="36">After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion Euro (16.3 billion U.S.).</seg>
		<seg id="37">The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has indicated that it would renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion Euro (2.9 billion U.S.) in the risky mortgages crisis in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;This is not lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In return, we get the right to vote with the bank and some influence.</seg>
		<seg id="41">It's just something that investors and households appreciate now that uncertain times are ahead.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">Meanwhile, across the Channel, the British government seems about to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="43">According to the English press, the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank Bradford and Bingley, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion U.S.) in real estate loans.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The Spanish bank Santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the British bank.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The Bradford and Bingley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, the British government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.</seg>

		<seg id="1">His beauty and his blue eyes were for a long time his main asset, some would say his weakness.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Did he free himself from this narcissistic mirror, this American actor with the charming smile?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yes and no.</seg>
		<seg id="4">His modesty, his sensitivity and an abundance of talent would have also distanced him from the power register which gives birth to real sacred monsters.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But what a great runner till the end!</seg>
		<seg id="6">Paul Newman, who died on Friday, aged 83, as a result of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema from the years of splendour.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Less monumental than Brando, who he resembled and was a long time sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mixed blood children are often magnificent.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a Jewish German father and a mother of Hungarian origin.</seg>
		<seg id="10">From these European roots were born the glorious faces of the American dream.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without an excessive ego, the ultimate mark of quality.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Because in him is portrayed a country-loving self made man, a combatant in the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 50's studied drama at Yale and attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon after at the cinema.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours Le Mans in 1979, doubled as a sex symbol, albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Also disappearing with him are the shadowy areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the scandals of show business, which have definitely not penetrated the enigma.</seg>
		<seg id="15">An honest man in the noblest sense of the word.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The disappearance of Paul Newman brought vertigo to moviegoers this weekend, while his major roles collide on the black screen of memories.</seg>
		<seg id="17">More than half a century of a seventh American art which is constantly changing scrolls through him.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Rushing back into memory are the charming cowboy in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Closer to us (1990), one evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promises.</seg>
		<seg id="20">So many other Paul Newman have passed into history.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, taken after his death, which really launched Newman in 1956.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This friendly crook in the most brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Billiard player bitter and vengeful in the magnificent The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), he took up again the character on his return in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who in 1987 won him his only Oscar with nine nominations.</seg>
		<seg id="24">This face throughout the ages, it was him.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Him again.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Eras jostle by through his journey.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Young people know him mainly through the cult of Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.</seg>
		<seg id="28">His fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With a last role as the godfather of an Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Unlike several legends of the cinema who have dropped the trade early, Newman has remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its splendour and its concessions.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, &quot;as a living challenge to &quot;underplaying &quot;judging his performances too supported.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The profession has not always been easy with the beautiful Paul Newman to whom roles came for a long time easy as pie.</seg>
		<seg id="33">He played though less often, in his first young roles, marginal characters: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperate men, with his perfect traits reflecting the excesses and the rebellious.</seg>
		<seg id="34">As director, Newman revealed a little known aspect of his modest real sensitivity.</seg>
		<seg id="35">His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">He lost his son Scott to an overdose to whom he dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, out of decency and sadness.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Among the rain of tributes that fell on Newman yesterday, his great friend and former companion in arms Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: &quot;His presence has made my life and this country better.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="38">Generosity, love of life are the features of the vibrant actor just disappeared.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Beyond his legendary career, also erased was a great activist for civil rights, ecology, the independent cinema, a protestor against the excesses of Hollywood.</seg>
		<seg id="40">We saw his mug shots on a lot of jars of salad dressing, sauces, biscuits, and other foodstuffs, judging the process fairly tasteless, although a gag at the outset.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his Foundation for children in difficulty.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Newman, rather than sit on his myth, has remained committed until the end.</seg>
		<seg id="43">He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: &quot;Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortune.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It has been a privilege being there.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">And a privilege for us to have followed the trail of such a lucid and generous American artist.</seg>
		<seg id="46">A model citizen, in sum and i n addition.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag and his companions?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The conduct of the criminal prosecution of János Zuschlag and his companions will be started on 8th October.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The politician and his companions have been accused of taking part continuously and on a professional basis in a fraud causing significant damages, as well as in other criminal activities, including forgery.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to the prosecution, they used the awarded tender funds for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by fake invoices.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The state and municipal funds - HUF 65 million in total - have been shared between the organization Fiatal Baloldal and other people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The methodology - which has been published by the investigating authority, too - was to use bills of costs with unreal performance in order to access the awarded tender funds. This way the associations never met the agreed undertakings.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most of the invoices were false according to the indictment.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The invoice templates were acquired in the Józsefváros market and the round stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The selection of the companies in the name of which the bills were issued was completed on a trip in western Hungary, where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the testimony of the latter one, he was ordered to select pensions and restaurants.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place, and based on this invoice they prepared the invoices to be submitted to the tenders called for by institutes such as the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest.</seg>
		<seg id="11">These were submitted mainly by István Lados and his companion, András Őri, who was responsible for writing the reports required to qualify for the support.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of Lados's &quot;study visits&quot; was to a beer-house.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the invoice dated 2003 and issued by Zuschlag and his companions, the establishment provided food for a group of 90 people, who were members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, as the director of the company states, the establishment does not even have the capacity to provide seats for such a great number of people.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The invoice submitted in the summer of 2002 to the foundation called Jobb Jövőért - which was later renamed to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért - also contained several mistakes in its form and content.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3-room pension in Badacsonytomaj, which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The imaginative fillers of the invoices went also too far when they indicated Pigal Kft. in the documents. It is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information provided to the accusation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Győző Farkas, director of the firm said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned and the invoices were shown to him, he recognised their false nature immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The name and tax number of our company were placed incorrectly on the stamp.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">And he added that, moreover, the invoice had been issued for the accommodation of 100 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 11 rooms, which did not have the capacity for so many people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In addition, the bill included catering as well, though their restaurant had not been in function for long.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The enthusiastic bill-makers were not aware of the fact that the Budapest-based travel agency that they selected organizes foreign tours only, thus the indicated Hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coincide with the invoice issuing practice of the firm.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Furthermore, - as it has been discovered during the investigation - they also indicated VAT on the document in spite of the fact that the transport activities to foreign countries other than the European Union were exempt from VAT.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The degree of VAT, which has been shown in four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the foundation Jobb Jövőért, was also incorrect since the service of the firm should have been increased by VAT of 15%, instead of the indicated 25%. Additionally, the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machine-made invoices, while the reviewed bills were manually prepared.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The invoice-issuers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosecution procedure. This activity was not included in the services carried out by the firm originally dealing with investment consulting.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The fake nature of the bills issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont was disclosed due to formal deviations such as inappropriate billing format and forged stamp.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sportcamp of Kunfehértó, the representatives of which denied having issued the bills.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The forgers did not even pay attention to the fact that the Nyíregyháza based HIB Kft. was under liquidation at the time (2001) when a group from Fiatal Városért Egyesület allegedly had lunch there. The insolvency practitioner denied having issued the document.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Issued consciously</seg>
		<seg id="30">The other group of the invoice-issuers consists of those having been aware of issuing fictitious invoices.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued an invoice of about four million forints for on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták. This invoice was issued to the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért.</seg>
		<seg id="32">According to the indictment, the director of Collab Kft. was encouraged by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to prepare a fictitious invoice.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Biogate Kft. - which is currently under liquidation - also cooperated with Zuschlag and his companions. In 2003 the company provided the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million with no real economic activity behind.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There was no cash flow either since the issued invoices were voided later, but the organizations forgot to indicate this in their documents.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next category of the firms having issued the invoices are those being linked to the defendants.</seg>
		<seg id="36">A good example for this is Iván Kubatov, the delivery representative of the Ukrainian executive director of Delta Trió Kft. having its headquarters in Budapest, but not to be found there, which deals with fuel and vehicle trade.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In October, November and December the company issued several invoices for selling computing devices, in a value of approximately HUF 18 million.</seg>
		<seg id="38">According to the data of the investigation, these bills were purchased by the Kiskunhalas-based Cash Investment Kft., which has been under liquidation since 14 September 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The executive director of the above-mentioned company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="40">According to our information, Kubatov admitted having issued bills to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and received the amounts paid.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons, specifically at the request of Iván Kubatov.</seg>
		<seg id="42">However, neither of these firms operated actually, which the defendant explained by lack of orders.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Still, he could take advantage of these undertakings; for his request, attorney Zsolt Szente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invoices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with Zuschlag, namely for Atlasz and Y-Generáció.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Kubatov provided 15 invoices for the organizations in the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, with a total value of HUF 14.2 million.</seg>
		<seg id="45">According to the prosecution, 10% of the amount indicated on the invoices and the amount of VAT was the share of Kubatov.</seg>
		<seg id="46">He even had Szi-Beri Bt. issue fictitious invoices which were used for the tender of Biztos Pont.</seg>
		<seg id="47">In January 2006 Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a tender to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), which is a non-profit organization of the socialist party.</seg>
		<seg id="48">They were awarded HUF 500.000 each, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.</seg>
		<seg id="49">In order to avoid the fraud being disclosed, they submitted the 5 fictitious invoices issued by Works Team Kft. to TMA.</seg>
		<seg id="50">These invoices were found - during the searches - in Árpád Kemecsei's office located in the Ministry of Education.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Some defendants are likely to confess about the process of the invoice production - as they did at the attorney's department, too.</seg>
		<seg id="52">The most interesting part of the situation could be János Zuschlag's decision on disclosing his secrets.</seg>
		<seg id="53">His testimony so far is not very detailed, and though he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case, he has not done so.</seg>
		<seg id="54">The question is whether he is interested in fulfilling his promise or - in return for the reimbursement of most of the damage (50 million forints), the socialists have struck a deal with him and Zusi would rather take the rap.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Or he might just have taken offence since his requests regarding the alleviation of the conditions of his detention - in other words his being placed under house arrest - kept falling upon deaf ears.</seg>
		<seg id="56">While those who have committed the much more damaging and non-compensated economic criminal activities can walk freely in the streets or wait at their home for the end of the legal procedure being conducted against them, he does not have the opportunity to do that.</seg>

		<seg id="6">The participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a significant role - the complex called striatum, situated under the cerebral cortex, was coming into operation upon the person's defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays role in the &quot;self-rewarding&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Thus, according to the researchers, raising the price can be explained by the avoidance of the violent reaction of the striatum.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In order to justify their theory, the economist members of the research group conducted financial researches as well.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In this research three groups were making bids against someone, under various conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The control group was simply informed about the real value of the certain product and they made their bids.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Another group got a promise of receiving an extra amount of 15 dollars in case of their victory.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The third group was provided by 15 dollars before the auction but in case of defeat, they would lose this amount.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As it seems, the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group &quot;playing for not losing money&quot; were ready to make higher bids than the control group or the group &quot;playing for gaining money&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;These results cannot be deduced from any existing economic theory.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The earlier theories explained the phenomenon experienced at auctions by the delight of victory and risk avoidance.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us to dissolve the contradiction between the two theories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end&quot;, said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic faculty of New York University.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Hepatitis: when shall we turn to a doctor?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Approximately half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection. In Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned among the main causes of mortality.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Although the number of the Hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000, only 7 000 of them are treated properly. The reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Hepatitis is a collective name of different infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Even though there are similarities in the symptoms, e.g. liver inflammation or jaundice, the nature of the pathogens and the caused diseases are different.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms, depending on the type of the pathogens: hepatitis A and E travel through the alimentary tract (for example with infected food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and the other viruses are carried in blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal mucus, saliva).</seg>
		<seg id="6">Those who travel a lot should protect themselves against viruses A and B by vaccination; but there is no vaccination against virus C.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The symptoms of hepatitis A appear 2 or 3 weeks after having eaten the contaminated food; they are accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal problems, nausea.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The next sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye. Additional symptoms are: light coloured faeces, dark urine. Recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Annually and worldwide, 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease, hepatitis B, causing liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The main reason is that only an estimated one-tenth of the infected receive medical treatment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Hepatitis C can also lead to serious problems: it may result in cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer if it is not treated.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness since the pathogens destroy the liver cells over a long time, thus in many cases the first symptoms emerge 20 or 30 years later.</seg>
		<seg id="13">From this point, early prevention, especially regular screening tests have fundamental significance.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In three groups this illness is experienced highly above the average: among people having received blood transfusion before 1991, drug-addicts and those having tattoos.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Currently, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is around 200 million worldwide.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Since the disease can be recognized by routine laboratory testing, it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In case of early recognition, the disease can be cured, the virus can be destroyed, thus infectivity ceases and the induction of cancer can be prevented.</seg>
		<seg id="18">30 September is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by the organizations representing the infected.</seg>
		<seg id="19">It aims to call attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, the causes of its induction and the significance of early recognition.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Does it hurt less if you believe in God?</seg>
		<seg id="1">According to a recent research, religious belief can be used as a kind of pain killer, which could have eased the death of catholic martyrs as well.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;The scientists of Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believing in God on the degree of people's sensitivity to pain&quot;, says the British Telegraph.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 catholic believers and 12 atheists were given electric shock. In the meanwhile, all of them were studying a painting of Virgin Mary.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results showed that the practising Catholics were able to exclude most of their pain.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Due to the brain scanning technology, it turned out that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This was the first experiment in a series of research, which besides academicians includes scientists, philosophers, theologians from different departments of the university.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To be exact, a sparking object providing electric shock was attached to the left hand of the volunteers in the experiment.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The researchers asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings; Sassoferrato's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine from the 15th century.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The researchers expected that - seeing the picture of Virgin Mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state of mind. Da Vinci's painting was selected because of its similar style and calming nature.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The volunteers spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks within four consecutive time periods, while they were looking at one of the above-mentioned paintings.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Catholics described the situation as &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;protecting&quot; which made them &quot;relaxed and peaceful&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the religious painting - comparing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of Leonardo's work.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to psychologist Miguel Farias, taking part in the experiment himself, similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having strong emotional influence on the certain person, even among atheists. It is all about finding the right picture.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;We should find a photo of someone who they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father&quot;, says the psychologist.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings of the research.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;Practising faith should change and often does change our personality&quot;, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="17">After these great results the question now is how Leonardo's or another highly appreciated painter's picture of Madonna would influence the believers' pain regulation?</seg>
		<seg id="18">Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?</seg>

		<seg id="0">You are what you share</seg>
		<seg id="1">On its 10th birthday Google can admit: it is there in the people's pocket, as well as above their head, in the sky. Google knows where people go on vacation, what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are interested in.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In spite of all that, Eric Schmidt, a key person of the company is still not satisfied.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On the other hand, the sceptics who bring it in parallel with Orwell's dreadful fantasy just cannot see the essence of web 2.0.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google was to collect further personal information about the users. It is necessary to maintain the Google founders' original aim, namely: &quot;to create a system for all the information of the world&quot;, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the Google-chief, the company - after having subverted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the information.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Answering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that Google will be able to reply to questions like &quot;What shall I do tomorrow?&quot; , or &quot;What type of jobs suit me best?&quot;. However, software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly simple questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that the terms searched by them are recorded, as well as the IP address used for the search and the pages visited by them afterwards.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Using the 2-year-old Personalized Search function, users can store their own surfing histories, they can review what they were looking for, what kind of links they clicked on before. In the long term, it can provide the users with personalized findings. The function called Recommendations will be based on the same logic: it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;What happens if my personal data are used against me, if it is discovered what I do?&quot;, ask some of the users worrying about the information-monopoly of Google.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is usually the degree of the potential power represented by the company that generates counter reaction in the users, not sense of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or rebellion against authority.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Nevertheless, it has been confirmed that all the searched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to third parties. In such cases nothing protects the privacy of the Internet users.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The best example for that is the concerted action against some Brazilian paedophiles; Google transferred the Brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages, called Orkut. The data supplied helped the government identify several paedophiles.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in May when Google - in association with the EEF electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the FBI: the court confirmed that under no point of the Constitution can the FBI oblige Google to provide any kind of, secretly asked information.</seg>
		<seg id="14">(Nevertheless, - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 50 000 web addresses and 1 000 search terms. However, it could not acquire the individual users' search lists, nor a complete list of web pages and keywords covering a two-month period.)</seg>
		<seg id="15">As it seems, there are controversial opinions on Google. It is attacked by those who fear of giving out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be diminished by using the services provided by Google. Thus, they rather represent the resisting group of conservative multinational companies.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its wild oat including enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users in several countries consider them as the next generation of large companies, a &quot;cool corporation&quot;, in contrast to their opinion about their rival, Microsoft, the creator of Windows and the conqueror of the world, in spite of the fact that the two companies fight for the same goal.</seg>
		<seg id="17">One of the reasons for it can be that Google - unlike Microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications. Furthermore, the open and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant's practice - looks more available, youthful and cool.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Or maybe it is because of the fact that geeks can precisely see the problematic relation between personal privilege and Internet, which is in accordance with the most frequently discussed key expression of the last few years, web 2.0.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Web 2.0 is about a collaboration to intentionally leave traces about our computer activities and exploit the available communication channels. Though the degree of this act can be various, depending on the user, the main point is the same: we show ourselves to the world.</seg>
		<seg id="20">An average young person can open a profile on various public pages such as Facebook or Xanga, they can even link them to other services like Twitter or the music list maker last.fm, then those can be connected to a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, users can create blogs that automatically update the recently uploaded photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.</seg>
		<seg id="21">We can read about several stories like this: the girl - checking the plenty of photos uploaded in the morning by common friends - finds out where her untrustworthy boyfriend spent his previous night. Or another one: an employee might lose his job just because he shared his opinion on the management in his blog. One consequence can be definitely drawn: the definition of privacy has been revalued.</seg>
		<seg id="22">If someone lives an online life, they are what they show of themselves - this is the basic concept behind the behaviour of today's youth.</seg>
		<seg id="23">If someone has something to keep secret or if someone simply just wants to bypass Google's monopoly, it is also possible (e.g. using Scroogle, which also applies the Google search system but purposely leaves no trace behind).</seg>
		<seg id="24">The number of those intentionally not registering to social networking sites is significant. This way they can avoid being discovered, Google's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with huge server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever.</seg>
		<seg id="25">General public is looking forward to seeing what is still hidden by Google.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The company - with its value of USD 156 billion - is worth more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion). In addition, the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencies and services introduced at ever-increasing speed cause Microsoft and several other software developers a serious headache.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Nevertheless, critics can also find the disturbing counterpoints: the management completely rejected the employees' objection, which burst out because the fee of the company's kindergarten had been doubled. The daily canteen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management. However, all these are nothing compared to the fact that Google bowed before the Chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has filtered all search results that offend good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be advertised in advance, only when they are ready to be used. Still, the coming months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world: some people predict that the book and magazine scanning and archiving project of Google will soon reach such proportions that it will have to face the Supreme Court. Others have fear of the Health system, which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us, including our previous medical findings, physicians and problems.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Finally, the fact that Google is building up a genetic database can provide a perfect base material for the sci-fi writers of the next generation. Cory Doctorow's popular novel, Scroogled applies Orwell's style in the description of a future where a person can be pictured terrifyingly well only by using Google data.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Intelligent car imitates the flying of a bumblebee</seg>
		<seg id="1">What could be a better way to advance the development of crash prevention technology than to mimic nature's obstacle detectors?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Let's examine bees, for instance!</seg>
		<seg id="3">In a surprising project that is in progress at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee has given engineers at Nissan a strategic hint at how to design the next generation of crash-avoidance systems.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Based on joint research with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type Biomimatic Car Robot Drive. It is a robotic micro-car that recreates bee characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents collisions altogether.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;In flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which in fact closely resembles our safety shield&quot;, said Kazuhhiro Doi brand director of technology, PR, research and development.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The compound structure of bees' eye plays a significant role, which makes the bees able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In order to recreate the function of a compound eye, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser range finder.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This device detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is instantly translated into collision avoidance.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It takes just a fraction of a second to detect an obstacle, and the car robot instantly changes direction mimicking the movements of a bee by turning its wheels at the angle needed to avoid a collision.</seg>
		<seg id="10">One of the main differences from any current system is that the avoidance manoeuvre is totally instinctive.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;If that was not so, then the car robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,&quot; says Toshiyuki Andoh, manager of Nissan's Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer of the robot car project.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It must react instinctively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner-most layer of the safety shield, a layer in which a crash is currently considered unavoidable.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The whole process must mirror what a bee does to avoid other bees.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It must happen within the blink of an eye.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But unlike a bee, it cannot deviate upwards or downwards or diagonally, only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the wheels can turn.</seg>
		<seg id="16">So in place of the infinite number of ways a bumblebee can avoid other bees, here only the rotation function, the acceleration and the deceleration have been applied as available means of collision avoidance.</seg>
		<seg id="17">BR23C uses lithium-polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which - compared to the lithium-ion version - assures longer lifetime.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to Andoh, what is important is the intelligent instinctive reaction, not the capability for data processing and storage.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The device is supposed to process only a few inputs per second and react on them accordingly.</seg>
		<seg id="20">There is no need for storing the inputs and reacting by the intuitive logic based on the previous manoeuvring data, so it allocates continuously only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.</seg>
		<seg id="21">There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte size memory.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This is the first step of developing the instant collision avoidance technology that, on the basis of Nissan's estimate, can be built into the series-produced cars within 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="23">If connecting the device to the GPS satellite navigation system, an additional application option can be worked out which can help to avoid road barriers while driving.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn up. The draft law, applicable in several instalments, aims to purchase bad banking loans.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In the first round, half of the amount is planned to be spent.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;During the further reconciliations having come to an end on Saturday night, East Coast time, the congressional leaders managed to agree on the debate of several days, which concerned the 700 billion dollar bailout package&quot;, the Reuters confirmed.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We have taken an important step forward&quot;, declared Nancy Pelosi, democratic chairwoman of the House of Representatives, adding that the only thing needed was to work out the written form of the agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The compromise on the package has been supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain as well.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Referring to the results of the compromise, Henry Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury declared: the programme is going to work well and going to be efficient, but further steps are still to be taken. According to Pelosi, it is not about rescuing Wall Street but to turn the direction of the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The written form of the package has been published at 8 pm on Sunday, Washington time, at the opening time of the Asian markets (at 2 am in Central-Europe) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market.</seg>

		<seg id="9">President George W. Bush talked to Pelosi on Saturday night, then the news on the agreement was welcomed in the White House as well.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy&quot;, declared Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The programme differs from the proposal having been first submitted by the Bush-administration with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mortgage-backed securities.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the USD 700 billion can be used in a way that USD 250 billion shall instantly be spent since the Congress is expected to vote on the issue on Monday. One part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage-backed securities. An additional amount of USD 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The programme will be supervised by a separate body with the involvement of the chairman of the Federal Reserve.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be decided by the Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Pursuant to the law, the Secretary of the Treasury is entitled to apply a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other types of &quot;poisonous&quot; credits.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The purchase can be realized on auctions or in a direct way, according to the Treasury.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the worrisome assets will be guaranteed by the Treasury and the companies will pay fees equivalent to the expected damages.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Henry Paulson declared: pursuant to the law, the required assets are provided depending on the situation; it might be an aid of USD 700 billion urgently needed by the American financial system, due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets, or the insurance of those, or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes.</seg>

		<seg id="20">The directors of the troubled banks waiting for state aid should count on that their severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang - will be restricted by the government.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only, limitations depend on the nature of the support provided by the Treasury.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Restriction means that in case the Treasury purchases on auction, surtax is imposed on the golden parachute, unless the ruined bank director is sent to retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the course of buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the amounts of managerial money are not exaggerated.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It must be added that the existing golden parachute contracts will not be amended, restriction applies only to the new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;This is the first time in American history that legal restriction will be imposed regarding the remuneration of chief executive officers&quot;, commented House Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank, of the Democratic Party.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Besides, the government will be conferred with the right of holding acquisition, this way taxpayers' risk will reduce, since they might even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescued bank is recovered.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the Congress within the next 5 years, which specifies how the expected losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Sceptics gave voice for their doubts regarding the plan on both sides, too.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)</seg>
		<seg id="4">Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article The Bavarian revolution is eating up its parents, released in the Internet publication of the left wing news magazine.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to the popular political scientist, the erosion of CSU had began far before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over the office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Christian socialists were doing reforms in Bavaria for long decades - at the present these modern citizens are the ones who turn away.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The beginning of a new era means a problem for all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel as well.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The defeat did not really surprise CSU but a whole process ended on Sunday, a process that had been likely to happen in the last 10 years: the cessation of the indisputable hegemony of a state party.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Ten years ago, in 1998 CSU landed on 47.7 percent, the first time under 50 percent since the fifties.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It happened again 3 years ago, during the Bundestag election 2005, namely in the oft-mentioned Stoiber era.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The reason for it was the consistent modernization carried out by CSU in the province, which eats up its parents.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Sociologists have predicted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong. Nevertheless, secularization, educational results, the settling of Germans from the Eastern and Northern part of the country to the developing regions of Bavaria could not remain without consequences on the CSU loyalty of the voters.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Modernisation comes together with the growth of opportunities and it has its own political consequences.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The right wing is untouched, only the voters of the group have become more self-conscious, critical and wilful.</seg>
		<seg id="15">What is also remarkable is that during the last weeks, mainly classical civil groups were departing from CSU; people of the liberal professions, industrial workers, people with secondary school certificate, people with college or university degree.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The European Equality Summit has been opened today in Paris, which is organized by France this year, representing the Presidency-in-office of the European Union.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In her message that she addressed to the plenum, Lívia Járóka of Fidesz, Representative of the European People's Party called attention for the educational segregation since it is one of the most serious infringement affecting Roma children. Moreover, this is the largest barrier to their prosperity.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The high level conference has been opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labor and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Representatives of the governments, the European social partners and the most significant European legal aid organizations and NGOs from the field of equal opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group in the EP - pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination experienced when applying for a job, Roma people are segregated from the labour market mainly because of their low educational qualification.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Most of the young Roma people do not have a secondary school qualification, and due to the low quality of the basic education only an insignificant part of them can obtain college or university degree&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Járóka also emphasized that education, as a fundamental human right, plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Investing in the early education of Roma children can contribute to strengthening the economy of the European Union member states.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the representative, it is necessary to inform the widest range of people - Roma and non-Roma people as well - about these interrelationships.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The earlier a young Roma student starts attending school, the bigger their chances will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;On grounds of the citizenship right applied in the European Union, the right of quality education must be ensured for Roma people and low quality, segregated education must be eliminated&quot;, added Lívia Járóka.</seg>
		<seg id="12">She also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school desegregation, it is necessary to guarantee an objective- and action-oriented cooperation within the European Union. To accomplish this goal, it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;The vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be eliminated, Roma children must be provided with the opportunities of democratic life so that they could contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights&quot;, demanded Járóka.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Within the framework of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot;, the European Equality Summit - first organized in Berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti-discrimination at European and member state level as well.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Decision About Defeated Huber-Beckstein Duo At The End Of October</seg>
		<seg id="2">Despite ignominious election failure heads have not rolled yet, personal issues are adjourned temporarily at the Bavarian CSU summits.</seg>
		<seg id="3">President of the Party, Erwin Huber and State Prime Minister, Günther Beckstein may still keep their positions, the question is how long grace takes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The destiny of the tandem which have suffered a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided by the extraordinary party congress at the last weekend of October.</seg>
		<seg id="5">However, members of the much criticized duo pictured: they do not insist on their seats by all means.</seg>
		<seg id="6">With this they intended to appease the furious members of the fraction and the basis who were claiming personal consequence because of having lost clear majority one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Five years ago the Christian Social Union - true, lead by Edmund Stoiber who had been at the top of his career at that time - had obtained 60.7 percent but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, the party could reach 43.4 percent only.</seg>
		<seg id="8">CSU had been &quot;absolute ruler&quot; in Bavaria presenting 18 percent of German GDP for 46 years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although conservatives are still considered the most important party in the Southern province, which has key role for the Hungarian economy, they are definitely forced to form a coalition in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="10">As one of the first signs of restructuring within the party, Huber's potential successor, Party Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer becomes member of the small exploratory team beginning investigative negotiations about a possible Munich-based government coalition with liberal FDP as well as with Free Voters representing right-wing values.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Irony of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose intervention against Stoiber had been misused as a coup opportunity and later was handled roughly by the Huber-Beckstein duo, becomes member of the legislative assembly from the party list of Free Voters.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Leaders of CSU are making efforts on stabilizing Beckstein in any way.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Stoiber, who was staying in the background until now, will have an active role in the transition time, the ex-state prime minister and former CSU president claimed 28th September the darkest day of his political career.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Huber made some bitter comments on CDU on Monday, according to him CSU would have deserved much more support from its fraternal party.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Other CSU politicians think that the defeat is a warning to both CDU and Angela Merkel.</seg>
		<seg id="16">After the Bundestag Election due in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor, unless CSU, which was playing significant role in the 2005 national success, is rehabilitated through mutual efforts.</seg>
		<seg id="17">According to the disappointed Merkel, the failure of CSU will not have a negative impact on the coalition government in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Although it is relative: the wounded CSU is not going to be easier to handle and the crisis of the social democrats is going to continue.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Lukashenko-Opposition: 110-0</seg>
		<seg id="1">No opposition representative was elected to the Belarusian parliament during the Sunday's election.</seg>
		<seg id="2">According to Russian observers, the reasons for this are the welfare and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, while Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) explains it as vote counting frauds.</seg>
		<seg id="3">OSCE delegating 450 observers from 43 countries refuses to recognize the election.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade, before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of United Democratic Forces (UDF) had seriously expected that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2006 after the amendments of the constitution, was going to &quot;allow&quot; presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Based on this, UDF desisted from the formerly considered boycott, too.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The background of the expectations of the opposition was that the economically increasingly Russia-dependent Belarus - that had raised a loan to reduce the more and more expensive Russian gas import and agreed to Beltransgas owning gas pipelines crossing the country becoming Russian property - wished to improve its relations with the EU, where visa is not granted for Lukashenko and for a number of top politicians due to the Belarusian political system, which is considered anti-democratic.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The fact that OSCE when having evaluated the election campaign rather focused on positive changes instead of deficiencies - like banning one third of the opposition candidates from taking part in the elections - indicated détente formerly.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, OESC's Monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be present at the counting of votes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the opposition, improvement is still perceptible in the political system: political prisoners have been discharged and Minsk is inclined to confront with Moscow in a minor way by still not recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia which have seceded from Georgia, although Russia - forming a federal state with Belarus on paper - has already been considering the two territories independent for a month.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;We have taken two steps ahead and one backwards, but the most important thing is that dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started&quot;, told Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the opposition candidate of the presidential election of 2006, this dialogue needs to be maintained in spite of the fact that the &quot;power has got afraid of allowing even one opposition member to enter the parliament of no weight&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Seeing the results, the opposition does not plan protesting actions, rather aims to reach voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;We have much trouble with this of course, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, distribution is hindered by the local authorities, but I can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people, amongst the old, too&quot;, said Milinkevich referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result, is considered inappropriate even by pensioners who are officially most supported class of society of all.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Owing to the indebtedness of the country and the increase of trade deficit, the break-down of social security 'similar to dead silence' is a question of time&quot;, Milinkevich claimed.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Russian observers described the elections as democratic, in contradiction to the opposition politician.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Commonwealth of Independent States mission leader Sergei Lebedev told Russian news agency, Ria Novosti: &quot;People believe in actions not words&quot;, so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of Belarusian voters' maturity.</seg>

		<seg id="1">It has never happened in all the history of the Chigi Palace that there were revolving doors at the employee entrance and exit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But as from today, a new measure starts against crafty skivers, against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during working hours.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The novel anti-slackers measure has been presented today by the Public Administration Minister, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Office of the President of the Council, Mauro Masi.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The revolving doors – says Brunetta – are a tool for working better, with a higher productivity, higher presence and more services&quot; specifies the minister.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Now a new season of responsibility and transparency opens.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This is reformism&quot;, underlines again Brunetta.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With the Chigi Palace, the installation in all the buildings of the Office of the President of the Council is complete.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For Masi &quot;the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic viewpoint&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There has been no opposition from the employees, assures the Secretary General: &quot;It has been a process shared by the workers and everybody collaborated&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">To conclude, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A word from Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, &quot;a good cappuccino at seven is blessed&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">During a convention at the High School of Public Administration</seg>
		<seg id="13">of Rome, the minister, afterwards, makes known that &quot;in three months the absences, by public employees, due to sickness have reduced by 50%, that is 60 thousand more people at work in a year&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And adds that it is necessary to make Public Administration more efficient.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Italians, &quot;whose wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 8–10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meantime thousands of public employees have united to challenge the provisions set by the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by Codacons.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;While the minister for Civil Service today parades the figures regarding the reduced absenteeism at work due to sickness – the consumers' association writes – the population of ‘the industrious skivers' is continuously increasing.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In fact, in Italy there are thousands of honest and productive public administration employees that have united to declare war on the illegitimate provisions within the decree&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In particular, at the TAR the exclusion of additional economic benefits for infirmity incurred during work will be contested; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for control medical visits, and other aspects within the new provisions insisted on by the minister.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Everyday, in Italy, at work 2500 accidents occur, 3 persons die and 27 remain permanently invalid.</seg>
		<seg id="2">For 2007, INAIL data confirm that in fact work related deaths have been around 1200.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Figures that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the principal causes of death and causes almost double the deaths with respect to homicide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">To recall the attention of institutions, social forces and information media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil is celebrating in all the Italian provinces the 58th National Day for Casualties of Accidents at Work, institutionalised onto the second Sunday of October.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;The worrying data diffused by Anmil and the very same tragic current news confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at the workplace is&quot;, declares the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the president of Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The head of the State expresses his &quot;deep appreciation of the constant associative efforts for prevention at the workplace, caring for injured workers, assistance of the casualties' families, and the sensitization of public opinion&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Naturally, an indignant ‘enough' has been raised, sincerely shared in front of tragedies that, due to their size, provoke an outcry by the media and the involvement of public opinion but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, whose dynamics are even repetitive&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Napolitano does not conceal that &quot;undoubtedly there's also a resources problem: it's important to invest in training and information.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A particular significance is assumed by the numerous initiatives promoted within the schools in raising awareness of the younger generation that face the work market.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It's a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon, not give up to its serious social alarm, apply and improve the legislative provisions.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On his part the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has underlined &quot;as the phenomenon of accidental deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, that offends the conscience of each and every one of us and imposes on all the institutions a decisive obligation towards urgently ending it&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Data regarding injuries at the workplace seem to signal a small positive trend, but this does not take away the fact that the number of accidental deaths is in any case impressive&quot;, remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;We do not want, in fact, that this ‘downturn trend' is translated into a reduced alertness, because it is just when the attention is reduced that tragedy explodes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;We believe that at a general level little is being done to oppose the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight could be carried on through multiple actions.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is necessary, in our opinion, - underlined Mercandelli – to have more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the worker training, and this should start at school&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;A greater effort is required – he added – with regards to the communication and sensitization of public opinion.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Listening to music at high volume for a prolonged period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players could cause permanent lesions to hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is what a European Commission reports, which in a communication released in Brussels cites the advice given by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) of the EU, published today.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;From this scientific advice – the note reads – emerges that 5- 10 % of those that, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music using portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;It worries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cellular phones at very high volume may unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way&quot;, declares Meglena Kuneva.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;From the scientific findings – carries on the EU spokesperson – a clear risk emerges and we have to react rapidly.</seg>
		<seg id="6">What counts most, we need to sensitize consumers and make this information available to the public.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Besides, in light of this scientific advice, we have to re-examine existent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Brussels had asked the independent scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;Scientists – concludes the EU executive – confirm that there are reasons for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with member states and other interested parties, what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Currently, a European security provision already exists which limits the noise level of portable musical players to 100 dB, but concerns regarding hearing damage caused by an excessive exposure to such noise sources, are increasing.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It is possible to considerably limit the damage by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable musical players listen to music at high volume (&gt;89 dB) for only 5 hours per week, they are already over the permissible maximum noise limits currently in place for the workplace.</seg>
		<seg id="13">People who listen to music under such conditions for longer durations risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is the case for 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the EU.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Today it starts, in March it concludes, in June the conclusions are drawn.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This is the schedule set by the Campidoglio for the &quot;Commission for the Future of the Capital&quot;, which has this morning taken up residence at its new premises behind the Caracalla Hot Springs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will set down the guidelines for Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Once the project has been concluded in March, the Municipal Board and Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, so that in June the strategic plan for Rome can be presented with the official stamp of the Campidoglio and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;The commission is absolutely independent and all political opinions, social, and cultural are represented – underlines Alemanno – It should make proposals for a development plan of Rome on which the political executives, which are always the Municipal Board and Council, can rely.</seg>
		<seg id="6">There is no superposition of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for Rome can be drawn up.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In March its job will be done and it will dissolve, because this experiment should have a precise deadline.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In June – the mayor announces – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If the quality is there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I'm sure there will be in Rome, then its contribution will be fundamental.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Too often politics are overwhelmed by everyday administration and by emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.</seg>
		<seg id="12">On the contrary, we want to look further forwards and further ahead, with a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Furthermore, the mayor of Rome would like to point out that &quot;this commission is neither a useless agency nor an unwieldy bureaucratic organisation: it's absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a cent and it will serve to get reasoning and get involved the best minds that the Capital has to offer&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For Alemanno, in fact, &quot;it's essential to have a strategic reference plan, not closed or inflexible, to permit our city to do an authentic leap in quality, which it really needs, thinking with a united spirit of its future.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A future that, specifies the Mayor of Rome &quot;will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will look further afield&quot; not only with the view of a future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but &quot;also with consideration to the role that Rome could and must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="6">In reality, these are attacks that don't mean a lot: they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the electors' question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; all of them say that Obama will win and by a wide margin.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Even in this case there are those who speak from the heart and not from the head.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A Mississippi newspaper, deep in the South of the United States, wrote an editorial: once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to whom the American patriot will give his vote.</seg>

		<seg id="0">USA, the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the internet, &quot;killer&quot; of the printed paper.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Five hundred American journalists have been asked by PEW Research Centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the future.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Well, nowadays journalists are almost all of them pessimistic regarding their future.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yet, to the information clerks, they have not openly declared to be less worried with respect to credibility.</seg>
		<seg id="4">They don't feel as isolated as they used to.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The problem for American journalists is the money, the money.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Furthermore the cuts carried out in the newsroom, the office where editors work to assemble the newspaper, are a big problem.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It's a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want that traditional journalism as it is understood by the general public is substantially diminished.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A clear but complex pessimism nowadays pervades American journalists.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior executives are convinced that journalism at a national level is going down the wrong road.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Within the local field the executive group is 65%.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Printed against broadcast.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The major publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet, by many seen as the &quot;assassin&quot; of the printed paper.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The &quot;economic pressure&quot; that journalists have felt has increased up to 79%.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology hoping that it &quot;will do some good&quot; for their journalism.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The biggest rift in American journalism nowadays is between those who manage the newsrooms – that is the directors – and the reporters who work for them.</seg>
		<seg id="18">56% of managers at national level are certain that their reporters share their values, whilst at local level the percentage decreases to 23%.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For some this has got to do with &quot;job security&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On a national level, 43% of the managers believe they will lose their jobs within 3 years.</seg>
		<seg id="21">For journalists the figure is 30%.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As for &quot;job security&quot; at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America it varies on a day to day basis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Only 13% of journalists have a work contract.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In an immense nation such as the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals, magazines, radio, TV, and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or leave it.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Directors almost always receive huge salaries, while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and paid insurances.</seg>
		<seg id="26">As for holiday, things get complicated: so many days the first year, so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But American journalists, by their own admission, fall frequently &quot;ill&quot; during the year.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The elite in danger</seg>
		<seg id="1">The phenomenon had already manifested itself a couple of days back with the vote in the Chamber of Representatives against the rescue plan of 700 billion American dollars passed by the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A confirmation was given by yesterday's New York Times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the Republican Party, ever more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, in favour of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead conservative, hostile to&quot;those in Washington» and to the financial world, especially strong within the Central and Southern states.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The soul, to be exact, which has made itself overbearingly alive with the vote mentioned initially.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The latter is but only one example of the changes, of the big changes, that the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or allows to be perceived: not only in the United States but also in all the West and maybe not only here.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Both in the USA as in Europe the crisis seems to act as a catalyst for phenomena which have been in incubation for some time and which in the new climate have solidified and are finally coming to light.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The first of these phenomena is the bringing back up-to-date, the extraordinary re-launch, of the twin category state-sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-nationalisation of the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The crisis, in fact, is a crisis for the financial-banking institutions who have, indeed, strong ties with foreign countries, but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation, in a single state.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This immediately creates a political problem for whoever is in government: and that is how to respond to the difficulties and the protests of those people and those families that, besides, also form the electorate.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In other words the crisis appears to be economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively a national problem.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Political internationalism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say: the clear proof of this is given by the European Union that, divided as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies, cannot decide on a common political path.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And so it is from the government of each single State that all wait for intervention, bailout and re-launching plans, new rules, and especially financial aid: since that when it comes to worst it is only the States that have financial resources, the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And they possess likewise the necessary means, and the legitimate reasons to use them: two resources of incommensurable value, under certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dispose of in an analogous measure.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This new emphasis that the crisis poses on the statal-national element is after all perfectly tuned with the ever increasing importance that the latest economic developments tend to attribute to a coefficient that is very closely connected to that element: territoriality.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the reign of the web, of a technology increasingly more sophisticated, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalised finance was by now destined to dominate the world, we became suddenly aware that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little immaterial such as water, harvests, oil.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Accidentally, all are items that can certainly be transported from one place to another but in any case are tied in an absolute fashion to a well defined space, to a territory.</seg>
		<seg id="16">So that whoever finds himself to be the sovereign , surely holds more cards in his deck than he who isn't, than he who happens to live in a place without crops, oil, or water.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I'm getting to the second novelty that however predicts a split.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably implies Politics, and hence Leadership.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In this respect the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.</seg>
		<seg id="20">On the one hand the knowledge of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for somebody who knows how to handle the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="21">On the other hand a wave of discredit for existent leadership, an economic sort, revealed to be so inadequate and full of grey areas.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And together something ever deeper and in a certain way disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever-increasing number of Western countries.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Rather, it appears to make its way further in vast sections of the population the conviction which before that their actions are the same ideas as of the social elite up till now in favour, their way of feeling and being, their culture in all accepted meanings of the word, to have had their day, and to always be more alien to the opinion of the majority.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In other words, the call for leadership feeds underhandedly a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the managerial class and of the traditional political structures, that manifest itself in the sudden electoral&quot;revolts» or abrupt twists in the collective moods in these last and latest times, from the conservative rise in Austria – Bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).</seg>
		<seg id="25">One gets the impression that the traditional elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, some would say their formats, are finding it always more difficult to comprehend, and hence to represent, that which has been taking shape within the deepest layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening, augmenting, potentially agitating without restraint.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In face of all this, talking about a&quot;rebellion of the masses» as being the order of the day may be frankly exaggerated.</seg>
		<seg id="27">But keeping one's eyes wide open, it is not for sure.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The scientists were inspired by the paws of geckoes, covered with microscopic bristles which succeed in assuring a perfect adhesion to the animal.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The tests conducted on various materials such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the paws of this reptile and at the same time&quot;comes off from walls easier» explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dayton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">WALK ON WALLS? -&quot;This material could be useful as a temporary glue» adds Liming Dai.</seg>

		<seg id="2">After a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunteer developers, with SUN Microsystem supervising at their backs, the new Open Office is revealed to the general public with various novelties: to the welcome screen and to a revisited, less Spartan user interface, are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO version standard.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Attention was also placed on interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is capable of opening documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).</seg>
		<seg id="4">Interesting are some functions specific to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the possibility of importing a PDF file into the graphics module, maintaining the original appearance of the page.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Always on the same track, it is possible to create &quot;hybrid PDF&quot; documents, that join the standard graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Collaboration is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably improved: in the spreadsheet application several users can operate simultaneously, avoiding conflicts on the modifications, in the word processor, each users is assigned a commenting colour to improve recognition during revision.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Some companies are also working on porting some of the functionalities of OpenOffice onto the Web (on the cloud), and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Italian version is available for download at the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version which has been available on mirror sites since Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Besides for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.</seg>
		<seg id="10">On request the installation cd can be sent to your home or workplace.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And if the gimmick of free could be a driving force for the diffusion into houses, it is in the business setting that Open Office is trying the big bet since it can already count on several projects realised within the public administration and schools.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And there are even institutions that offer training services, consultancy, and assistance, ideal small to medium enterprises, which could create more business opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for onscreen typing corresponding to Word; Calc, the spreadsheet application aiming at substituting Excel; Impress, for presentations in emulation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access is the application that consents working on databases; Draw, is the graphic module.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is probable that the predicted figure could even be exceeded.</seg>

		<seg id="0">IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK IS WONDERING, IS ITALY RACIST?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Italy &quot;from a country of emigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants&quot; reluctantly received.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Is this transforming the ‘Belpaese' into a nation of racists? This is what is being questioned in a long article in the New York Times, which has dedicated a lengthy article to the debate on the theme of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for having stolen a box of biscuits.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This case proves what the New York Times calls the &quot;northern paradox&quot;: the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is &quot;most integration and most work&quot; but also where there is &quot;the highest anti-immigrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the Northern League&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">As a confirmation of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants the NYT has also cited the incidents of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino, and Castel Volturno.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Not only.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Even the new legislation from the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is advanced as a paradigm of the change in climate in Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A trend that has been highlighted by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic &quot;Giorgio Napolitano who meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Students victims of high rents up to 900 Euro for a room</seg>
		<seg id="9">The rent market for university students does not know crises.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to the latest investigation by SUNIA, the tenants' syndicate, renting a single room could cost a student up to 900 Euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;The phenomenon has now assumed a very serious trend; up to the point that entire bands of young people are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living which their families would have to sustain – explains the executive from the Research Office of SUNIA, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand by the students has distorted the market so much as to start a process of general increase in rent even for residents&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the majority of cases the rent-offers contain a series of violations: freestyle contracts, unregistered, without rent limits, connected subleases.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to SUNIA special intervention is necessary that, through a revision of the taxes imposed, the prices could be cooled down.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Looking at the details of the investigation, one can see that in Milan, for a bed-space in the Brianza zone, 450 Euro are required; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 650 (Black Band zone), to an average price of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera), and on to a maximum of 900(Victoria zone).</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Florence a bed-space costs on average 350/400 Euro, a room approximately 700.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In Bologna, where the students concentrate themselves in the areas closest to the university, 250/280 Euro are required for a bed-space in a double room, and from 370 to 500 for a single.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Rome in the zone near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) approximately 600 Euro is the asking price for a single room, 450 Euro for a bed-space in a double room.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Slightly lower prices (550 Euro for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).</seg>
		<seg id="19">Savings are only possible by moving to the suburbs: 300 Euro for a bed-space and 450 for a single in areas such as Prenestrina, Centocelle and similar places.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In Naples 300/450 Euro are required for a bed-space, for a single room one spends 400 to 600 Euro, with the highest prices found in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In Bari for a bed-space 250/350 Euro are required, at least 350 for a single.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher impact on the local economy.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In cities where renting to non-EU students is a more frequent phenomenon, such as Perugia, there is a further anomaly: the increase of about 25/30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from Italian students.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Goodbye old Cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historical theatres</seg>
		<seg id="1">Historical cinematographic theatres close in favour of Multiplex.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;A city without cinematographic theatres is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore efficaciously photographs what is happening not only in the large Italian urban centres but also in provincial towns.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The sidelining process of the cinemas, with the birth in the outskirts of large multi-hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single-hall theatres within the central areas of the city, is one of those events that appears unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frequently, it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear,&quot;it is as if a friend is lost, an acquaintance with whom we have shared the way and many memories», observes the director of New Cinema Paradise, the film that twenty years ago gave Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes, and which narrated the poem of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema which, perhaps, has been lost forever.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The numbers provided by Anec, the main cinema-operators association, speak clearly: within the last five years 316 traditional style cinemas have closed shop, and the ones to pay the price were above all the theatres in the principal cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna, and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Among the regions most badly hit by the closures, Emilia-Romagna takes the lead with 82 single-hall cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44), and by Lombardy (41).</seg>
		<seg id="8">And to demonstrate that the arrival of the multiplex is the most responsible for their disappearance, these are exactly the three Italian regions with the largest number of new multiplex cinemas registered: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.</seg>
		<seg id="9">«The Italian business has developed in an irrational way» observes Paolo Protti, Anec's president,&quot;it's useful that new structures are built but it's also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed, because once a theatre in a city closes, not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multiplexes.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators: the previous debit by the state is of approximately 10 million Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It's disgraceful, from the ethical and from the moral point of view, that the government does not respect the existent laws.</seg>
		<seg id="12">To sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million Euro a year are required».</seg>
		<seg id="13">An interesting example is that of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned by the closures, has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote single-hall cinemas both in the historical centre as well as on the outskirts.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Among the foreseen provisions there are tax relief measures in favour of operators and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators can enter in the traffic-limited zone and have special tariffs for road parking and in some car parks.</seg>
		<seg id="15">«It's an initiative which I like» observes Giuseppe Tornatore&quot; and hopes that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting in action other measures.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It's certain though, that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex, traditional theatres have also to improve the sound and image quality, because the public nowadays is more demanding.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The defence of traditional cinemas is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my infancy and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to create &quot;New Cinema Paradiso&quot;, on which I have already been thinking for the last 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto or the Quirinal in National Street both closed by now, there where I have experienced many shared emotions, I turn away so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust».</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was disposed towards conforming municipal interests with those of the Piromalli gang&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The accusations that the magistrates of the Calabrese Anti-mafia Office direct against the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who have been arrested this morning for external contest with mafia association, are very serious.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Also arrested is Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and the public administration offices, and his nephew - a lawyer, namesake of the boss, already condemned for mafia-style criminal association, condemned to repay 10 million euro.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;In contempt of all judicial and moral rules, and common sense&quot;, write the public prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the will to pay consultancy fees to the lawyer Piromalli.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;In this way, it was allowed for the gang – the judges write – to officially penetrate inside the municipality easing the already vast possibilities of controlling and directing the public administration&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The president of the Calabrese local council Agazio Loiero does not hide that &quot;collusions between local institutions and organised crime are numerous&quot; within his region: &quot;there are areas where mafia presence is stronger and more intense than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, there are many local politicians who resist the pressure put on by the 'ndrangheta, heroes who remain clean&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This morning's arrests follow those in July with which the police announced to have beheaded the Piromalli gang.</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always for presumed conditioning between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved from duties of administration of the municipality.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Giorgio Dal Torrione, the mayor of UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He made a scandal out of it when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He brought in cause the then vice-minister of the Interior Marco Minniti accusing him of having plotted everything for political motives, however the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, have explained that the Piromalli gang had even arrived at asking for the variation of the A3 project.</seg>
		<seg id="13">From the interceptions ordered on Dal Torrione, writes the public prosecution, has emerged &quot; a willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="1">It's an immense body, that occupies 70% of the planet's surface and now the big, international energy companies are discovering it.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources being eyed, and subjected to attempts of development, by colossi such as Chevron.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The possibility of extracting energy from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70's, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research was intensified.</seg>
		<seg id="4">When the oil prices went down, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated that in 2007 15 percent of the world's electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas' undulating motion.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power stations.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And then there would be the currents and the tides.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Colossi on the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of Portugal.</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary step.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Two years on there are more companies betting on marine energy and among these, there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Chevron is researching technologies for oceanic energy – a spokesperson for a company associated to the U.S. oil giant has declared to the economy daily Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of collaborating with us&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The cooperation in question regards the obtaining of a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is a significant sign, especially if one considers that right in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has set in motion a plan for new drilling.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Besides Chevron there are Verdant Power Inc. Of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far, even though they are not known in detail, indicate according to the observers an increasing interest.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Technology to be made ready.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its environmental impact.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Till now the plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not appear to create big problems for the ecosystem.</seg>
		<seg id="19">To produce energy on a large scale, however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented.</seg>
		<seg id="20">And the choices are varied: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected between themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The thrust of the waves, which makes the buoys move up and down is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The pressure turns a turbine which in its turn fuels a generator.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The electricity is sent to shore through underwater cables.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For now there are four plants of this kind being planned, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could be used by a military installation.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York's East River.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The water movement when there are the sea tides makes the fans of the turbines go round, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Verdant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorisations to benefit from the energy.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the waves, the tides.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Particular interest, declare the people at the Electrical Energy Research Institute, is deserved at the moment by the potential of tides.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Even though it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and so is more reliable as a source of energy.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It's exactly on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, together with others that overlook the coast, have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009.</seg>

		<seg id="0">&quot;Paroubek's&quot; budget takes money for pensions and sick pay</seg>
		<seg id="1">The fact that the left gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions, sick pay, or building society savings.</seg>
		<seg id="2">And also not enough for interest on the national debt or to cover international judicial disputes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This will bring problems for whoever is in office in the latter half of next year, said the Finance Minister Eduard Janota.</seg>
		<seg id="4">When the social democrats and communists raised interest rates for certain groups, they were relying on the fact that the government would loan money for susceptible expenses, pensions, and sick pay. &quot;It's just a case of postponing the problem, laying a minefield,&quot; says Janota.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Higher interest has to be paid on loaned money, and, at some point, it has to be paid back.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The state does not have much choice where to find it.</seg>
		<seg id="7">If it doesn't reduce social benefits or the costs of running the state, it will have to increase taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For all those that the left just handed out money to: firefighters, teachers, farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And later, their children, too.</seg>
		<seg id="10">People don't have to worry about pensions or sick pay, where 1.8 billion has disappeared from the accounts; they'll get them.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Although, at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt – next year the treasury won't just be 163 billion short, but even more.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will continue to increase at an ever faster rate, as will interest costs.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The state will need money to cover it, and it's no longer enough just to slightly bump up VATs or reduce maternity benefits, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As money has been diverted to several groups of voters, next year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building highways and railways.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These are mostly sections that have been tendered out and are half-finished and cannot be redesigned or made any cheaper.</seg>
		<seg id="16">At the most, conserve what isn't free too.</seg>
		<seg id="17">This means that delaying or halting thirty major building projects and money from European funds is also at risk, warns transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The ČSSD has suggested that the deficit be resolved Solomon-style – it should draw on ČEZ dividends, which are mostly state-owned, and use those to top up the transport fund.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The problem is that the level of these dividends is never certain, and they are certainly not a bottomless resource.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Last year, 18 billion of ČEZ money went into the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Every year, these dividends are used to pay for clearing up ecological damage, topping up the pensions account, or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming pension reforms.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Moreover, according to EU regulations, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But this is not the end of these transfers.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime, to meet the cost of judicial disputes, and even to cover building society savings.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It is still not clear if the state can get by without this money.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It's a gamble.</seg>
		<seg id="27">If we were to lose an international dispute, we'd still have to pay, claims Janota.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The minister will then have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case scenario, reach into the government's budget reserve.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The two-billion-crown State Treasury project, which is already underway, is also lacking a hundred million, and what each office is spending can be followed on-line.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The first stage will start in January.</seg>
		<seg id="31">If the finance minister can't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to be aborted and sanctions will be imposed, warns Janota.</seg>

		<seg id="1">It's not only Krkonoše ski-lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We're getting plenty of visitors to our site.</seg>
		<seg id="5">People are browsing the offers, checking prices, but, so far, are worried about making a definite booking.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;When they call, the first thing they ask is if we think they'll see snow or mud,&quot; says Martin Jandura, who runs the Spindl.Info information web site.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Anyone who wants to spend New Year's Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want, had better start thinking about booking soon.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Those preferring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn are so far just offering week-long stays for New Year's Eve.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I think they'll try to keep that up for a while, but even they will give in and offer shorter stays.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Then there'll be a sudden shortage of vacancies,&quot; estimates Jandura.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter.</seg>
		<seg id="13">What we’re interested in is Christmas week, which hasn't sold out yet.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Half of our capacity is still available.</seg>
		<seg id="15">That's why we've been preparing some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,&quot; said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in the Krkonoše, but there are fewer vacancies.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Another good time for bookings is the first fortnight in February, although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This year, interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Krkonoše.</seg>
		<seg id="19">People are waiting to see if any falls.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there's no snow.</seg>
		<seg id="21">If snow falls on the slopes this week, Christmas will sell out too,&quot; says Schiefert.</seg>
		<seg id="22">On the other hand, the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou has seen better bookings this year than last year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">We're up about 5 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="24">We have the last few vacancies for New Year's Eve and Christmas.</seg>
		<seg id="25">There's a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too,&quot; explains the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The Omnia Hotel, by the central car park in Janské Lázně, is eighty-percent booked up for New Year's Eve.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Yet the newest hotel in Janské Lázně still has half its beds free for Christmas.</seg>
		<seg id="28">January this year has been a nice surprise, as we're already sixty-percent booked up.</seg>
		<seg id="29">So February isn't looking quite so good, but as soon as it snows, then interest in staying in the Krkonoše will definitely rise, says the owner of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For now, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers will have to wait for heavier falls of snow.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Colder weather is forecast for Thursday, so if anything falls, it should be snow.</seg>
		<seg id="32">But it should get warmer again after that, said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec.</seg>

		<seg id="0">USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom</seg>
		<seg id="1">It's almost funny to see how Barack Obama, reputedly the wisest president, is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor, having himself considered him to be the most foolish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush's Iraq scenario three years earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It's not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words &quot;just like in Iraq&quot;, but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush's declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration:&quot;The new way forward&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">While three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as &quot;an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which was recommended by his field commanders, was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It didn't help Bush's reputation, but in objective terms, it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Barack Obama hopes that, in Afghanistan, the miracle will repeat itself.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He was again asked to increase the military contingent by his field commanders, particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McChrystal, who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticise the reluctant gunners in the White House.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The president hesitated for three months, but failed to come up with anything better, and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He managed to squeeze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand, even though he himself was originally counting on 10.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The trickiest aspect of Obama's strategy seems to be his plan to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years. Obama's doctrine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Many doubt that this half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Despite the internecine war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been honouring the treaties.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be relied upon and no treaties are being upheld.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In these conditions, it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare, being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Political institutions, no matter how formally they might be set up, will be nothing more than a Potemkin village in which patriarchal tribal relations will run wild.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Balancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is unusually difficult due to the tricky relations between them, a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Even building an &quot;operational state&quot;, which is the most basic aim of the entire operation, does not seem particularly feasible.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The timing of Obama's strategy is foiled by his voluntarism.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse, and is now on the verge of exploding.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Only a truly romantic soul, totally unaffected by reality, could believe that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of this war for an &quot;early return home&quot; will bring about any miracles here.</seg>
		<seg id="23">From a political viewpoint it is pure irresponsibility setting a date for withdrawing the troops, as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowledgement of an American defeat.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is waning.</seg>
		<seg id="25">European politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Another factor which could radically stir things up is what is going on around Iran.</seg>
		<seg id="27">If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not.</seg>
		<seg id="28">This will need answering when, according to Obama, America orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections, so there's still enough time for him to come up with another strategyif this one turns out to be a total whitewash.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The top management of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive their bonuses in cash this year.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their salary policies.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Instead of money, the group of 30 top managers will receive shares, which cannot be sold for another five years.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The shares can also be confiscated if the managers take excessive risks.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take, said former investment banker for JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The problem lies in the details, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Goldman Sachs has been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion crowns) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will meet with the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering resigning as he does not agree with the government's budget for next year as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is assumed that the budget and also Janota's possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday's meeting.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The budget has also been criticised by Klaus.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He claims the deficit is too high, which is worsening the public funding crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The meeting was announced by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Janota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.</seg>
		<seg id="7">According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is due to sign, the Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals to transfer funds, gave state employees a pay rise, and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">A bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus, and the right on the other, leading to questions about the future of Fischer's interim government, which was agreed on in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the House, essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by Fischer's government in autumn and which it believes should stop the state falling deeper into debt.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today, Klaus, who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it, declared that politicians have long been neglecting a &quot;serious problem,&quot; which is the &quot;unsustainable deficit level&quot; of public finances.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Now, he claims, there is no good solution to this.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties, the president says.</seg>
		<seg id="15">ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should rethink continuing in office.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and the Green Party is evidently no longer working.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In response to this, Premier Fischer described this statement as &quot;strong words.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns.</seg>

		<seg id="1">South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus will tell the world a lot about their country, its struggle and its victories, despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is a story about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The life of the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Freeman said that he had asked ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in Eastwood's film.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Another leading role in the film is played by Matt Damon.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I told him: 'If I'm going to play you, I'll need access to you&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an Oscar for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-slavery movement who eventually himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, and even a god in Evan Almighty, but has only rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mandela.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in South Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was released in 1990 and was then the country's president for four years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Invictus is Latin for 'unconquered' and is the name of a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The challenge was to speak like he does.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unify the country. The newly-elected President Mandela knows that, after apartheid, his nation will still be racially and economically divided.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He believes that he can unite people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who, to the world, are outsiders.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story onto the big screen.</seg>
		<seg id="17">My only aim was to play this role as realistically as possible, said Freeman.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Naturally, the greatest challenge was to speak like Mandela.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park, he would try to meet Mandela, go for dinner with him, and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I found out that when I take your hand, I draw on your energy, it flows into me, and I feel that I know how you are feeling, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For me it's important to try and become a different person.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of rugby to prepare for the role.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home.</seg>
		<seg id="26">I remember ringing his doorbell, he opened it, and the very first thing I said to François Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger on the screen.'</seg>
		<seg id="27">Despite the evident differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts, under Eastwood's direction, Invictus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an Oscar nomination.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up the film by saying: &quot;It was a great story, a very well-made film.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has a 76 percent positive rating.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Strange lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Yesterday the Russian defence ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.</seg>
		<seg id="3">However, it was another unsuccessful launch and the missile, which is known as &quot;Bulava&quot; and should have been the pride and glory of the Russian army, has gradually turned into a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">His repeated presence at tests on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Bulava has generally not lifted off or has been damaged in the air.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Russian newspapers are describing the &quot;Bulava&quot; as &quot;the flightless rocket.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The rocket that doesn't fly but lights up</seg>
		<seg id="8">This, the 13th test, started off according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missile.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Apparently the engine blew up in the rocket's third phase.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This time, the &quot;Bulava&quot; was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was cruising under the surface of the White Sea.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even submerged.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This makes it likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the malfunctioning &quot;Bulava.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Anyway, the Norwegians never had any doubts that it was a Russian rocket.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The generals are defending themselves this time though, claiming that it can't be described as a total failure.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The first two phases of the rocket went well, and the accident happened during the third stage.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Previously, the engines have always malfunctioned during the first phase.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Even though not one test launch has been completely error-free, the defence ministry consider only six out of the thirteen tests to have been failures.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The generals are optimistic about this almost fifty-percent success rate and keep insisting that the &quot;Bulava&quot; will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing a total of 1.15 tons.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The management of the Hyundai car plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cut all overtime.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have declared a strike on Monday.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This was confirmed by the Hyundai spokesman, Petr Vaněk.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The management, however, wants to come to an agreement with the trade union leaders for one Saturday shift this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We can't give up on our production plan, it's essential, so we have proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday December 19th, involving two shifts, said Vaněk.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The website Sedmička.cz wrote that the firm had offered all employees who are to work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This bonus will also be paid retrospectively to those who worked on Saturday November 28th.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to Vaněk, the firm has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Either they'll claim the additional wage for the overtime or they can take time off in lieu on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day, said Vaněk.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Additionally, all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Considering that overtime was the most pressing and thorny question for the unions, as well as for the protesting employees who brought production to such a grinding halt last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for December, said Vaněk.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Until last week, virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours' overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts.</seg>
		<seg id="13">After signing the agreement, the trade unions will call off the strike</seg>
		<seg id="14">Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document, they are willing to call off the strike.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They were also protesting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for cars.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Monday's announcement of the strike, the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production last Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Moreover, this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people.</seg>

		<seg id="8">The work being done by experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague, and the University of Heidelberg, is opening up the way to deal with the rthe virus' resistance.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They have shown that substances known as metallacarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Metallacarboranes are a compound of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.</seg>
		<seg id="11">These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today, and so they may get over the resistance problem.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In their work, the scientists are coming up with new ‘improved’ compounds, prepared using knowledge of the molecular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Metallacarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected to a metal atom, in this case cobalt.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A treacherous and hardy virus</seg>
		<seg id="15">The HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the life-cycle of the virus.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The mature infectious viral corpuscles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by the HIV protease.</seg>
		<seg id="17">If we can stop the HIV protease, we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient's body, the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages (see the diagram) connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Somewhat weaker, but more reliable</seg>
		<seg id="20">The effectiveness of this series of substances against the HIV protease has been tested in a test-tube, as well as its effectiveness against the more immune(resistant) strain as acquired from patients infected with the HIV virus.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The effect of metallacarboranes on the normal strain of the enzyme is not as strong as that of drugs used in clinical practice, although their effect is not diminished against the resistant strains, whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The unique mechanism of the effect and also of its other properties, such as its biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of making other chemical modifications, make metallacarboranes an interesting compound for future research aimed at suggesting new effective drugs to combat HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year's approved budget as &quot;terrible&quot; and said that Premier Jan Fischer's government should seriously rethink its position in office.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The government chairman described the ODS statement as strong words.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Apparently he will take some time to think about it.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and Green Party, was evidently no longer working.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to Nečas, the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit, or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The approaches taken by the ODS and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed, remarked Nečas.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the House accepted the budget for 2010, naturally with the left's proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees, for social services, and for direct payments to farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">he government criticised the social democrats' proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Before the vote, the ODS left the room, complying with the government's wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the provisional budget.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility, while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session.</seg>
		<seg id="4">At the same time, he indicated that he was rethinking his position in office.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks.</seg>
		<seg id="6">If Fischer commits himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD appointees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resignation if the House approves other laws that will increase the deficit, those relating to sick pay, pensions, or the amendment to the Civil Servants Act for example.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Topolánek: Ministers appointed to the ODS have committed no offence</seg>
		<seg id="9">This is a matter for the ministerial chairman Fischer and the government as a whole.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Ministers appointed to the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text report from the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He pointed out that several ministries employ people in under-secretary positions who support TOP 09, which voted against the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Nečas emphasised that, if Fischer were to decide to resign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit, &quot;it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I haven't thought about it, and I'll concentrate on that when the time comes, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, having been elected by the civil democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting.</seg>
		<seg id="16">ODS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nečas also stressed that, on Wednesday in the House, the ODS would evidently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved.</seg>
		<seg id="18">We don't look like orphans, we're not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I didn't notice that my vote was missing.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Back when I renounced my mandate, I knew that the following months would see the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive, Topolánek himself responded.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Invictus by Clint Eastwood will hit American cinemas, depicting part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The role of the world-famous opponent of apartheid is taken on by Morgan Freeman, who was apparently chosen years ago by Mandela himself for his talent.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon.</seg>
		<seg id="4">With the film in cinemas critics and the public</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nelson Mandela</seg>
		<seg id="6">Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18th, 1918 in Mvez, in South Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 received the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There were great expectations, as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa busy preparing for the football world championship, but the media was also rife with worrying news about increasing racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in South Africa, despite the number of objections to &quot;brat-pack&quot; Hollywood stars being cast in the main roles.</seg>
		<seg id="11">However, despite what he says, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.</seg>
		<seg id="12">I had dreamt about this role for many years and prepared for it well.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I met Nelson Mandela many times to, as they say, draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film's grand premiere in Los Angeles.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I think it's good that we can commemorate Mandela and his mission in a film.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is a story about South Africa, but it affects everybody, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In the national rugby team uniform</seg>
		<seg id="17">The film, based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, entitled Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential election campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so long been segregated and, like Nelson Mandela did in 1995, appears in the film in the South African national rugby uniform at the world cup match, which was won by South Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For appearing in the kit, which is an almost sacred symbol in South Africa, fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from the predominantly white spectators and gained the esteem of the white people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Perhaps a football championship can actually bring people together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve is only now becoming apparent.</seg>
		<seg id="22">White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to go to Britain, admitted in a recent interview for LN.</seg>

		<seg id="2">In the morning, a fire broke out in a transformer owned by Čeps at the switching station in the village of Výškov, near Louny.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Six fire engines came out to fight the fire, said the spokesman for the Ústí regional firefighters, Lukáš Marvan.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Originally, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later changed their minds and are putting the fire out using a mix of water, foam, and special fire-suppression agents.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The fire was caused by a technical fault, a short circuit inside the transformer.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Nobody was hurt, and according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the incident will not hinder the safe operation of the distribution station.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been extinguished.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mandátová says that the ruined transformer will have to be replaced with a new one.</seg>
		<seg id="9">She added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that Čeps has been operating, and this kind of fault was a one-off.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to ČEZ spokeswoman for northern Bohemia, Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, there were no power cuts and households, offices and companies were not affected by the transformer fire.</seg>

		<seg id="14">The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These are Michal Hašek, commissioner for South Moravia, Radko Martínek, commissioner for Pardubice, and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Jančura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnál.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The suit relates to the company's attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions.</seg>
		<seg id="18">However, all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways.</seg>
		<seg id="19">So now all three commissioners are attacking us and saying that we're getting the best out of it, while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They claim that we're more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week.</seg>
		<seg id="21">So all we can do is defend ourselves.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It's for slander against Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jančura's great media show, which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It's understandable that I'm prepared to defend my good name and that of my region, and I call upon the other commissioners to do the same.</seg>
		<seg id="27">I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, said Hašek.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Last week, Jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He told Radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for Christmas and would restart it in the New Year.</seg>
		<seg id="30">He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns.</seg>
		<seg id="32">According to Jančura this is illegal and in contravention of the principles of the European Court of Justice.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the ČSSD.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The only threat was that if we don't stop this, we could lose our bus licence.</seg>
		<seg id="35">He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who it was but I'm not going to say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.</seg>

		<seg id="3">But some are saying that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak.</seg>

		<seg id="8">Vaccines free of charge for children born in August</seg>
		<seg id="9">Starting January, there could be free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children born on or after August 2nd.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-vaccinations.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Last year, one in four families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcus.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Parents paid 1600 crowns or more per vaccination.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The youngest children require four vaccinations.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But they save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So far, the state has been paying around 500 thousand crowns a year on all general vaccinations for children.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Subsidised vaccinations were introduced as part of the Janota package.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Pneumococcus causes infections of the middle ear, but also serious infections of the cerebral membranes and blood poisoning.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Pneumococcal infections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every year, according to hospital figures.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Besides the Czech Republic, around 40 countries have introduced general anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Will vaccinations be compulsory?</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some believe that in the future these vaccinations could be compulsory.</seg>
		<seg id="25">As of January, they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The head of the Nahlas civil association, Rudolf Kalovský, says that compulsory vaccinations would be better.</seg>
		<seg id="27">His association has long been promoting pneumococcus vaccines.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It's not completely ideal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">On the other hand, we're happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">I think this is the route we have to take, said Kalovský.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">We're not considering it at this time, said ministry spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks, say doctors</seg>
		<seg id="35">The chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks.</seg>
		<seg id="36">If all children were vaccinated, the number of revaccinations could then be cut. &quot;With vaccines costing so much, we can understand the political decision that vaccinations should be offered on a voluntary basis,&quot; says Cabrnochová.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Experts assume that, starting next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies, not the state.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Doctors will have to buy vaccines themselves</seg>
		<seg id="41">However, practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to buying the vaccines.</seg>
		<seg id="42">According to the original plan, the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Some ministers, however, are worried that the insurance companies could &quot;run wild with health insurance funds&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="44">So doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money.</seg>
		<seg id="45">It is estimated that practising paediatricians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vaccines, which is a lot of money.</seg>
		<seg id="46">It certainly won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.</seg>

		<seg id="17">Ministers said their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant &quot;difficult decisions&quot; but insisted that 60% of the burden of extra taxes would fall upon the top 5% of earners.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Treasury minister Stephen Timms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a &quot;drop in the ocean&quot; compared to what was needed.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;These are large numbers. They will deliver for us this halving of the deficit which is absolutely essential over the next four years,&quot; he told the BBC.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mr Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the turn of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="21">However, Labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to borrow and how quickly he deficit is cut - have been questioned after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In his statement, he said the economy was likely to contract 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while borrowing would be £3bn higher than earlier estimated.</seg>
		<seg id="23">'Blown opportunity'</seg>
		<seg id="24">The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's &quot;debt crisis&quot;, said projected borrowing of £789bn over the next six years was unsustainable.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mnisters had failed to lay out a credible plan for how they would pay this back, they added, &quot;cynically&quot; ducking tough choices until after the election - which must be held by June 2010.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;They have not included anything of significance they are going to do,&quot; said shadow Treasury minister Philip Hammond. &quot;They had an opportunity to do it and they have blown it.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="29">Labour insist that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts unlike under Tory proposals which would see the deficit cut faster and further.</seg>
		<seg id="30">But the Lib Dems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit, arguing the plans were &quot;built on sand&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation increase in some disability benefits next April - would leave the chancellor open to accusations of electioneering as the money may simply be clawed back the year after.</seg>
		<seg id="32">However, Labour insist the extra help is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.</seg>
		<seg id="33">'Phoney budget'</seg>
		<seg id="34">Although ministers did not publish spending details for beyond 2011, economists said it was clear the squeeze on public spending would only begin to bite in the medium term.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Can Islam Be French?</seg>
		<seg id="2">Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State.</seg>
		<seg id="3">AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate—and are integrating—into one of the continent’s most avowedly secular societies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s last work, &quot;Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves&quot; (2006), an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Mr Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious canvas.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="7">He has spent months in the mosques, schools and institutes which now provide France’s 5m-6m Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls &quot;Islamic spaces&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?</seg>
		<seg id="10">Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?</seg>
		<seg id="13">It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them household names, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and academic.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.</seg>
		<seg id="16">They are not having the argument all their way.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a French or European Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts—advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.</seg>
		<seg id="20">But accommodation requires give-and-take on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">He questions how far French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely guards laïcité) are really committed to pluralism.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He suggests that Muslims are probably getting a rawer deal than the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a &quot;tightening of the value-screws&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say, &quot;Yes, but not yet.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="14">In his new book, &quot;After the Ice&quot;, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a gripping glimpse of how the future may turn out there.</seg>

		<seg id="20">Satellite surveys and large arrays of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful addition, but much is still done by hardy individuals camped out in the cold.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Mr Anderson looks in on the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by trickles of briny water which gets squeezed as it freezes.</seg>

		<seg id="7">Now an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way to host events dedicated to the people in the military and victims of terrorism.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Worcesters also founded a non-profit, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event across other states.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pa.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase, and transport the wreaths.</seg>

		<seg id="10">The detention of an American contractor may likely raise tensions between the Castro brothers Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been pursuing a &quot;go-slow&quot; approach to improving relations with the island.</seg>
		<seg id="11">News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times Friday night.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will reciprocate.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Cellphones and laptops are legal in Cuba, though they are new and coveted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 a month.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.</seg>
		<seg id="4">But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As a result, they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They were regarded as a sting operation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That's why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The official said the men were undeterred and were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The organization's recruiters act as gatekeepers, keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny, analysts said.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But they are also considered enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst with the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods.</seg>
		<seg id="15">If you're trying to sink someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlmann said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The model is one that has become far more Web-based.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Protesters said as many 100,000 people joined in the event, but police estimated the count was closer to 25,000.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near a group of government buildings downtown.</seg>
		<seg id="4">On a day when little happened in the U.N.-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked across the city holding banners in English saying &quot;There is No Planet B&quot; and one in Spanish declaring, &quot;The Earth is Saying, 'Enough.'</seg>
		<seg id="5">Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native country of Peru made me aware of the heartbreaking issues the country is dealing with due to the impacts of climate changes that are already occurring.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big march -- to pass on the word and to appeal to the world's leaders to deliver a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done, there is no way around it anymore.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The police kept the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily on the grounds that they had either worn masks or carried pocket knives.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Those activities are banned during demonstrations under Danish law.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to one bystander, who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks, activists sporting masks and black outfits set off several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is nearby several ministries.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They were lobbing them by the buildings, he said, adding they began as flares but were followed by &quot;a couple big explosions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Test data reveal stubborn racial gaps</seg>
		<seg id="1">Last week's federal report card on math achievement was a welcome piece of good news for D.C. public schools.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Although the District still lags far behind the country's top-performing systems, the report card showed fourth- and eighth-graders making strides at a faster pace over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white students both locally and nationally.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The average scores of white D.C. fourth-graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers' rose just three points, from 209 to 212.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.</seg>
		<seg id="6">African American progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dipping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size wasn't large enough.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The picture across a six-year stretch isn't more encouraging.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The gap separating white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the District was given, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).</seg>
		<seg id="10">Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely narrowed to 58.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled largely by white students who are already high achievers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It would suggest that we've raised the aggregate by treating those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troublesome, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in the District.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I'm not jumping up and down about a two- or three-point spread, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A frequent critic of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of the test scores is that the city's middle schools are in desperate need of attention.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Clearly, you always want to see the plus signs, and I respect that.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But what's scary is we're not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.</seg>
		<seg id="18">This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, targeted to students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who didn't master the basics of reading early in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Everyday Mathematics, a K-through-sixth-grade math curriculum emphasizing games and real-life experiences that was brought to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I just think we have to keep working at bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Others say that the NAEP's results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap.</seg>
		<seg id="22">There is a sort of rough-edged dilemma here for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.</seg>
		<seg id="24">So the targeting may yield political repercussions that go against that important agenda.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But the rub, of course, is like other urban superintendents, she's trying to hold on to the white and black middle class.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can get an excellent public education.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one essential element to closing the achievement gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.</seg>
		<seg id="29">You have to get up near 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to agreement with his teachers' union last year on a 185-day year, which he regards as &quot;a marker&quot; for seeking a bigger increase in the next contract.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud wheeze.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped off and blinked for a moment at the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawns.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Graciela's parents had barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Yet as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition runs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of awestruck visitors than of enthusiastic prospective students.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Yes! This is where I'll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they'd entered the science building.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when told of the school's low professor-to-student ratio.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Pennsylvania college was the seventh the kids had visited on their three-day tour, and by now they had completely absorbed its intended message: The question is not whether you're going to college.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The question is where.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educations they need to enter the middle class.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In fact, one in five of these &quot;second-generation&quot; Hispanics graduates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an outsize role in the country's workforce.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Those who study high achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But mentoring programs also can play an enormous role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her make it to college -- particularly if those efforts are sustained over time.</seg>
		<seg id="16">When you're looking at low-income kids whose parents don't have the experience and the skills to help them navigate through the system, any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latino students.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We need to think about providing a supportive network for these kids from preschool all the way on through high school.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that concluded Saturday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil firms are poised to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.</seg>
		<seg id="3">American companies walked away with stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The only one that submitted a bid lost.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Two American companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The meager representation of American oil giants in Iraq's opening oil industry surprised analysts.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, you have Asians and Europeans leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It will be a long time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Concerns over security, underscored by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely kept American oil companies from venturing more forcefully in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.</seg>
		<seg id="11">U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms, have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they don't respond to shareholders.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have cultivated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.</seg>
		<seg id="15">State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two major fields.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Companies pre-selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field.</seg>

		<seg id="1">An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have been killed when a pair of missiles tore into their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They were driving in a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official with Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The official said suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of the &quot;totally demolished bodies.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">Local authorities were unable to verify the victims' identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner who ran the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was engaged in plotting throughout the world, said one senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He took strategic guidance from al-Qaeda's top leadership and translated it into operational blueprints for prospective terrorist attacks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly through al-Qaeda's ranks and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He may not be a household name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar strike killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operatives.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The tempo of strikes by CIA-run drones has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a tally by the Long War Journal, a Web site managed by a nonprofit group.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The United Nations' top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan's U.N.-backed presidential election.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The U.N. envoy said that he supports the surge but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a military drawdown beginning in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We need to accelerate the buildup of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The commitment has to be long-term.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants aiding Afghanistan's political transition.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The surge on the military side has to be copied on the civilian side, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Eide said he was not resigning but simply fulfilling a commitment he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He said he wanted to serve notice to U.N.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now so that he would have time to find a replacement.</seg>
		<seg id="11">What I've said is that you better start looking for a successor, Eide said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between a departure of my predecessor and my arrival.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to U.N. officials.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The officials say he has been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian national who recently headed the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peacekeeping operations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Eide's standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Eide denied the allegations, but he said the accusations by Galbraith -- who was fired -- &quot;certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a great degree of skepticism with regard to international interference&quot; in the election.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that donate to the Afghan mission, saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly spent.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations undercut his ability to bring in talent.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The U.N. rules are such that I have only been able to recruit a single person since May, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="21">That is catastrophic and can't continue.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose &quot;significant additional sanctions&quot; on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a query from a soldier about the likelihood of such a development. ¨</seg>
		<seg id="4">One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is the inherent unpredictability of war.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said that &quot;a package of incentives and disincentives&quot; would be needed &quot;to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons&quot; because &quot;their people will suffer enormously&quot; from sanctions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &quot;credible&quot; consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, it indicated that it would return to talks on restraining its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Frankly, Iran's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think, has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iranians, Gates said.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Obama has set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he turns to reviewing other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &quot;crippling sanctions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called &quot;baseless and unfounded allegations&quot; Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers &quot;in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to Iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, particularly over boundaries, property rights and revenue-sharing.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in U.S. plans to cut the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Gates also sought to allay Kurdish anxiety about the pending drawdown. U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.</seg>
		<seg id="19">We will not abandon you.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that &quot;Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children&quot; and &quot;One more baby means one more tomb.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city's low birthrate and aging population, abruptly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.</seg>
		<seg id="3">We have already given all our time and energy for just one child.</seg>
		<seg id="4">We have none left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son.</seg>
		<seg id="5">More than 30 years after China's one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed &quot;little emperors,&quot; a population crisis is looming in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The average birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect, according to the U.N.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Population Division, while the number of residents 60 and older is predicted to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. That is far above the global average of about 20 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Last year, people 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birthrate was less than one child per couple.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that fertile couples need to have babies to &quot;help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Shanghai is about to be &quot;as old -- not as rich, though -- as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A gradual easing</seg>
		<seg id="13">Written into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Couples who violate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical strain on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In addition, many couples have had sex-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007, they toned down many of their hard-line slogans.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Almost overnight, posters directing families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It has also pledged to provide emotional and financial counseling to those electing to have more than one child.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The response has been underwhelming, family planning officials say.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Disappointing response</seg>
		<seg id="27">Although officials in one rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban districts report no change.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Huinan township, with a population of 115,000, for instance, is still receiving just four to five applications a month.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don't want more children.</seg>
		<seg id="31">They want to give the best to their first, she said.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But like many Chinese, they have only the scant medical and life insurance provided by the government.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Without a social safety net, they say, the choice would be irresponsible.</seg>
		<seg id="35">People in the West wrongly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Yes, we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the problem is not just some policy.</seg>
		<seg id="38">It is money.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitating.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Wang, the human resources administrator, said she wants an only child because she was one herself: &quot;We were at the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We are not used to taking care of and don't really want to take care of others.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, put it more bluntly.</seg>
		<seg id="43">For the dual-career, middle-class parents who are bringing the birthrate down, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Today's 20- and 30-somethings grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Even one child makes huge demands on parents' time, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="46">A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Then there are the space issues -- &quot;You have to remodel your apartment&quot; -- and the strategizing -- &quot;You have to have a résumé ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best preschools.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="48">Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once, Chen said, but not twice.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Ours is the first generation with higher living standards, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">We do not want to make too many sacrifices.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The text, which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Forged by a U.N. ad-hoc working group, the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term.</seg>
		<seg id="5">And it provides a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output, and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, boiled down a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the U.N.'s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as &quot;the big picture.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">It shows the outlines for a possible deal, in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Together, the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Still, Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week.</seg>
		<seg id="12">U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America's top climate negotiator was either lacking &quot;common sense&quot; or being &quot;extremely irresponsible&quot; for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="16">With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet, with China and the United States feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it's not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adviser for Conservation International.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has &quot;put political pressure on the entire political process,&quot; in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal.</seg>
		<seg id="24">High-level officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the Bella Center's halls to closed-door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out, and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The intensity is only building: nearly all of the key ministers are now here, and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We're getting into the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The heavyweights are coming.</seg>

		<seg id="1">At 5.13 on Monday morning a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 140mph as it streaks from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter service out of London.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He hopes that the new service will eventually plug Britain into an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Neglected backwaters would become thriving commuter towns, business travel times would be slashed and the shift from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions as well as easing congestion on the roads.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In theory, the three main political parties buy into this vision.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental harm may yet put the brakes on Britain’s high-speed lines.</seg>
		<seg id="8">High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will hand its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, The Times has learnt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the environmental impact may be contentious.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In open country, the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route.</seg>
		<seg id="12">HS2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network running north.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The favoured option being put forward is a Y-shaped configuration in which a single high-speed line would run up to the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.</seg>
		<seg id="16">A single line would run into Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;It looks like it is going to be the best-performing option,&quot; a railway insider said.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Once complete, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be cut to 2 hours 40 minutes.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour at present.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The proposals would allow trains to travel at 250mph, making the British network the fastest in Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The initial track is being designed to take trains 400m in length capable of carrying 1,100 people.</seg>
		<seg id="22">As many as 18 could operate each hour on a London-Birmingham line.</seg>
		<seg id="23">That means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers an hour would be needed.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Given space constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should proceed, but lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a general election.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Even if he does put the wheels in motion, the network would have to be built in sections.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Trains would at first be forced to run off high-speed lines on to the existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.</seg>
		<seg id="29">That is seen as the crucial tipping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Alan Duncan, the frontbench Tory MP, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year towards the cost of an orangery he built at his constituency home.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The party’s prisons spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living &quot;on rations&quot;, increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He was allowed to charge the extra interest, totalling hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been queried by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members’ expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the claims &quot;couldn’t be cleaner or simpler&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Houses near by have sold for almost a million pounds.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Last year he added a conservatory to the house, described in plans as an &quot;orangery&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Neighbours described it as a &quot;glasshouse for entertaining&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Duncan was not required to make any reference to the increased borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage arangements.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The committee cleared him last month of breaching the rules after an investigation into his expenses.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In 2004 Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 a month.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The interest rate on Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage did not change in that time, suggesting that all the increase was to fund the £75,000 borrowing.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The RBS standard variable mortgage rate went down from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remains.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The latest document release by the Commons authorities show that Mr Duncan was continuing to claim £1,250 a month this May.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Mr Duncan lost his job as Shadow Leader of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive &quot;on rations&quot; after the expenses scandal.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;Basically, it’s being nationalised, you have to live on rations and are treated like s**t.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">He said: &quot;I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fraction based on what is proper.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And I could claim the whole bloody lot, but I don’t.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first challenged over his expenses in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this &quot;could be considered excessive&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="23">An activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 over three years.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Asked about the increased mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said: &quot;It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by Legg.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">He added: &quot;There is no issue of ducking and weaving or pushing the rules or anything.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It is absolutely straight down the line, within the rules, authorised and everything.</seg>
		<seg id="27">It just couldn’t in many ways be cleaner or simpler.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Beach huts in Brighton have found a new lease of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, using Christmas carols as their theme.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The event started on December 1, with visitors allowed to view the latest hut from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, with mince pies and mulled wine laid on for free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Carols chosen so far include I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the hut features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary clergyman within the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyond.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;We want to make religion more relevant to people in a post-Christendom society.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? It’s my feeling the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive agreement in the fight against global warming around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.</seg>
		<seg id="2">At least thirty thousand people, according to police, and a hundred thousand, according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital outside the United Nations climate conference, which is tasked with reaching an agreement by Friday that will enter into effect on the 1st of January, 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="3">For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish climate conference president, the increasing number of climate rallies around the world, illustrated by these protests, has contributed to making the 'political cost' of a failure in Copenhagen very high.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the main procession, when a group of 300 protesters, clothed entirely in black, broke shop windows with paving and hammers, observed a reporter from the AFP.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Riot police provided an immediate and unhesitant response.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Police announced a total of 600 to 700 hundred arrests, with most, they report, being members of the 'Black Blocks'; small ultra-violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the protest organisers, reported conditions whereby hundreds of protesters were arrested &quot;without discrimination,&quot; highlighting that a hundred of them &quot;were still detained in the street on Saturday night&quot; handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Having left the Parliament, the procession headed in an orderly fashion towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were to take place.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The protesters stopped about 500 metres short of the building without trying to enter.</seg>
		<seg id="10">A stage had been raised to receive the expected speakers before a candlelit vigil, in which the former South African Archbishop from Cape Town, Desmond Tutu would be taking part.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The majority of protesters had arrived by coach and train from the major European cities, but many Asian protesters, including some Chinese and Korean, were also present, as well as those from Africa.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Around 3000 people, mainly clad in sky blue raincoats, had formed an initial rally in Copenhagen during the morning, called by Friends of the Earth, who were planning &quot;blue waves&quot; for &quot;climate justice&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">We are marching on the streets today to demand reparations of the ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist in the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We cannot continue to tell ourselves that there is time left, assesses the singer from Benin, Angelique Kidjo.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There are rivers drying out in Africa; water courses, where it is possible to walk and never was before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">For the first time in the history of Climate Diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has brought itself closer to environmental organisations.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The French Eurodeputy, José Bové, a face of anti-globalisation, explained that he has come to Copenhagen to &quot;connect climate justice with social justice&quot; : &quot;Today there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the anti-globalisation fight.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to numerous islands, which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming, had kicked off the protests.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to organisers, some 50 000 people took to the streets in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, brandishing banners about the benefits of solar energy.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In Hong Kong, Djakarta, and in Canada, rallies of several hundred demonstrators were also formed to demand more forceful action against climate change.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In France, the protests organised by the &quot;350&quot; network brought together several hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseilles (in the South), Lille (in the North), Bordeaux (in the West), and Lyon (in the East).</seg>

		<seg id="3">The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Attendance was at 58% a few hours before closure, according to Abkhazian electoral Commission officials.</seg>

		<seg id="6">The five candidates in the running, among whom the existing president, Sergei Bagapsh, all categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia, which has condemned the holding of the vote.</seg>

		<seg id="9">Other than Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of the territory's 216 000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.</seg>
		<seg id="10">After separating itself from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which saw the loss of several thousand lives, Abkhazia is trying to show, by means of this election, that it is ready to join the international community.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared Svetlana Kvarchia, a 54-year-old historian, who confirms having voted for Mister Bagapsh.</seg>
		<seg id="12">She was among the voters who came to the polling station in an attractive white school building with several palm trees at the front in the capital, Soukhoumi.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The question of the Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential debate, in this region gifted with a lush landscape on the Black Sea.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Vast billboards showing Mister Bagapsh beside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are dotted around this small territory of 216 000 inhabitants.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In Gali, in the West of the country, the Chief of District, Beslan Archba, reserved a very warm welcome for the Russian officials who came to oversee the voting.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We, the Abkhazian people, are thankful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support from Moscow, and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, while raising his glass of vodka.</seg>
		<seg id="18">For their part, the opposition represented in the vote by the former vice-president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticises the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, such as the one giving Russia control of the Abkhazian rail network for the next 10 years.</seg>

		<seg id="1">French Education Minister, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview to be published in the French Paper On Sunday (JDD) that History and Geography were &quot;reinforced&quot; by the secondary schools reform, despite them no longer being obligatory subjects for the French technical Sixth Form.</seg>
		<seg id="2">From now on, first year pupils will have four hours per week, and the same programme for a common shared culture, states Mr. Chatel.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to the minister, &quot;We need to get out of this hypocrisy&quot; because, he says, &quot;the 'S' course of study is no longer the science course&quot;, but &quot;more generally, it is a magnet for the stronger pupils&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 'ES' and 'L' courses cannot remain inferior choices behind the 'S' course, he continues, highlighting that &quot;I have not heard many historians or academics expressing indignance at the absence of History-Geography in the technical Sixth Forms either.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Saturday, an IFOP (French Public Opinion Institute) poll appearing in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French people disapproved of the Government project to terminate compulsory teaching of History-Geography in technical Sixth Forms. Many academics and teachers also criticised this suppression, as have the left and some right-wing representatives.</seg>
		<seg id="6">On the other hand, the minister added that there was &quot;no question&quot; of eliminating the 'S' course philosophy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Luc Chatel also defended the teachers' education reforms, just as 16 organisations (students and associations) called for a day of protest on Tuesday to demonstrate against the project, which, in their opinion, sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 2nd year Master's (M2), an entry exam focusing on the candidate's discipline will be required at the start of the year, and an acceptance exam testing their capacity to teach will be held at the end of the year, the minister explained.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Furthermore, they will cover in-class placements throughout the M2 year, and will then be in front of pupils for a year as student teachers.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If you add up all the placement work proposed before the exam you already end up with more presence in front of students, which equates to over 300 hours, he continued.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Finally, the minister indicates that he will be putting forward &quot;the individual's right to education; something that does not exist in national Education&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school map &quot;by 2012&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At Normale Supérieure (one of France's top schools), experts have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate</seg>
		<seg id="14">Fifteen minutes to talk about what is at stake at the Copenhagen summit: that was the challenge taken up on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the intergovernmental group of Climate Evolution experts (GIEC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure in rue d'Ulm (Paris).</seg>
		<seg id="15">Jean Jouzel, Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the conferences entitled &quot;Ernest&quot;, a day composed of a series of 15-minute lectures from experts, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP reporter.</seg>
		<seg id="16">We wanted to do something to catch people's attention and make them want to find out more, explained one of the day's organisers, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, outside the conference; this having been named after the name given to the fish in the school's pond.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We choose around twenty lecturers among the experts in their field and the more charismatic ones are selected, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="18">On the subject of global warming, &quot;we could go on for hours, but we can also cover the key objectives in a few minutes&quot;, Jean Jouzel told the AFP, who made his presentation without notes, but with graphical aids, to an audience of around fifty.</seg>
		<seg id="19">This is part of our scientist's role, he emphasised, hoping that listeners will remember that &quot;the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely solid scientific case&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The video footage from the conferences will be available online on the school's website starting the 15th of December.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The next &quot;Ernest&quot; day is planned for February, followed by others on a bimonthly basis.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Prison guard unions called for a &quot;general rally&quot; on Friday to demand payment of their bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays, having seen it pushed into January for budgetary reasons.</seg>
		<seg id="2">FO-pénitentiaire (2nd prison guard union) has requested that staff, who are not on duty, demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to &quot;block&quot; them, in order to &quot;expose the theft of their earnings&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union in the profession) calls for them to &quot;unite in general, rallying at the various prisons, to show a strong turn-out&quot;, condemn the non-payment of &quot;overtime, night-shift bonuses, Sunday and holiday pay&quot; in December for their work in October as &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">And the first prison guard union, Union fédérale autonome pénitentiaire (UFAP/UNSA), &quot;calls for general rallying (…) to re-awaken the discontent and anger&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The penitentiary administration's Management and the Justice Ministry explain that overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget, but assures that the outstanding balances will be settled in January.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Chancery stated near the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I am not ignoring the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this communication.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I have asked the penitentiary administration Management to put in place, without delay, a set of measures to ensure that this situation, caused by a poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours, does not repeat itself in the future, adds Mrs. Alliot-Marie.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The December pay packet will therefore be slim, except for management staff, who benefit from the so-called target and position-related bonuses, critics the UFAP/UNSA, saying &quot;budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is an absolute scandal, complains the inter-regional union from Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott &quot;all meetings and convocations&quot; until further notice.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Staff will not be putting in Sunday or holiday hours if the October ones are not settled in December, and the same goes for overtime, threatens the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne trade union.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded, but our staff numbers are not, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's salaries, judges the CGT-pénitentiaire de Bordeaux.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being worse off than others.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But in any case, the balance is not there, observes Jean-François Forget, general secretary of UFAP.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Johnny Hallyday was re-operated on in Los Angeles due to significant &quot;lesions&quot; after an operation in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on in the night between Wednesday and Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted &quot;lesions resulting from the operation&quot; for the slipped disc undergone in Paris on November 26th, his press office announced in Paris, adding that the lesions had &quot;warranted a repair operation&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The singer's press office, however, wanted to be reassuring, stating that the situation was &quot;under control&quot;, while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to RTL, partner for the singer's first tour, however, Johnny Hallyday may have been put into an artificial coma to avoid &quot;pain and complications&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">It will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient, once he has at least one eye open, added RTL.</seg>
		<seg id="6">When questioned by the AFP, the press office neither confirmed, nor commented on the information.</seg>
		<seg id="7">RTL also claims that &quot;according to certain sources&quot;, no drain was fitted after the first operation in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The rocker had been operated on for a slipped disc at the international clinic at Parc Monceau.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The operation, scheduled several days in advance, had been carried out by the neuro-surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artist circles.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He was not available to comment on RTL's information on Thursday evening.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Following the operation that he carried out on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was taken on Monday to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital for an infection stemming from the operation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The singer, Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through &quot;a bad patch&quot;, but assured everyone that he had &quot;no worries&quot; about the rocker, who is a &quot;fighter&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was crazy, because taking a 12-hour flight after that kind of operation is not realistic, said Eddy Mitchell.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, stating that Johnny Hallyday &quot;was reacting satisfactorily to the antibiotics&quot; and that the infection was being &quot;contained&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Camus had also said to have spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and not to have noticed any signs of worry.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But health problems for the singer have only multiplied since he was hospitalised for nine days in July after a fall on his yacht.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Two months later, to the surprise of all, Johnny Hallyday had revealed having had a &quot;minor colonic cancer&quot; operation, then a slight infection.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Frenchman, Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal-holder in the long course 2009 World Championship, pulled off an international title for a distance he particularly favours, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short course event in Istanbul on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The first day of this competition, where full-length swimsuits are permitted for the last time, has seen only three world records beaten, whereas a wave of them was expected.</seg>
		<seg id="3">One record was improved on by the Hungarian, Evelyn Verraszto, 200m medly, and the two others by Russia in the 4x50m medly relay.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A regret for Bousquet, who had his sight set on the 50m freestyle world record, for which he holds the long course title (20.94).</seg>
		<seg id="5">In one of the two high-profile swimming events, the 50m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who made his mark with a time of 20.53 in a final, where ten swimmers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Bousquet bested the Croat, Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian, Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to reduce the world record time (20.30) as he had envisaged.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One can always dream of better, and I had actually stated that, if the world record was in my reach, I would certainly attempt it.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Like Bousquet, the vast majority of swimmers were in polyurethane swimsuits, which will not be permitted starting the 1st of January.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Having unleashed 238 world records since February 2008, these swimsuits will end their epic story in Istanbul, which had also seen the first ones in 1999, during the same competition.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The use of these swimsuits did not assist the German, Rome's long course two-time world champion this summer, Paul Biedermann, on this occasion, where world records were at stake.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The young swimmer did not succeed in reducing the record he currently holds in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but did, nevertheless, make an impression by achieving his second personal best time (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian, Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane, Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).</seg>
		<seg id="12">I did not give it my all in this race.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I knew that I could not achieve a world record, but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Lobintsev will be a strong rival in the future, explained Biedermann.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A Roman sarcophagus panel, which had notably belonged to the French writer, Emile Zola, fetched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, a significantly higher figure than was estimated, announced art auction house Sotheby's.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This front panel, measuring two metres in length and 63cm in height, dating back to the 3rd century AD, was valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The marble &quot;depicting four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece; there are only five of them in the world&quot;, Florent Heintz, vice-president of art auctions for Roman and Egyptian antiquities, had explained to the AFP on Tuesday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It was sold among around a hundred other lots.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The auction is still going on, but this lot is certainly the one, which has got buyers bidding most so far, commented Sotheby's spokesman to the AFP, Dan Abernethy.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble piece dates back some time.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The panel remained in the famous collection of the Borghese family in Rome for nearly 300 years, then it successively appeared with the French actress, Cécile Sorel, who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris mansion, then Paul Reynaud, a minister in France's 3rd Republic and briefly the Council's chairman before Marshal Pétain's accession to power.</seg>
		<seg id="8">That left a grey area of about fifty years.</seg>
		<seg id="9">By searching the Louvre Museum's database, Florent Heintz discovered that the panel was part of an &quot;Emile Zola inheritance&quot; opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; and the series of &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mexico judged on Thursday that conditions were no longer suitable for the transfer into its territory of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, who had been refused safe passage by the coup-installed Government.</seg>
		<seg id="2">At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with president Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the potential options for carrying out this transfer are not suitable, declared the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Having arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican Government plane returned to its original location, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migrations.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Coup Government had wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and had requested a foreign asylum to allow him safe passage to.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the incumbent Head of State and an invited guest.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Coup Government &quot;has again met with failure by wanting me to give up my duties (...); they wanted me to resign&quot;, Mr. Zelaya told radio Globo on Thursday, through which he often makes himself heard, since the beginning of the political crisis, which has so far lasted five months in this country of Central America.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I could stay here ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president while playing a few chords, having taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for the last two and a half months.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Mexican Embassy presented us with a request for safe passage, but, unfortunately, we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Coup Government Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matute, had declared on Wednesday on Honduran HRN radio.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I am not requesting asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview on the Telesur channel, based in Caracas.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Any departure from Honduras would have to be as the president of the Honduran people, he had emphasised.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The rumours of Mr. Zelaya's departure had, on Wednesday, mobilised the partisans of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian Embassy, where military forces reinforced their position.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the Coup Government's position.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This demonstrates the marginal character of this Government in relation with international standards, he asserted.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Zelaya, who had become closer with the socialist Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on June 28th, the day he had organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-election, going against the views of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Exiled to Costa Rica, he had made a surprise return on September 21st and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy.</seg>
		<seg id="16">If he comes out, he will be arrested to answer to charges of &quot;high treason&quot;, which the Law accuses him of, according to the Coup Government.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The Coup President, Roberto Micheletti, has managed to organise a presidential election on the 29th of November to replace Mr. Zelaya.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial vote, which was recognised by the United States, but was contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Three days later, Congress voted by a landslide against Mr. Zelaya's return to power for the remainder of his term up to January 27th.</seg>

		<seg id="2">We have learned from witnesses and from police that, according to the investigation's initial findings, the attacker, aged 28, appears to have struck an eighty-year-old with two knives for reasons that remain unclear, in or at the front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Having sustained severe wounds, the elderly man, born in 1929 according to the police union, Alliance, died from his injuries in the hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then began attacking a couple, including a pregnant woman.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The husband, aged around thirty, came between them and was wounded.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The first two victims, gravely wounded, were admitted to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old man died.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The days of the other injured person may be numbered, as vital organs have apparently been affected, according to police sources.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The pregnant woman was subsequently taken ill and was hospitalised &quot;in a state of shock&quot;, according to one police source.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, fled into the street along Boulevard Jean Jaurès.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He is reported to have wounded two passers-by, apparently at random: one thirty-year-old, and one forty-year-old, the latter severely.</seg>
		<seg id="11">By the evening, the scenario remained unclear.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was armed with two butcher's knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained Arnaud Pressé at the scene, an officer from the Alliance union of Hauts-de-Seine.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Several passers-by, including some youngsters, attempted to overpower the madman, according to witness reports collected by the AFP.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I saw a guy of about thirty with a green jacket.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Three youths tried to intervene.</seg>
		<seg id="16">They could not manage it, because the guy was well-built, recounted Alberto, a server in a nearby bar.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A crowd fell on him, including a town policeman, who broke his wrist, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Still on Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, outside number 61, two town policemen, one of whom was the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were injured by punches, according to police sources.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The events took place on one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main streets, where many local businesses operate.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Some passers-by came to tell me that there was someone injured outside.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put the person in the recovery position, then I noticed a severe wound on the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Five minutes later, a second person arrived, aged around thirty, with knife wounds.</seg>
		<seg id="23">National police officers were the ones who arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification documents.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The case will be brought to the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office by the region's police service for Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).</seg>
		<seg id="25">The madman was taken to a hospital on Thursday evening.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The lawyer of the Franco-Polish film director, Roman Polanski, called again in Los Angeles on Thursday (California, western United States), for the abandonment of proceedings against his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of &quot;The Pianist&quot; cited grave errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal of California's second district.</seg>
		<seg id="3">I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now, declared Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge, who was dealing with the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, &quot;sends chills down the spine&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to him, judge Rittenband -- since deceased -- is said to have spoken with one of the prosecutors, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison, before passing sentence -- constituting a serious error in procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This discussion had been revealed in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot;, the words coming straight from the prosecutor in question, David Wells.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, Mr. Wells had eventually declared that he had &quot;lied&quot; to the author of the documentary at the end of September.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In the event of the court's refusal to abandon proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Prosecution, for its part, has re-iterated its argument, already formed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Polanski did not present himself in court.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States before his sentence had been passed for &quot;unlawful sexual relations&quot; with a 13-year-old minor.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He has not set foot in the United States since.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The deputy prosecutor for Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, therefore declared that Roman Polanski &quot;must be present at the hearing&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">For this case, are we trying to send the message, not just to (Roman Polanski) but also other defendants, that it is ok to flee? asked Mrs. Asayama.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In her view, the filmmaker &quot;is asking a favour from the court, while at the same time showing disregard for its authority&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their verdict -- has also emphasised &quot;that there are other alternatives to fleeing&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request that proceedings against Roman Polanski be abandoned.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called once again for an end to the proceedings.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Reminding that her client can no longer stand to be harassed with every resurfacing of the Polanski case, she added: &quot;No one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thirty two years is enough&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Roman Polanski was arrested on the 26th of September in Switzerland on an American warrant.</seg>
		<seg id="20">After more than two months behind bars, he was put under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, pending his possible extradition.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday, in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the NASDAQ dropped 0.03%.</seg>
		<seg id="2">According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points, whereas the NASDAQ, with a technology predominance, fell by 0.55 point to 2 190.31 points.</seg>

		<seg id="5">It remains within a narrow margin; trading volumes have become very weak, and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators, which &quot;have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery&quot;, summarised Charles Schwab's analysts.</seg>

		<seg id="1">After a month-long trek across South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World are preparing to enter the final straight on Saturday to make their dream come true: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.</seg>
		<seg id="2">During this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi-final.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Miss Japan, Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar, and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected Miss World Sportswoman or also Miss World Top Model during their African stay.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It was a real whirlwind.</seg>
		<seg id="5">To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town is extraordinary.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I saw so many things and I have so much new experience, said Miss of Sierra Leone.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).</seg>
		<seg id="8">I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The experience was fascinating.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I am pleased to have been able to live it twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For the young Russian, her second visit to South Africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re-discovery &quot;of landscapes in this country that take your breath away&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings, and safaris, the Miss candidates are concentrating on the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this vote, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become stars of Bollywood.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not all about appearance.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We are ambassadors for our countries and I want to return home with the crown, asserts Miss India with a broad smile.</seg>
		<seg id="16">According to organisers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and, of course, in swimsuits.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The show will be presented by Angela Chow, an ethnic Chinese television presenter, the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean, and an officer from the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.</seg>
		<seg id="19">South Africa showed that it could welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better, affirms Julia Morley, president of Miss World.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The candidates went on safari, as they did last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and sampled the local cuisine.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Exceptionally, they also met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Unusual for a head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Their most beautiful memory will probably be the World Cup draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.</seg>
		<seg id="24">I have mixed with people I never thought I would be able to approach.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, assures his son, David, on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles, where he was to be by his father's bedside, who has been in hospital for several days.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The news is very positive.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He is very strong, all will go well, declared his son, David Hallyday, to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT).</seg>
		<seg id="4">The singer's son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading &quot;without delay&quot; to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on November 26th in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The singer was &quot;put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered&quot;, indicated the press service.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Johnny Hallyday had already been put in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on the 26th of November in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from the operation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">His wife, Laeticia, went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School, where their daughter Jade is enrolled, to attend a school performance, observed an AFP photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Head of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The producer vehemently brought into question Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neuro-surgeon, who operated on the singer on the 26th of November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="11">They told us it was carnage.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Los Angeles surgeons said they were aghast, declared Mr. Camus.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Jean-Claude Camus reckoned that Johnny Hallyday had &quot;left far too soon for Los Angeles, with the Paris surgeon's authorisation&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I had this doctor on the phone in person, and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip, which shocked me, as I, myself, have had two slipped discs, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Shortly before, on RTL, he had indicated that the singer apparently &quot;had left without a drain or anything&quot;, following his Paris operation.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in artistic circles.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma, following a cerebral haemorrhage.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, he is also a doctor with a notorious reputation, convicted by the Law on several occasions, in cases of medical liability, as well as for fraud and tax evasion.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors' governing body, accused him of being &quot;a man without scruples&quot;, who &quot;regularly&quot; has to answer to the governing body's Council, and who is &quot;far from reputable&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="22">After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an announcement on Friday through his solicitor, David Koubbi.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The latter indicated that the operation had &quot;gone perfectly well&quot; and that post-operation tests returned &quot;normal&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The operation &quot;was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not required a drain to be fitted&quot;, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In any case, the singer's tour, for whom health problems have been multiplying since the summer, would seem to be on hold.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Clearly, resuming the tour on the 8th of January [in Amiens] as planned seems very soon, declared Mr. Camus.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The UDF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its acronym</seg>
		<seg id="1">The UDF alliance, controlled by François Bayrou's Democratic Movement (MoDem), reacted on Friday to the buy-out bid made by the New Centre's president, Hervé Morin, for the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances, threatening legal action otherwise.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Hervé Morin announced publicly that he intended to recoup the UDF acronym, ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage, having extended his hand to the Left.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Defence Minister, whose party is partner to the UMP, had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC's national Council.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In support of his move, he received backing from deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP switched to NC), who claims his ownership of the UDF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="5">However, Friday evening, the UDF Alliance's office, headed by François Bayrou's friends, who do not plan to give up possession, has come out of silence to launch an attack against the deputy, ordering him not to use the acronym, and to transfer the trademark's ownership to them, otherwise threatening legal action.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the last few days, you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the UDF acronym, the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, as well as the senator, Jean Arthuis, from the centre Alliance.</seg>
		<seg id="7">You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website's homepage the movement's name, the New Centre, and to follow it with the slogan: today's UDF, remark those who signed the document.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As you are well aware, you have no right to the use of the acronym, explains the UDF's office, requiring that the NC remove &quot;immediately any mention of the UDF name from all material, and from (their) internet site&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He also requests that Hervé de Charette &quot;transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If you failed to do this, the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of UDF members were respected, warn the document's signatories.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In their communication, they specify that the UDF &quot;is a political movement in its own right since 1978&quot; and points out that Mr. Morin and his friends had &quot;made their choice&quot; to leave him in 2007 &quot;to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to establish the UMP&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The New Centre, according to them, has therefore no right to the use of the UDF acronym (Union for French Democracy).</seg>
		<seg id="13">They also remind that the UDF's last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the MoDem for three years, and for the creation of an office charged with defending &quot;the material and moral interests&quot; of the body founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.</seg>
		<seg id="14">As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, &quot;when he registered the trademark&quot;, he had &quot;not been a UDF member for three years&quot;, but, in fact, with the UMP.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This incident is turning into a major offence, they state, before adding ironically about the NC's strategy that: &quot;in our opinion, in politics as in real life, it is more dignified to make one's own name rather than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no right to&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Liliane Bettencourt Case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for &quot;abuse of weakness&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Nanterre tribunal decided on Friday to bring François-Marie Banier to trial to ascertain whether, as the daughter of billionairess Liliane Bettencourt is accusing him, he profited from the eighty-year-old's weakened mental state to despoil her of some of her fortune.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The photographer, 62, known for his photographs of the stars, will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for &quot;abuse of weakness&quot;, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro fine.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case, which is turning into a worthy family saga involving one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are torn apart, while at the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, the 15th Magistrate's Court has also ordered a combined expert medical opinion of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, to be led by three doctors.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an exam, at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nanterre court at the time of the investigation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by the 10th of March, 2010, stating, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt could have found herself in a weakened state and at which times.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I think she will submit to it.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I will talk with her about it, declared Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the exit of the hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, congratulated himself on the court's decision.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is excellent news (…) The expert opinion will prove that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we should be protecting, he affirmed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and all-round artist, whom she accuses of profiting for years from her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts, or works of art.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As far as she is concerned, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers a long-standing friend.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As the court on Friday was due to examine the admissibility of the case brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleas from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an unveiling of intimate family matters.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer cited three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to her solicitor, in which she expressed having suspicions about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In the letter dated from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: &quot;could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">I have been unable to speak to Françoise since her marriage&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For its part, the Court in Nanterre has again ruled that the plaintiff's claim was not admissible for action, all the more so after a judge supervising guardianship refused her request in the past few days to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Liliane Bettencourt &quot;is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings, she is not under protection and does not have a guardian.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Nobody needs to act on her behalf&quot;, affirms the Public Prosecution's representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Court determined that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers's claim had taken place.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence?</seg>
		<seg id="1">If nothing changes in the way France's biggest enterprises are run, our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in vain…</seg>
		<seg id="2">For over ten years, the Management's attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution: employees should be made to adhere to &quot;values&quot; dictated from above just as it was in the past, when products dreamed up by the factory's engineers were dropped on the consumer.</seg>
		<seg id="3">By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation, the marketing revolution put the strategies for conquering markets the right way up again... even if authoritarian temptation to impose products, which are disconnected from the preferences of the consumer tend to resurface regularly!</seg>
		<seg id="4">A demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Demobilisation gravely compromises the development of an organisation's strategic functions, notably in R&amp;amp;D, but even more so in competitive intelligence.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Indeed, CI &quot;demands from all sides concerned (...) a proactive approach and a long-term vision&quot;; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For this reason, we are calling for a management revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise's concerns alongside consumers.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys</seg>
		<seg id="10">Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Unfortunately, I fear it will not.</seg>
		<seg id="12">- Firstly, because I have witnessed that, when faced with a new situation, any organisation will arrive, after many detours, at doing chiefly... what it always does!</seg>
		<seg id="13">- Next, because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures.</seg>
		<seg id="14">- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Coming from the top technical educational establishments, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.</seg>
		<seg id="16">They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviourist theory, which has recently been re-awakened by the &quot;neuro-sciences&quot; of the United States that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the Media.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In this way, by suggesting that &quot;levers&quot; [sic] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance, which is unsuited to the world of today.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Identify and quantify mobilisation factors</seg>
		<seg id="19">In contrast, the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It consists in the integration, within all management strategies and practices, of a fundamental admission: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams, their ambitions, and their plans.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Currently, only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation.</seg>
		<seg id="22">These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-determined consensus of opinion, which allows them, by means of this perceived view, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans.</seg>
		<seg id="23">By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and turn their management of resources &quot;the right way round&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="24">They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The American Right paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of a &quot;just war&quot; against the enemies of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the Prize to Obama on October 9th, were this time giving the presidential speech their applause, lead by Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 elections.</seg>
		<seg id="3">I liked what he said, declared Mrs. Palin, right-wing champion of the Republican party, to the daily newspaper USA Today, adding that she had herself touched on the topic of war that is &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; in her memoirs, which have just been published.</seg>
		<seg id="4">War is, of course, one of the last things, which Americans want to get involved in, but it is necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We must stop these terrorists over there, she affirmed.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Mr. Obama, who has inherited the two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, in Iraq and Afghanistan, applied himself on Thursday in Oslo to justifying resorting to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Another one of Mr. Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, concluded that the president had done &quot;very good work&quot; in Oslo.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I found his speech to be really very good, approved the former Speaker in the House of Representatives, who had particularly valued the mention that &quot;Evil does exist in the world&quot; in the presidential discourse.</seg>
		<seg id="9">From certain viewpoints, I found this speech to be of historic significance, declared Mr. Gingrich, during an interview for the radio show &quot;The Takeaway&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The former representative, considered by some a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration of the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see &quot;a president from the Left&quot; remind the Noble Committee members &quot;that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if resorting to force had not been an option&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">For Michael Gerson, a former writer for George W. Bush and re-converted columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama has given &quot;a very American speech&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As well as presenting himself as a &quot;world citizen&quot;, as &quot;he always does&quot;, &quot;he spoke like an American President&quot;, reminding Europeans &quot;that they live in a security bubble, which they did not create and they are doing little to preserve&quot;, declared Mr. Gerson.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a hawkish character from the Bush era, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, described the speech as &quot;drab, turgid, and uninspired&quot; on the National Review Online's website.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Following three marathon sessions of negotiations, transport unions and the TLF, the only employer's organisation to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries.</seg>
		<seg id="2">During the signing on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau was &quot;delighted&quot; with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After a second night of discussions, negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swift signing of the agreement's text later in the morning.</seg>
		<seg id="4">And this, despite three employers' organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) having slammed the door.</seg>
		<seg id="5">However, it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11am for everyone to be in agreement, and for the text to be signed at 6pm.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The disagreement &quot;would have been very damaging for the companies&quot; and &quot;it looked like it might threaten the end of year festivities&quot;, Mr. Bussereau stated.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The document allows for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest ones (in local and regional road transport), and a 2.9% increase for higher ones (international transport).</seg>
		<seg id="8">Hourly rates, for those on lower pay, &quot;go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is not much, but we have come a long way, explains Patrice Clos (Worker's Union).</seg>
		<seg id="10">This evening we will give the order to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There may, however, always be a few difficult ones, who remain uncooperative, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, paid tribute to &quot;a good agreement&quot;, even if it was &quot;difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones.</seg>
		<seg id="14">It is a common sense agreement, respecting the workers, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised it as &quot;a historic agreement&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As for Richard Jaubert (CGT), he described it as &quot;an acceptable compromise&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3% and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010, which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month's pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mr. Bussereau reminded everyone that &quot;a 100 million euro cut in employers' charges&quot; had been the subject of a Government amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009, voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Government will ask that the Senate vote on it &quot;in the same timeframe&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The signature from the TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation, and secondly, to the whole profession, subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It will be done &quot;in a very short time&quot;, assures Mr. Bussereau.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The opposing employers' organisations can only delay the process.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The FNTR called it a &quot;sham&quot;, because the 100 million euros &quot;had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table, not with the aim of a two-sided review, but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eaters this Christmas, deplores the UNOSTRA.</seg>
		<seg id="24">For the OTRE, the agreement risks &quot;digging the graves of a large number of the sector's SMEs over the next 12 months&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport link in France, are set to continue over the weekend, as a meeting on Friday, the second day of strikes, between the unions and the RATP management have left their pay demands unmet.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Saturday and Sunday, on this critical weekend of shopping before Christmas, trains will only run between the hours of 10am and 8pm, with just one out of two trains running on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation), and one out of four outside the central section.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The operation of the interchange with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Galeries Lafayette, who welcome 200 000 customers every day, were delighted by the fact that &quot;the RATP is making efforts to assist the department stores&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The RER A runs through the Parisian conurbation from West to East.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The RATP segment runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On Friday, approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times, with almost no trains at all during off-peak periods, as planned.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As on Thursday, there was no trouble with crowds on the platforms, as Parisians had gotten themselves organised.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thus, in the early hours, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less busy than usual, notably because of the absence of school and college students.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up &quot;an hour and a half earlier, to be sure of arriving on time&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Saint-Lazare station did not see any overcrowding, the SNCF stated, having planned for additional support staff and police officers.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The RER A trains operated by the SNCF to or from Cergy-Le-Haut were departing or arriving from Saint-Lazare station, where they link with the metro.</seg>
		<seg id="13">New general meetings for strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, seen as &quot;poor&quot; by the unions, of a meeting with Management held on Friday afternoon.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The RER's director proposes to negotiate a specific agreement for the RER A on all aspects, working hours, career paths, etc…</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is not what the drivers, who are demanding the bonus they are owed, want, according to Thierry Garon (SUD).</seg>
		<seg id="16">The RATP has even put its offer of bonuses on hold, the CGT complained, pointing out that the management &quot;could not be bothered to resolve the problem, whereas road transport and the SNCF both have it done and dusted&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for &quot;a wider review of the conditions of practice for the profession&quot;, the RATP elaborated.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Prompting the unions to remark further that the company &quot;did not care about its weekend passengers&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">During the morning, some 150 drivers invaded a works council meeting at the company's seat in Paris.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That is when Management, which had until then refused to enter into any discussions during the strike, had suggested the meeting &quot;in a motion to calm the situation&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The dispute is threatening to extend to RER B on Tuesday, following the submission of an advance notice by the UNSA and the Indépendants groups.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, with a 30-euro variable band (CGT, FO, CFDT, SUD, Indépendants) and are complaining of the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The RER drivers, all in the later stages of their careers, are paid a gross salary of 2200 to 2700 euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonus pay for split shifts, Sundays and holidays.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a verdict on Friday for the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurd party, a decision which was immediately followed by angry protests within the Kurdish community in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The decision is likely to greatly complicate the Government's work, as it has just recently made positive gestures towards the Kurdish community in an attempt to resolve a 25-year old conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become &quot;a hotbed of damaging activities against the State's independence and its unfailing unity&quot;, the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the disbanding, Mr. Kiliç indicated, adding that 37 of the party's representatives, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and the deputy, Aysel Tugluk, have been banished from political life for the next five years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity, from which both Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk benefited, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The DTP occupies 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).</seg>
		<seg id="7">Its leaders had warned prior to the verdict that the representatives would leave Parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affiliation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Appeal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying &quot;directives&quot; from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and in many countries.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Many observers believe the DTP serves as a legal political shop window for the PKK rebels.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The party maintains, however, that it has &quot;no organic links&quot; with the PKK, but refuses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The court's verdict comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures, reinforcing its rights in an attempt to quash Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.</seg>
		<seg id="12">DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the Anatolian Southeast, where a great number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PKK's head, Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into clashes with police in the last few weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As soon as the Law made its announcement, a thousand protesters gathered before the DTP's buildings in Diyarbakir, the Southeast's main city, populated mainly by Kurds.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Police forces fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, as demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Following the verdict, Mr. Türk declared that the Law's decision would &quot;deepen the despair&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Turkey cannot resolve this [Kurdish] issue by banning a party, he told the Press.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Government, a party rooted in Islamic influences, also condemned the decision.</seg>
		<seg id="19">We are opposed on principle to the closing down of parties.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It does not solve anything, declared the Energy Minister, Taner Yildiz.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This decision puts a blowtorch to the Government's democratic olive branch, comments political analyst Ahmet Insel.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.</seg>
		<seg id="23">On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the North of Turkey three days earlier, one of the bloodiest in the last few months.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The snow can come</seg>
		<seg id="1">A really hard, frosty winter, that is what Wolfgang Brauburger is wishing for.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Not because he wants to make a laughing stock of people, says the the head of the FES winter road maintenance service.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But so that his employees can try out and learn every facit of their vehicle's technology.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This may be the case for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.</seg>
		<seg id="5">More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Here, the FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As soon as Frankfurt is blanketed in snow and the temperatures drop below zero, 20 so-called &quot;A Routes&quot; are serviced by large-scale distribution vehicles, explains Brauburger.</seg>
		<seg id="8">These include, for instance, main traffic roads and through roads, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstrasse.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But also fire roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and roads with slopes, such as Atzelbergstrasse.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The service of the FES starts at three in the morning</seg>
		<seg id="11">The approx. 1,040 km would, if necessary, have to be gritted with wet salt, which has better adhesive properties, within no more than three hours.</seg>
		<seg id="12">That is why the FES start at three in the morning, &quot;so the routes are free by the time commuter traffic starts&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It becomes difficult when it only begins snowing at 7.30 am.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then we are faced with a problem, says the head of the winter road service, &quot;because nobody is prepared to make way for the gritting vehicles&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Only then, unless it continues to snow, is it the turn of approach and connecting roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The last priority are quiet side and minor roads.</seg>
		<seg id="17">That is where complaints are made, knows Brauburger.</seg>
		<seg id="18">At five in the morning, the footmen of the FES set to work, and dangerous areas and passages are cleared.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The FES can usually not attend to all bike routes.</seg>
		<seg id="20">There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges, in particular from 10 pm until 4.30 am, says Brauburger.</seg>
		<seg id="21">As slippery ice quickly forms on them, the gritter sets off as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees centigrade.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Where required, it is also called out by the police.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The cradle of the dinosaurs</seg>
		<seg id="1">Tawa Hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, standing two metres tall and with a length of 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs, had a longish skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.</seg>
		<seg id="2">If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not be anything special.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features, reports Sterling Nesbitt and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin in Science magazine of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The animal lived about 215 million years in what is today New Mexico, which was back then in a dry zone of the super continent Pangaea at the equator.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It reveals a great deal about the relationships, the spread, and the features of early dinosaurs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In 2006 Nesbitt and the other palaeontologists started an excavation on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;On some days we found dozen dinosaur bones, that is exemplary for sediments from the Triassic period,&quot; reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The scientists identified some bones quickly.</seg>
		<seg id="10">During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five creatures.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Find confirms theories on early dinosaur history</seg>
		<seg id="12">The name Tawa comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.</seg>
		<seg id="13">For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional find: &quot;Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic period are extremely rare. Mostly, only individual fragments are found.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Other dinosaur researchers do not quite share this enthusiasm.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories on the early history of dinosaurs.&quot; says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for instance.</seg>
		<seg id="16">According to current doctrine, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, for which reason the classification of these primal dinosaurs is highly contentious.</seg>
		<seg id="18">As such, the experts debated, for instance, when the saurians split into the three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and birds, the four-legged sauropods known as the &quot;long necks&quot; and their relatives, and the plant-eating Ornithischiae (bird-hipped saurians), which included, for instance, the Triceratops and Stegosaurus species.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primal theropod.</seg>
		<seg id="20">It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.</seg>
		<seg id="21">On the skull of Tawa Hallae, for instance, the scientists found indications of air bags, as the descendants of the theropods, birds, have.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Tawa Hallae's bones of the spine were obviously also partly filled with air.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.</seg>
		<seg id="25">As the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, the joint ancestor of these two groups will probably have come up with this useful innovation.</seg>

		<seg id="0">At least three migration waves to North America</seg>
		<seg id="1">As the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the scientists come to the conclusion that the saurians appeared there first.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the planet, which still formed a single land mass as the super continent Pangaea.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This theory is backed up by the fact that the team found two more theropods which are not particularly closely related along with the remains of Tawa Hallae.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The three cannot possibly descend from a common ancestor. So they must have migrated there, is the scientists argument.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But there are of course contradictions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in what is today Poland, says the Bonn-based palaeontologist Martin Sander.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He believes that a distorted picture may emerge simply because a high number of primitive dinosaur fossils have survived over the years, while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents.</seg>
		<seg id="9">How dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sidearm of the reptile tree to become the ruling tetrapod vertebrate of the Mesozoic, is still anybody's guess.</seg>
		<seg id="10">During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs still shared their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles, for instance with the ancestors of today's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Towards the end of the Triassic period, the dinosaurs spread across the globe and developed many new species, while their relatives died out on the threshold from the Triassic to the Jurassic periods.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Success story did not last for ever</seg>
		<seg id="13">There are two theories to explain this switch, says Martin Sander.</seg>
		<seg id="14">There may have been a case of mass dying, which the dinosaurs randomly survived but not the other reptiles.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Or the dinosaurs were better adjusted, meaning that they were able to beat off the competition.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In any event, the success story did not last for ever.</seg>
		<seg id="17">150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals, which had also developed back in the Triassic period and since lived in the shadows to blossom: the mammals.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The impact and dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated.</seg>
		<seg id="2">For its supporters, the project deals no less than with the &quot;new heart of Europe&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Quite rightly so. S21 is far more than lowering a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Stuttgart 21 warn born out of the spirit of the 1980s.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Terminus stations with rails ending in the middle of towns were regarded as fossils of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology, which acted like brake blocks to contemporary rail traffic, as it used to take an awful lot of time to shift engines from back to front.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Pull in, stop briefly, pull out - that's the plan.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And therefore, terminus stations were supposed to disappear: as in Frankfurt and Munich.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And in Stuttgart: a non-terminus station, which is approximately half way along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the &quot;heart of Europe&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">S21 is actually being built now, although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the reality for years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Even very ambitious planners have recognised that it is virtually unpayable to lower the stations in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Terminus stations also no longer have pulling in and out problems since the development of push-pull trains with railway traction units and control cabs at either end.</seg>
		<seg id="12">And still: Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ulm is now being started.</seg>
		<seg id="13">State and municipal politicians have enforced it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">German Rail is participating, also because the risks of the Republic's biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpayer and not the state company.</seg>
		<seg id="15">As regards urban development, the development can be more or less justified.</seg>
		<seg id="16">An urban area is being created which, if the planners' computer-generated graphics are to be believed, will feature a lot of green.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For the rail traffic system, S21 is damaging.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The non-terminus railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transportation, which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth.</seg>
		<seg id="19">At the time, there was no competition from no-frills airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Contemporary traffic policy, however, should be prioritising the handling of freight transportation, as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lorry on the road.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But the line to be built is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes.</seg>
		<seg id="22">More seriously, S21 also affects many other rail projects.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A good six billion euros are to be buried in the Swabian land.</seg>
		<seg id="24">That is the official figure.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Experts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic.</seg>
		<seg id="26">One thing is for sure, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network over the next decade.</seg>
		<seg id="27">A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the transport ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="28">One of the most important ones is to expand the some 180 km of the line through the Rhine valley.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Work has been continuing on the line in slow motion since 1987.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is urgent to really put the foot down here.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But S21 will act as a brake block.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The Rhine valley line will become a bottleneck for international freight transportation: right in the heart of Europe.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the verdict of Hesse's Administrative Court (VGH) to ban night flights.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400+-page VGH verdict, said economics minister Dieter Posch (FDP).</seg>
		<seg id="3">The VGH in Kassel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to reorganise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to the verdict, the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as planned by the state government, is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdict.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.</seg>
		<seg id="7">SPD party leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel demanded the CDU and FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights, which they made before the election. Otherwise, this would have to be rated as the &quot;breaking of a promise&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is bloody difficult when you are allowed to keep one's word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan &quot;We keep our word&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Minister Posch rejected the accusation from Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by &quot;skewing justice and playing tricks&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">A detailed legal examination would take time.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of &quot;a brief first impression&quot;.</seg>

		<seg id="5">Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through convertible loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The rest of the amount was taken from its own kitty, which was well filled through the sale of business units.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A quick choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">It all happened a lot faster than expected.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster is able to present his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the appointment.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The favourite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF's main studio in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But ZDF did not confirm this - officially, not to anticipate the process.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, the plan not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this suggestion were also not successful with the board of directors, will also have played its part.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The result of the vote was not known when going to press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Two weeks ago Schächter had been unsuccessful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender by another five years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender's voting out was a severe blow to Schächter, albeit one to be expected.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Because the majority of the Union in the administrative board had signaled already weeks before the vote that they would not confirm Brender in office.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Roland Koch, the prime minister of Hesse, had organised the opposition to the editor-in-chief.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the argument that ZDF's news broadcasts had lost viewers under Brender, he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the exercising of political influence on the ZDF was castigated.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Most recently, 35 civil rights campaigners had even joined the debate and rated the actions of Koch to be in breach of the Constitution.</seg>
		<seg id="16">To no avail.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Personal details</seg>
		<seg id="18">Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He studied political and educational sciences and Romance studies.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He later worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the heute-journal.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Subsequent activities: From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor-in-chief; in 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the Morgenmagazin; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign affairs; then head of the ZDF head studio.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The Greens announced after the voting out of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin only on Wednesday, to press constitutional charges.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Koch's opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatine prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should amend the ZDF treaty to the extend that staff suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, Beck too ruled out any removal of party politicians from the boards of directors of the ZDF.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by harshly criticising the committee immediately after it voted out Brender.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Thanks to this proof of editorial independence, both Schächter without losing face and the board of directors were able to vote for his appointment as editor-in-chief, without being suspected of promoting a partisan to this post.</seg>
		<seg id="28">In party calculations, Frey is reckoned to be a left-leaning liberal anyway.</seg>
		<seg id="29">University courses to be cleared out</seg>
		<seg id="30">Partial success for students: After a year of educational strikes, the culture ministers of the states finally came around on Thursday: At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Principals Conference, both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for bachelor and masters courses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The students should, in the future, be in a position to master their studies.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In particular, they agreed to reduce the number of exams: Every module shall, as a rule, be completed with one single exam.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In addition, the students' workload shall be reviewed and &quot;a realistic and acceptable extent&quot; ensured.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Politicians and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of exams taken between the colleges inside and outside Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The states undertake to organise more flexibly joint structural requirements for bachelor and masters courses.</seg>
		<seg id="36">State regulations deviating from this, shall not be imposed.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Less exams</seg>
		<seg id="38">Since the start of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university principals have been referring to the dictum of better studiability.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The so-called accreditation council has decided to, in part, dramatically reduce the number of exams: &quot;Every module ends, as a rule, with an exam,&quot; states the 30-page paper, which is to newly govern the admission of courses in part.</seg>
		<seg id="41">With the &quot;clear reduction of the examination load&quot;, explains accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, &quot;an undesirable development is to be stopped, which had a grave impact on studiability&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="42">In addition, &quot;studiability&quot; is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the future.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Modules and contents &quot;shall be strictly reviewed&quot; as to whether &quot;unnecessary constrictions on the students in their choice of</seg>
		<seg id="44">events&quot; would be avoided.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The students are &quot;entitled to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses.</seg>
		<seg id="47">They need to be &quot;reaccredited&quot; every five years, which, however, means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany oversee this, which report to the Accreditation Council set up by the states.</seg>
		<seg id="49">The culture ministers had &quot;expressly&quot; urged the states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exams regime not too strict.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In some federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state ministries.</seg>
		<seg id="51">Rhineland-Palatine has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process;so far, it is the only state to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="52">With this money, the colleges are, in particular, to set up tutor programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exams and foreign offices.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The state and colleges plan to earmark 10 million euros for this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the Universities Act before parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="55">According to it, only one exam should be necessary to complete a course model.</seg>
		<seg id="56">The course design is to become more flexible, while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses.</seg>
		<seg id="57">By the end of the coming year, all courses of the state are to be examined for their studiability.</seg>
		<seg id="58">The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="59">On top of praise, there was also criticism for the decisions.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The federal board of the Young Socialist University Groups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place &quot;behind the closed doors&quot; of ministers and university principals.</seg>
		<seg id="61">After the educational strike, at the latest, students should now also &quot;have their say&quot; as those affected.</seg>
		<seg id="62">The future academics received support from the president of the Conference of University Principals (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: &quot;We need the experiences of the students,&quot; she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers, with whom the HRK was debating a joint reform paper.</seg>
		<seg id="63">The Education and Science Union (GEW) deemed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough: It is demanding a legal claim, which would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree admission on a further masters course.</seg>
		<seg id="64">On the other hand, the states must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor students there are sufficient places on master courses with best-possible studying conditions, says GEW executive board member Andreas Keller.</seg>
		<seg id="65">The states must employ significantly more lecturers.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The culture ministers did, however, not issue a statement regarding free admission to masters courses.</seg>

		<seg id="0">More than a footnote to Herta Müller</seg>
		<seg id="1">Going in and out of Germany is nice, virtually no checks...&quot; is the first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he describes in disturbing fragments a dissident's experience of arrival, who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Werner Söllner, born in Romania's Banat in 1951, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's publishing house, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Söllner has won several literature awards, in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Readings at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He caused a major extra-literary stir last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, debating &quot;German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securitate files&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Clearly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement, in which he admitted before Romano-German writer colleagues, i.e. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service, Securitate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Jointly with some of those present, Söllner 1989 had received the German language award in 1989.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The recruitment attempts started gradually, first in 1971.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I am, Söllner concluded, &quot;therefore someone, who did not put up enough resistance to the intimidation attempts of the Securitate.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Virtually at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and her unmatched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictatorships, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors with Romanian roots is being shocked by a case which reveals the dark spots and perfidy of a political system based on control and spying.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Werner Söllner is, inasmuch as can be said on the basis of the current knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a part, said after Söllner's confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He &quot;boxed him out&quot; in all points which were dangerous for him at the time, said Markel.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He has a moral need to make this statement.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Söllner's statement was in this form unexpected before this audience, although the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Germany was a cosy habitat for the Security spies, as Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Those affected, one can assume, will have guessed and in some cases even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sorin, Voicu and, of course, Walter.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Contrary to the now very secure process of viewing Stasi files in Germany, the approach to the legacy of Securitate control is still very diffuse.</seg>
		<seg id="19">A systematic clarification has been undermined and hindered in recent years.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A National Council to Process Securitate Files (SNSAS), which is comparable to the Birthler Authority, was only set up in 1999, but the release of the files has been very slow.</seg>
		<seg id="21">A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The fact that the influence of former Securitate members is still very big in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller by an interview, in which a former Securitate head from Timisoara spoke in derogatory terms of the prize winner.</seg>
		<seg id="23">They is psychotic, she was, after all, questioned more than once.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The infamy of power believed it could openly speak in the guise of freedom of speech.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The Söllner case does, as so often in connection with silent guilt, raise questions.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Why only now? Who fell victim? The level-headed reaction of the audience to Söllner's statement gives rise to the hope that a continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for information than finger-pointing and shame.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Regarding the genesis of Herta Müller's oeuvre, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, it is more than a footnote.</seg>

		<seg id="1">It seemed as if a well-dressed field sales representative was just coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports items manufacturer had handed out goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier got in a called out Mercedes C class at a quarter past midnight. ¨</seg>
		<seg id="2">The man with the striking bald head was still needing a chauffeur, as the town was still unknown to him.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all, no alcohol was involved and the 55-year-old was not drunk.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A nice evening, but tomorrow the work would continue.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Or only just get going.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In the words of the Swiss national, who had only just been employed three days before: &quot;We may have reached the last sixteen,&quot; i.e. in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, &quot;but we mustn't be blinded by the success: We are in for a brutal fight against relegation.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The &quot;far more important task&quot; is scheduled for Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Champions League performance will have to be repeated in the day-to-day job of the league.</seg>
		<seg id="9">And the again revealed weaknesses after the three quick goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) will have to be stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Draw</seg>
		<seg id="11">The last sixteen of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 + 23/24 February/second leg 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The joy over the excellent start of the Babbel successor therefore remained mute.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Not only with the apparent saviour, who had given the unsettled Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy in playing in a short period of time.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I addressed the players and told them that they must consider their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous,&quot; explained shrink Gross his so simple-sounding recipe for success, which no longer had any effect under therapist Babbel.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He set a certain magic alight, admitted Babbel fan Lehmann, &quot;When now impulses are given in football, things happen which are considered to be impossible&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And Sami Khedira, who became the man of the match thanks to his dynamic approach having been injured for weeks, tried to describe the &quot;phenomenon&quot; with the proverbial &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; and the work approach of the new boss: &quot;He is a man who takes drastic measures and demands discipline.</seg>
		<seg id="17">That is what we need in the current situation.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">Under Babel this was clearly lacking.</seg>
		<seg id="19">VfB Stuttgart is still not out of the woods, warns sports director Horst Heldt</seg>
		<seg id="20">But VfB Stuttgart needs, more than anything, consistency.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Like Gross, players and managers were eager not to overestimate the win over the depleted and hopelessly overburdened defence of the Romanian guests.</seg>
		<seg id="22">They had also won in Glasgow before the horribly awakening three days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4, warned Khedira.</seg>
		<seg id="23">And sports director Horst Heldt pointed out that one aim of the season had been achieved, but that the other one was still a long way off.</seg>
		<seg id="24">We are not out of the woods yet.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The fact that Heldt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40th birthday and even on the first home win for three months, had to do with the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was screened immediately before the match.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are decisions which other people take and not Jens, was Heldt's response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He had accused the directors of a lack of leadership, who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pubescent fans.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled, was also rated by Lehmann as a sign of a lack of authority and resentment.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Lehmann's statements were &quot;guided by pure egoism&quot;, replied Heldt and announced consequences for the keeper.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is unlikely they will become friends for life.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But, after all, they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of coaches, the strong performance, both in terms of play and spirit, would not have been possible.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Babel and seine assistants had &quot;a great share in the success&quot;, said Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Heated duel in Berne: Challenger Kevin Johnson kept provoking world champion Vitali Klitchko with words and gestures.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The verdict of the judges was unanimous.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hamburg - Vitali Klitchko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Saturday night in Berne the 38-year-old champion (the WBC association version,) beat the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).</seg>
		<seg id="6">For Klitchko this was his third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Before, the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Unfortunately, the knock-out, which everybody had expected, did not materialise.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Klitchko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice he had to give in due to injury.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Challenger Johnson saw his first defeat in 24 fights.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre tall Klitchko aimed to dictate the match predominantly with his left hitting hand.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But the eleven centimetres shorter Johnson, how had announced the end of the Klitchko era before the fight, kept evading the hits from the world champion, meaning that Klitchko was not able to apply a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Overall, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and simply tried to survive the rounds.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Although he provoked Klitchko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Nevertheless, he is only the second boxed since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 who fight the full twelve rounds against Klitchko.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The challenger had caused quite a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He insulted Klitchko as &quot;an ugly zombie&quot;, who &quot;cannot do anything at all&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="18">During weighing, the champion then allowed himself to be provoked to knock Johnson's sunglasses of his nose &quot;to be able to see into his eyes.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">Fourth victory after Klitchko's return</seg>
		<seg id="20">Klitchko came out on top in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="21">After a sabbatical nearly four years, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained &quot;his&quot; WBC belt, which he had been forced to hand over before without a fight.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This year he then beat in the defence of his title the Cuban Juan Carlos Gomez from and Chris Arreola from the US in September.</seg>
		<seg id="23">I only took one blow in this fight, and am physically in very good shape, Klitchko said after the quick return to the ring.</seg>
		<seg id="24">His dream, however, remains the unification of all important titles in his family.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.</seg>
		<seg id="26">But the WBA belt is worn by Britan David Haye after he dethroned the 2.13-metre tall Nikolay Valuev in November.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Haye had previously cancelled in the summer a fight planned to take place in September against Vitali Klitchko.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Apparently, his promotion company is now already planning a fight against Klitchko at London's Wembley stadium.</seg>

		<seg id="4">The minister apparently made &quot;knowingly false statements&quot; regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, said Green party head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme Tagesschau.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This is generally referred to as lying.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The order to kill was given in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That is the substance of the report, which NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.</seg>
		<seg id="8">On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers, but also to specifically kill two Taleban leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The US air strike ordered by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed of injured, according to the NATO inquiry report.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Greens, SPD and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellor's Office, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resolutely.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Chancellor's Office did not take any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Saturday, doubts over the presentation by the ministry of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert emerged.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to information available to SPIEGEL, the two provided Guttenberg with correct and complete information on the background of the tanker trailer attack.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Officially, it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister.</seg>
		<seg id="17">From the entourage of the top official, however, it was said that the defence ministry had even been directed to several reports, including a two-page documents of the commanding colonel Klein and a report from the military police.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the meantime, Wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He has not received a response, it is claimed.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament, which would be set up next Wednesday.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Dream worlds</seg>
		<seg id="1">Some see images and hear voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Not only in the mentally sick and during intoxication with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become blurred.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As long as this happens in sleep, things are fine.</seg>
		<seg id="4">When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender to the wildest imaginations and fantasies without restraint.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake, is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict, or strange at the very least.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But such images and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This is down to our imagination: The same neural processes which allow us to design houses, draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream, madness and reality become blurred.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Even if their triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detachment from reality conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Gravity no longer has any power over him</seg>
		<seg id="13">The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Aristotle understood hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, detected in 1861 a &quot;huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions&quot;, for Sigmund Freud dreams were even &quot;a psychosis, with all puzzles, delusions and misperceptions of such&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.</seg>
		<seg id="16">His body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats at the ceiling of the room.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He feels a kick.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Behind him are winged devilish figures with red, distorted faces, snarling.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against walls, he feels the pain all over his body.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Loud, evil voices emerge from the walls and radio.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He can no longer stand them, the voices that abuse and insult him.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, ties them to a knot and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He climbs on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He jumps.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The noose becomes loose.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Let that be a lesson to you, the voices scream in an eardrum-tearing choir, &quot;go to the clinic and get treated!&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has had six acute psychoses, the last one is two years back, the first nearly 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It was caused by LSD.</seg>
		<seg id="30">His diagnosis is a schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also a manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, the mania and schizophrenia.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.</seg>
		<seg id="32">In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation, he says.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The illusions are a brutal reality</seg>
		<seg id="34">About 1 per cent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, it is treated with a frequency only second to depression.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they reach an overexcited condition which can result in hallucinations, megalomania, paranoia or persecution mania.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command, comment or involve in dialogue.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Visual hallucinations are also not rare.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is flooded by impressions.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Like dreams, a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a flood of ideas and phantasies, which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred, says professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Schizophrenic patients are at the heart of the events, the meaning of everything is directed to him.</seg>
		<seg id="42">At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events can cannot affect them actively.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A reality comparison is often not available to them, the illusions are a brutal reality, waking up is not possible.</seg>
		<seg id="45">To experience a hallucination once in your life</seg>
		<seg id="46">Contrary to dreams, says Fuchs, &quot;the sensual and spatial structure of reality, as perceived during a psychosis, remains intact as a rule&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Precisely why our brain plays such tricks on us, is still puzzling to scientists.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Extraordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time, says Fuchs.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But not everybody will develop a psychosis.</seg>
		<seg id="51">There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Scientists assume that patients have minimal brain damage.</seg>
		<seg id="53">We think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy, for instance, explains Fuchs.</seg>
		<seg id="54">But it remains a mystery how disturbances to the neuronal system comes about which also do not become manifest for many years initially.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses, as they interfere with the transmitter system.</seg>
		<seg id="57">When our brain runs hot</seg>
		<seg id="58">The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Whether these illusions are perceived to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions; last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Hallucinations are a typical by-product of psychoses, but also of a remarkably large amount of other diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="62">These include, on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injuries.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Hallucinations, says Kasten, consist of memory fragments, which are often held back.</seg>
		<seg id="65">They occur when areas of the brain, where sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stimulation.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis.</seg>
		<seg id="67">But sensory deprivation, stress, lovesickness or other mental exceptional conditions too.</seg>
		<seg id="68">In more recent studies, up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.</seg>
		<seg id="69">In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Indeed, a perfectly normal girl.</seg>
		<seg id="71">It it were not for the images and voices.</seg>
		<seg id="72">During breaks, it can happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair approaches her.</seg>
		<seg id="73">When she answers him, her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy.</seg>
		<seg id="74">They think the girls is a nutty daydreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she knows that much.</seg>
		<seg id="75">She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her.</seg>
		<seg id="76">She can even feel his presence, at least for some moments.</seg>
		<seg id="77">A pleasant feeling it is, she likes the boy.</seg>
		<seg id="78">Am I mad? she sometimes asks.</seg>
		<seg id="79">But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.</seg>
		<seg id="80">At night the appearances are usually frightening</seg>
		<seg id="81">The illusions are often a strain.</seg>
		<seg id="82">When she is sitting in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new schoolmate, while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="83">At night the appearances are usually frightening.</seg>
		<seg id="84">When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes.</seg>
		<seg id="85">Let me be, she screams at the figures.</seg>
		<seg id="86">She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this, they would think she was mad.</seg>
		<seg id="87">Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old now.</seg>
		<seg id="88">She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boyfriend.</seg>
		<seg id="89">A year ago the hallucinations stopped.</seg>
		<seg id="90">Since she contacted psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows exactly that she is not mad.</seg>
		<seg id="91">Madness is also work of art born out of desperation</seg>
		<seg id="92">If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation, he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time, says Kasten.</seg>
		<seg id="93">I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment.</seg>
		<seg id="94">Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was small; she often played alone.</seg>
		<seg id="95">Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father.</seg>
		<seg id="96">As during visual and acoustic hallucinations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impressions and sounds, it is often difficult for patients like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. &quot;Every experience,&quot; says Kasten, &quot;takes place in the brain, reality is reproduced there.</seg>
		<seg id="97">Hallucinations are also images, which the brain creates, this is why they seem so real.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="98">Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination.</seg>
		<seg id="99">The hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psychosis.</seg>
		<seg id="100">Contrary to schizophrene patients, mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal.</seg>
		<seg id="101">Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.</seg>
		<seg id="102">Border between dream and hallucination</seg>
		<seg id="103">In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.</seg>
		<seg id="104">A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also brings positive aspects, creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation.</seg>
		<seg id="105">Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience, a particular form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams.</seg>
		<seg id="106">Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake.</seg>
		<seg id="107">The oneiroid condition occurs in trauma- or sickness-related extreme situations, for instance in polyradiculitis patients, who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness.</seg>
		<seg id="108">If a person is threatened by self- or world loss, for instance due to persistent, complete loss of mobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an own, imaginary world, which is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.</seg>
		<seg id="109">A kind of border between dream and hallucination</seg>
		<seg id="110">As the mastering of a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is not updated in the imagination.</seg>
		<seg id="111">An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation, which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emptiness of a loss of consciousness.</seg>
		<seg id="112">Everything is real, even later in the memory</seg>
		<seg id="113">The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole's attempt to safe itself.</seg>
		<seg id="114">He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit.</seg>
		<seg id="115">Claussen delves into a world of his creation, visits foreign places and times: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.</seg>
		<seg id="116">He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood.</seg>
		<seg id="117">He is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia.</seg>
		<seg id="118">He is fully taken up with the imaginary events; everything is real, even later in his memory.</seg>
		<seg id="119">These inner trips, Claussen believes, are fundamentally different from every dream.</seg>
		<seg id="120">Dream is a different condition, he describes his experience.</seg>
		<seg id="121">Contrary to that, the memories from mental trips are overtly clear to me even after years and in minute detail.</seg>
		<seg id="122">Even clearer and more intense that real events.</seg>
		<seg id="123">The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our day-to-day experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.</seg>
		<seg id="124">Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our images of the external reality are, even when awake.</seg>
		<seg id="125">Every change to the conscious, summarises psychologist Kasten, &quot;can result in a warping of what we call reality&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="126">An experience which can indeed be enriching.</seg>
		<seg id="127">The snow can come</seg>

		<seg id="2">Kallen, the new head of the publishing house, is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants his company to be taken over by his two children, he has told the SPIEGEL magazine.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The holding is to remain to 100% in the family.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees the long-term future of his company in his children's hands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are strongly intent on joining the company, the 69-year-old has told the SPIEGEL magazine.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The question whether they will be active in the company will only arise later.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Also the question whether they are able to do so.</seg>
		<seg id="9">One cannot put one's children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not capable of this.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That will kill the children, and the company with them.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On Thursday, Burda announced that he would be resigning from his post as chairman as of January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="12">52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.</seg>
		<seg id="13">He was initially responsible for technology.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Later, with the Treasury department, he assumed responsibility for the company assets, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's departure, also for direct marketing, foreign operations, print and finances.</seg>
		<seg id="15">For the first time, a person who is not a family member is thus at the helm of the publishing house.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Burda's children are 19 and 17; his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a couple of years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The appointment of Kallen is designed to &quot;bridge 10, 15 years&quot;, says Burda.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The holding is to remain to 100 per cent in family ownership, said Burda.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In light of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that family-owned companies are not safe from going under either: &quot;That always affected families who were infected with a capital addiction, who speculated wrongly and through they could advance to become a really big player.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That never was my strategy.</seg>
		<seg id="21">He never had &quot;dreams of world power&quot;, says Burda.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, catches a glimpse of 'a horizon of peace' for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he pointed out, is the principal export sector in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="2">In the Prime Minister's presentation of the Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures the government had launched throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector.</seg>
		<seg id="3">&quot;Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our major production plants,&quot; the Prime Minister explained.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Through this plan and the arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly competitive sector in Spain, we can have a horizon of peace for the future of this industry, which is our principal export sector,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In this regard, he recalled that theCompetitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan of the Automobile Industry (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The head of the Executive Branch explained that this investment was committed as much to the development of new models as it was to upgrading already existing products and processes.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support the demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and automotive brand.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to the Prime Minister, this plan has reduced emissions by 6% in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market and has brought about a &quot;sharp increase&quot; in enrollment, which rose by &quot;40 percent&quot; in November..</seg>
		<seg id="9">20,000 square meters of classic vehicles.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first year of the International Classic Car Showroom will be celebrated in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs of the motor world.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This initiative will take place from the 5th to the 7th of February, 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.</seg>
		<seg id="12">This is a 20,000 square meter exhibition area, and more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be there.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Not only will you find classic motorcycles and cars at ClassicAuto Madrid, there will also be all kinds of products related to the motor world.</seg>
		<seg id="14">So you will find the exhibitors at the pavilion displaying accessories, parts, components, textile accessories, complements, publications, miniatures, etc.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sportsmanship</seg>
		<seg id="1">Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not incompatible with the environment.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Therefore, Mazda3 has just added an engine stopping and starting system - dubbed as the i-Stop -, a mechanism which is, for the moment at least, only available with the 150-horse power 2.0 petrol engine.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for its overall high ratings.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The finishes, features, comfort, performance, mechanics, the i-Stop system…</seg>
		<seg id="5">All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Starting with the driver's seat, we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and support.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The feel of the steering wheel is also exquisite.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Moving on to thecombination of the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design with a great deal of buttons, knobs and striking red and blue colors.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.</seg>
		<seg id="10">So, we can say that the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of the German products, more specifically, the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Continuing with the interior, this Japanese compact is easily roomy enough for four adults to travel in great comfort.</seg>
		<seg id="12">All of this comes with a spacious trunk and standard dimensions.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The engine's automatic stopping and starting system, at least for now, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horse-power, manual, six-gear, petrol engine.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This engine is a real delight.What makes it outstanding are its subtlety, reduced noise levels, features and fuel consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="15">And even though the diesel versions of the Madzda3 will be in higher demand, those who don't do too much mileage a year should not dismiss this i-Stop petrol engine system, both for its elevated driving comfort and its fuel consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="16">As regards the level of the equipment, the version chosen for the test is called the Sportive, meaningit incorporates a high number of standard elements.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The standard equipment is excellent, especially the lane changing assistant (RVM) which eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the speed control, the interior photosensitive mirror, the large-screen onboard computer, the parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and lights sensor, Bluetooth and Bluetooth audio, and 17&quot; alloy wheels.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Additionally, with less equipment, this version comes with the Premium Pack, which, for 1,500 euros, also features: bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a BOSE sound system with CD changer, among other things.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Conclusion</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in its category.</seg>
		<seg id="21">It is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used, its performance, and the high standard of its equipment.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Additionally, those who do less yearly mileage can opt for this version of the i-Stop, associated only with the 150-horse-power 2.0 engine.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The only drawback of this model is its high price, which ranges from 21,770 euros for the Luxury pack to 23,270 euros for the Sportive version, tested here.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In exchange for the high price, the Mazda3 will offer a large daily dose of satisfaction.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The promise of FonPeek</seg>
		<seg id="1">Peek is extremely limited, a device that's only used for checking email, without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attachments or surfing the web.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Seeing it on the street is more difficult, to be honest, but the idea can be interesting, especially for children.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Unlike smartphones, the Peek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee, less than half, for example, of the iPhone's data plan.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Given its success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.</seg>
		<seg id="6">FonPeek, presented at the La Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It is just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but comes with a surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The monthly service price, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection)to check their mail.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The repeated twisting of the European Commission's arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had almost no noticeable effect.</seg>
		<seg id="13">There's a fear of using data outside one's home country, and rightly so.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For a gadget like the FonPeek (it no longer seems strange that it is called Fon since it lacks WiFi) to get this kind of fee, it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Kindle is another good example, including a book downloading feature and other internet queries.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No contracts, no bother.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It's a connected device and is paid for when it's purchased, not month by month.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a call option with life-time access, which the Peek already has in the U.S.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Not because I'm going to buy it.</seg>
		<seg id="20">I check my mail on my phone, thank you.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I hope so because I think it's an unfair model for the consumer.</seg>
		<seg id="22">It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Yellow is, without a doubt, the U.S. First Lady's favorite color.</seg>
		<seg id="2">She already attended Barak Obama's inauguration as U.S. president in a yellow dress and coat; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Michelle Obama wore a very similar dress on both occasions:apart from being a similar yellow-green color with bright highlights-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces, a dress, jacket and coat of the same material, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.</seg>
		<seg id="4">So much so that, at first glance, it seemed the first lady of the U.S. has been following the Princess of Asturias' lead and has opted to repeat her wardrobe.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But the material the two suits are made of make them very different.</seg>
		<seg id="6">If the inauguration was about thick lace, in Oslo it was patterned velvet.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The accessories have also varied: green medium-heeled shoes the other time, and now a similar design, but in gold.</seg>

		<seg id="0">75% of working mothers have had work problems during maternity.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This has been revealed by a study entitled 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to maternity.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The study notes that there are many differences in when couples start cohabiting, in the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Those that don't have an activity outside of the home, work part time, or don't have a stable job start living with their partner sooner, expect their first child, and have more children.</seg>
		<seg id="6">By contrast, women with a stable job, especially in the public sector, put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer offspring.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting to live together,a figure which increases to 4.1; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals, which has led them to postpone getting married and having children.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Additionally, the type of job held has a great influence over maternity, but less over the mating schedule,&quot; explains CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Level of education is another factor whichdifferentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child.</seg>
		<seg id="10">According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they get married and have their first child.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There was also a difference among women from the same generation.</seg>
		<seg id="12">For example, in a group of 35- to 49-year-olds, those who had elementary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time, on average, at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Their level of education provides yet another division among women.</seg>
		<seg id="14">While those who have an elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child,&quot; Delgado specifies.</seg>

		<seg id="9">In addition to being an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to be read and reread.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Here are some snippets.</seg>
		<seg id="11">On Albert Camus: &quot;In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn't a sea, rather a spiritual instinct, almost physical, the same one I felt without giving it a name: the pleasure against the ill-fated, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">On Samuel Beckett: &quot;Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">On Graham Greene: &quot;Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the road of perdition.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">On James Joyce: &quot;'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.This is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature which must be scaled by the north face, which the best mountain climbers hurl themselves off time and time again.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">On William Faulkner: &quot;He was a weird guy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county, and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;They were both dreams of grandeur.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: &quot;This writer took the deranged scream cried from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his eco, under his literary form, into the depths of the night of the 20th century, and made it a journey, hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">On Dorothy Parker: &quot;One day, she kneeled and prayed: ' Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman'.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="20">On Joseph Conrad: &quot;On his tomb were engraved these verses from Spencer: 'Sleep after toil,/port after stormy seas,/ease after war,/ death after life does greatly please.'&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">On Virginia Wolf: &quot;She also carried her depressions in her luggage.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The husband accepted it as normal when she told him that Edward VII spied on her from the azaleas and that the birds sang in Greek.</seg>
		<seg id="23">There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent came before her madness.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada when a group of kids between 15 and 18 years old passed alongside her and our dog, a mixed-breed, rescued from the pound and weighing no more than six kilos, and, without saying a word, kicked the dog twice, leaving the dog badly injured.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Our indignation knew no bounds because we don't see the fun in gratuitous aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was on a leash.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It must be added that it distressed the woman who was calmly taking a walk and who, when she reprimanded those individuals, came to fear for her safety, because a lunatic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an elderly person, and, certainly, to anyone weaker than himself.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The incident took place on aTuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet neighborhood.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The dog was crying all day.</seg>
		<seg id="6">By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station which we doubt means much, notto stir up trouble, just to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Michelin and Fesvial united on the use of helmets</seg>
		<seg id="1">The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, both organizations reported today.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing head injuries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety which &quot;goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day,&quot; and added that it also contributes towards this goal by means of other educational and informative measures.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be,' will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety &quot;is a constant concern&quot; for the company, as being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Sales of light commercial vehicles on the increase</seg>
		<seg id="7">Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% from 2008, and, more importantly, indicates the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers association(ANFAC) and the vendors association (GANVAM).</seg>
		<seg id="9">However, it's not time to start celebrating since the reference the comparison was made to -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The outcome is that, regardless of last month's upturn, the total number of registrations during those 11 months is 40% below last year's.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Since January, 95,853 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hotchpotch of light commercial vehicles were sold: derived vans, pick ups, vans, light vans and light-chassis trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At the same time, the storm clouds affecting demand have not completely cleared, so even though they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, almost all of which pay through external funding.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans, it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In light of this, unlike cars, the aid of the 2000Epurchase has done little.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Aside from individuals, provisions are made for the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of transactions has been insignificant.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Just yesterday, the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles, and also to commercial verhicles (trucks and buses), was brought to mind by GANVAM.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The sellers' association predicts that 2010 will be similar to the year coming to a close, which estimates a 19% drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4s).</seg>

		<seg id="1">Support systems to emergency brakes will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars, just as it happened with anti-lock breaks (ABS) and will happen with stability control (ESP)</seg>
		<seg id="2">In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian safety; however, how they work can also help prevent many rear-end collisions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">What the emergency brake assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects through the driver's pressure on the pedal.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But this doesn't always maintain that pressure through to the end.</seg>
		<seg id="6">According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer, Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before a collision and half of them didn't apply the full force.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Up to 1,100 accidents</seg>
		<seg id="8">The intervention of the aid, however, calls for the full braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this feature, 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The reduction will be even bigger -it estimates that one in four accidents injuring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to lightly applying the brakes.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal if it is necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If he does not react, and even though the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum force to the brakes to minimize damage.</seg>
