		<seg id="0">Schools urged to focus more on maths, spelling and grammar</seg>
		<seg id="1">English literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, Romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The exam will also feature &quot;unseen texts&quot; to encourage wider reading;</seg>
		<seg id="3">A combined English literature and language course will be scrapped.</seg>
		<seg id="4">From 2015, pupils will be required to take a standalone GCSE in language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Department for Education is due to release the new syllabuses in English and maths tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical overhaul.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It will make changes in other core subjects next year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In a separate move, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will unveil a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system and less coursework.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, said there was a &quot;widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting GCSEs would be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Studies show that English schools devote less time to maths - 116 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries.</seg>
		<seg id="10">By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and pupils do around 138 hours in Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="11">While there will be no formal requirement to devote more of the timetable to maths, Coalition sources said the extensive maths GCSE - combined with more weighting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The syllabus will place a greater focus on &quot;real world problems,&quot; including financial mathematics.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was condemned to two life sentences on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This was reported by broadcaster SABC.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The victim later died as a result of the serious injuries.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the start of the week.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The crime had caused nationwide horror.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial estate in Bredasdorp, near Capetown.</seg>
		<seg id="7">For 14 hours, doctors battled to save the life of the victim, ultimately in vain.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The sight of the young girl was so horrific that the carers and nursing staff required psychological support.</seg>
		<seg id="9">During the trial, Kana admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He also admitted to beating and raping her, however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The police had initially assumed that there were multiple attackers, however, they released two suspects from custody as the evidence against them was insufficient.</seg>
		<seg id="12">During the proceedings the public prosecution also emphasised that they were convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Rapes are almost part of everyday life in South Africa: There are around 64,000 reports of sexual assault every year.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is almost ten times as many as in Germany, although with a population of 82 million people, Germany has a much higher number of residents than South Africa (50 million).</seg>
		<seg id="15">Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual assault to be 10-25 times as high.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon, German time.</seg>

		<seg id="3">On the other eleven options markets, including two also operated by Nasdaq OMX, business continued as normal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The most recent incident is the latest in a series of both small and large breakdowns suffered by the stock exchange operator.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As recently as last Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In August of this year there were two breakdowns in a single week.</seg>
		<seg id="7">First of all, US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent large quantities of incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result, the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Two days later, half of all stock dealing in the USA came to a standstill for several hours, due to a computer failure in the Nasdaq exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Furthermore, last year the listing of Facebook on the stock exchange caused quite a furore.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Nasdaq systems could not cope with the flood of purchase and sales orders, the Exchange Supervisory Authority established at a later date, imposing a record penalty of 10 million dollars on the company.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Secret Service whistleblower, Edward Snowden is, in principle, willing to hold a discussion with the German authorities.</seg>
		<seg id="1">However, he first wishes for his situation to be clarified.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This was made clear by the former NSA employee, currently sought by the USA, in an open letter that Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele made public on Friday following a meeting with Snowden, and passed on to the Federal Government, the Federal Parliament and the Federal Public Prosecutor General.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The letter was purported to have been worded as follows:</seg>
		<seg id="4">To whom it may concern,</seg>
		<seg id="5">I have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I am Edward Joseph Snowden, formerly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the United States National Security Agency, and Defense Intelligence Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In the course of my service to these organizations, I believe I witnessed systemic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act.</seg>
		<seg id="8">As a result of reporting these concerns, I have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecution that forced me from my family and home.</seg>
		<seg id="9">I am currently living in exile under a grant of temporary asylum in the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.</seg>
		<seg id="10">I am heartened by the response to my act of political expression, in both the United States and beyond.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
		<seg id="12">These spying revelations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address formerly concealed abuses of the public trust.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mitigated.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defence.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However, speaking the truth is not a crime.</seg>
		<seg id="16">I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law.</seg>
		<seg id="18">I look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved, and thank you for your efforts in upholding the international laws that protect us all.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The two boys, aged 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">On Tuesday, armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old to death and threw the body into a well, reported the &quot;El País&quot; newspaper on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">They then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A five year-old half-sister of the younger offender, who they took with them, was to make a statement as an alibi, stating that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, when the girl described the progression of events to the police without mentioning an attack against herself, the two boys confessed to the pre-meditated murder of the 11-year-old.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The government in Jerusalem fails to confirm an attack on the Syrian airforce base</seg>
		<seg id="1">On Thursday, an American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, made a statement to American news broadcaster CNN, stating that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an airforce base in the Syrian town of Latakia the day before.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The target was &quot;missiles and related equipment&quot;, which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was fired upon during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were identified as the responsible party.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Israeli television broadcaster Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, in which Russian S-125 Newa-type defence missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads weighing up to 70 kilograms.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Unsure, the government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, press agency Reuters has also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not sure.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In any case, a spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said: &quot;We are not commenting on these reports&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, writing for daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, emphasised that the Syrian regime had already previously attempted, in some cases successfully, to deliver ground to air missiles to Hezbollah.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The Israeli government had previously repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a &quot;red line&quot;, which would result in a military response.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Trekking through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care</seg>
		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle is bringing free health care to rural villages in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">There aren't many doctors in the west African country; just one for every 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Cast your vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or any of the other top 10 Heroes, to be CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">That person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness, traveling to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He suffered only a broken arm at first, but an infection developed and spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; Georges Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, getting whatever treatment they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It's not easy,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">You can leave home at 5 a.m., running to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There are a lot of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some people can die because they are waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation hasn't changed much since Bwelle's father passed away in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.</seg>
		<seg id="20">For comparison's sake, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if they could see a physician, many Cameroonians couldn't afford it.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health-care spending is private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">And with poverty, they cannot enjoy their life.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon in Yaounde's Central Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="28">And he started a nonprofit, ASCOVIME, that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people jam into vans, tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Their luck doesn't always hold out.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they arrive, they receive a true heroes' welcome: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In these villages, free medical care is truly a cause for celebration, and Bwelle -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We are receiving 500 people in each trip,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They are coming from 60 kilometers around the village, and they're coming on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others might receive crutches, a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that's required for school but that many impoverished families simply can't afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evenings, the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse, town hall or home; after the procedure, patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With the group's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work into the early hours of Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They are beating drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year, and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that the free hernia surgery he'd received will allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;This will change my future with my family,&quot; the man said.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It's this second job, he said, that funds about 60% of his nonprofit; the rest is covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I'm not sure when he sleeps,&quot; said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Bwelle's group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle on his missions, it's a hands-on opportunity they'd never get at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,&quot; O'Malley said.</seg>
		<seg id="56">That's not something you'd ever get to do in America as a second-year medical student.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The student volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medical supplies.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But once they arrive in Yaounde, their board, transportation and instruction are covered by Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;He's a hero, without a doubt,&quot; O'Malley said.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the Cameroon people is everlasting.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Bwelle, the near-constant workload isn't a hardship.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when I am doing this work,&quot; Bwelle said.</seg>
		<seg id="64">And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I am doing.</seg>
		<seg id="66">To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Check out the ASCOVIME website and see how to help.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February</seg>
		<seg id="1">Pope Francis will create new cardinals of the Catholic Church for his first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church below the pope, and they're the ones who elect popes, so Francis will be appointing his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.</seg>
		<seg id="3">There are now 201 cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, once a cardinal reaches 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a pope -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting of all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, known as a consistory.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convoke February's consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to have dropped.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He said usually a pope would name as many cardinals as was needed to raise the number of cardinal electors back to 120 and as many cardinals aged over 80 as he wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Next year's consistory would be significant because it would be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At the moment there is a sort of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have a tiny number of cardinals.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking into ways to reform the church.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In the past the Pope decided everything on his own.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But we've not been in that situation before -- it's all completely new.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Valero said popes typically elevated bishops from large places to the position of cardinal but that Francis was &quot;full of surprises -- so we don't know who he'll name.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?</seg>
		<seg id="1">Business for Britain launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and define what the UK's wealth and job creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders asking them for their thoughts on Britain, business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">YouGov polled over 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of Britain's business sizes, sectors and regions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The conclusions of the poll will come as a surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want to see the Government prioritise new trading links with the likes of China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's arcane institutions.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There was general discontent with the Single Market, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European of companies, agreed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Finally, and most tellingly of all, our poll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see Britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU that is based on trade, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This finding, which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a &quot;meaningful change&quot; that brings powers back to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for Britain sees a 16 per cent swing towards voting to stay in the EU in a referendum.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this poll shows that British business backs his plan for renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that business expects that renegotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="14">A better deal for British business is possible, and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our poll show, for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels&quot; regulatory approach.</seg>

		<seg id="3">&quot;What's innovative about it is that the six-month courses end with diplomas,&quot; said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="4">There are many benefits: The participants will not be unemployed, the companies receive trained skilled workers, which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants, and the agency will not have to fund unemployment.</seg>

		<seg id="1">General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to repair a problem with the manual reclining seatback, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On some of the trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the reclining mechanism.</seg>
		<seg id="3">As a result, the seatbacks fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head restraints.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect occupants, increasing the risk of injury,&quot; according to the notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.</seg>
		<seg id="6">GM's truck roll-out began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the No. 1 U.S. automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.</seg>
		<seg id="7">GM told truck owners about the defect in the first half of October.</seg>
		<seg id="8">NHTSA could not review the owner notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which tempered auto sales growth in October.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up about 20 percent during the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">GM shares were up 1.4 percent at $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.</seg>

		<seg id="1">When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg devised a plan.</seg>
		<seg id="2">He buried the deceased in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to police investigations, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allowance.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He first covered up the death of the 89-year-old and then pocketed the money for more than a year and a half.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The 67-year-old must now face charges of fraud, said a spokesperson on Friday.</seg>
		<seg id="6">According to the statement, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The man was already under suspicion back in May: At that time the fact that medications for his care-reliant mother were no longer required drew suspicion.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The pensioner told investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The officials found this strange and so continued to investigate.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had cared for her in her final days.</seg>

		<seg id="2">On Saturday 7 September, the Highland Games will start at 1:30 p.m.</seg>
		<seg id="3">While they are of course a Scottish tradition, they have been given a touch of Swabian colour at the Kaltenhof event grounds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Teams and individual competitors will be pitted against one another in the disciplines of tossing the caber, horseshoe tossing and bucket carrying.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The caber is four and a half metres long and weighs 25 to 30 kilometres.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;It isn't about the distance,&quot; explains organiser Peter Saile.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The log must be thrown vertically, somersault once and then finish lying straight.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This scores maximum points.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In tossing the horseshoe, it all comes down to accuracy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Horseshoes are thrown onto a peg from a distance of eight metres.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Participants must then prove their skill and strength by carrying a bucket of water 50 metres.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Time is recorded and water quantity measured in a vat at the end.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;It is a frightening place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?&quot; the paper said, challenging the bill as unconstitutional.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;This law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, managing director for Capital Group - home to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it's an extension of the government,&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;I hope the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot;a stranglehold over the media,&quot; while The Standard said democracy and free speech in Kenya had been &quot;dealt a major blow&quot; and lambasted the bill as &quot;draconian.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">The passing of the bill comes amid a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the September's attack by Islamist gunmen on the Westgate shopping mall.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Kenya media drew the ire of authorities by broadcasting security camera footage of troops who were dispatched to the scene of the attack purportedly robbing the upmarket mall.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media executive for questioning, although the summons was retracted following a media outcry.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Under the new bill, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot;de-listed,&quot; or barred from receiving official press accreditation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The tribunal also has the power to seize the property of an offender if a fine is not paid.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine is enough to cripple most FM stations.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">It also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as Kenya's &quot;lively blogosphere.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">By silencing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they like with impunity.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering,&quot; he wrote.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In May they voted to overturn cuts ordered by the national salaries commission and reinstate their hefty salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free - ranked among the highest in the world.</seg>

		<seg id="0">2014 is to be a year of celebration in Geisingen</seg>
		<seg id="1">The anniversary celebrations in the town of Geisingen, to mark the 1,250th</seg>
		<seg id="2">anniversary of the first documented mention of the town, are drawing closer.</seg>
		<seg id="3">When the year comes to an end in just eight weeks, the anniversary year will be upon us.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first documented together in the year 794.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A deed was drafted in Kirchen, in which both towns are mentioned.</seg>
		<seg id="6">On 15 March, the anniversary year will be officially launched, and because Geisingen currently has no suitable venues, this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first documented 1,250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As part of the anniversary celebrations, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate the 1,250th anniversary with a celebratory weekend from 18 to 20</seg>
		<seg id="9">July.</seg>
		<seg id="10">On the Friday there will be a ceremony, and on the Saturday and Sunday a party will be held at the Kirchtalhalle.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The Kirchen-Hausen Kirchenfest festival will also be held on this celebratory weekend.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Town Musical Director, Rudolf Barth, has composed a commissioned piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.</seg>
		<seg id="13">On 21 June, in conjunction with the Schwarzwaldverein [Black Forest Association] Mid-Summer Festival, on 12 July in the Arena, accompanied by fireworks, and on 13 December as the first concert put on by the Stadtmusik (Town Musical Society) in the new Festival Hall.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This venue will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, with the official date set for the last weekend in September, on 27 and 28 September.</seg>
		<seg id="15">On the occasion of the Geisingen town anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;However, it will not merely be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but rather a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which now consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,&quot; said Mayor Walter Hengstler.</seg>
		<seg id="17">And the Geisingen of today is also celebrating a birthday in 2014, as it was in 1974 that the incorporations to form the current region were completed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The new chronicle is to be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival Hall in Geisingen.</seg>
		<seg id="19">However, 2014 is also a year of many anniversaries in other respects.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The Narrenzunft Strohglonki (Strohglonki Fool's Guild celebration) begins on 8 February with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary/ The Harmonie Gutmadingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 March will hold a celebratory banquet and then from 1 to 4 May will be celebrating the Bezirksfest [District Music Festival].</seg>
		<seg id="21">The Leipferdingen Nursing Home will turn 40 years old, the Geisingen School has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebrating this on 10 May, and the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebrating this as part of the Brunnenfest [Fountain Festival] from 4 to 7 July.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The town of Geisingen was first officially documented in the year 764, in a deed of donation, which is now in the possession of the St. Gallen Monastery.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The deed was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which at the time was the location of the courthouse.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Both communities are thus mentioned in the same deed.</seg>
		<seg id="25">One reason for choosing 2014 to celebrate the 1,250-year anniversary in this way, is that it also coincides with the 40th anniversary of the Community Reform (Gemeindereform).</seg>

		<seg id="1">In a major victory for the Obama administration, the US Supreme Court today ruled Barack Obama's signature health care law is constitutional.</seg>
		<seg id="2">By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the taxing power of the government.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the court while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy dissented.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page law, and further held that the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or else lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The law was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels manage to reach</seg>
		<seg id="2">It was with this piece of Bedouin wisdom that the first ever chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination behind the &quot;Helping Hands&quot; society.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Saturday evening saw the celebration of the tenth birthday of the organisation, which can already look back on impressive results.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Founding Chairman Henne reported in depth on the work of the organisation.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In 2004, he visited the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in Mauritania for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As a result, an important collaboration was developed and the gynaecologist, Hanne, has performed countless operations on several journeys to the location.</seg>
		<seg id="7">During the speech, images from the trips were shown on a large screen, in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The organisation's desert vehicle was also shown.</seg>
		<seg id="9">It is a former federal border protection vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Rainer Prewo, the former Lord Mayor of Nagold, made the suggestion of equipping this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to Henne, he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn built the hospital station in Socogim, a poor district on the edge of the Capital, in the record time of less than one week - free of charge.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Henne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nouakchott</seg>
		<seg id="13">This is particularly interesting at a time when Nagold is set to do away with its maternity clinic.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You learn a great deal working as a doctor in Africa, said Henne, for example that you should slow down to avoid burn-out.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Due to the political unrest in the country, it has not been possible to make as many journeys as planned, but for this reason, many local doctors have come to Germany, to sit in on lectures on a variety of topics.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, for example in March of this year when medical devices, medicines, bandaging material, hospital beds and spectacles were sent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour, telling of Mercedes vehicles in Mauritania converted into mobile goat stalls and sharing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the organisation on their trips to Mauritania.</seg>
		<seg id="18">He identified his personal motivation as being his work in the area of auditing as a young member of parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="19">When it became clear to him how much money is wasted, he decided to help the Africans with controlling of their budget by the people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Fuchtel also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kindness.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The fact that Africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Africa is not at all that far from Gran Canaria.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, serving as the foremost boundary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and Kirchstrasse, will once again feature on the renovation cost plan for the town of Bräunlingen.</seg>
		<seg id="1">In the days before the Kilbig Autumn Folk Festival, when the first renovation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard, a small corner wall with balustrades was installed to stabilise and relieve the static load on the old natural stone wall, which is more than one hundred years old.</seg>
		<seg id="2">According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlingen Municipal Planning and Building Control Authority, the ongoing procedure plans to involve the Regional Memorial Authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renovation concept for the old wall.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A cost calculation is to be performed by a team of professionals, which will then be submitted to the Town Council, which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A decision is expected to be made in the coming year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Following the renovation, plastering and planting of trees in the old internal school yard, within the two wings of the 1912 school, as a subsequent measure the boundary wall, which is in need of refurbishment, must be renovated from the ground up within the foreseeable future.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The historic, one hundred-year-old boundary wall between the old school-yard and Kirchstrasse is in need of renovation, primarily as a result of water and frost damage, on account of the lack of drainage, and is leaning forwards.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Deep cracks in a number of individual stones testify to the weather damage, however, at present the wall is not in danger of collapse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pupils, and this is the purpose of the current fortification work.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The school yard renovation was originally planned back in 2008/2009, however, high unplanned expenses meant that the work had to be pushed back.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Regional Memorial Authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming.</seg>
		<seg id="11">If this authority were to impose requirements, then the town of Bräunlingen would hope to receive subsidies from the monument preservationists.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The pupils of the Bräunlingen Primary School, who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building, with a new hall, will soon be able to use the old school yard as well.</seg>

		<seg id="2">Two sets of lights so close to one another: intentional or just a silly error?</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Gutacht's Mayor gave a clear answer to this question.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;At the time, the Town Hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route,&quot; explained Eckert yesterday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Kluser lights protect cyclists, as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of Bergle.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The system, which officially became operational yesterday, is of importance to the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junction.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We have the museum, two churches, the spa gardens, the bus stop, a doctor's practice and a bank, not to mention the traffic from the 'Grub' residential area.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;At times of high road and pedestrian traffic, an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety,&quot; said Eckert.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This was also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles travel through the town of Gutach on the B33 on a daily basis, of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent,&quot; emphasised Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary: &quot;Here safety comes first, it's that simple,&quot; said Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A total of four road safety inspections were carried out and a roundabout was also considered, however, this idea was rejected on account of the narrowness of the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstrasse junctions.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to Arnold, every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts: &quot;Using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree trunks, we also tested whether such vehicles could access the B 33 from the Sulzbachweg without knocking over the traffic light posts&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The traffic light system itself, which cost around EUR 15,000, is the &quot;most modern system that is currently available on the market,&quot; explained Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The system is fitted with coloured LEDs, which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights, even when the sun is low in the sky.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And they are also energy-efficient: The older light systems consume around 100 Watts, with the new ones consuming just eight.</seg>
		<seg id="17">There are three sets of lights per direction of travel.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Arnold explained the technology used by the new system: It is fitted with two radar sensors.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If the pedestrian presses the button at the traffic lights, the top radar sensor checks the traffic status.</seg>
		<seg id="20">If the street is clear, the pedestrian obtains a green light immediately, if not, there is a delay of around 15 seconds.</seg>
		<seg id="21">An additional radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;If a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street, the green phase is extended, thus ensuring that everyone gets safely across the street,&quot; explained Arnold.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Of course, drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Yesterday this was not the case: The light had barely turned green for pedestrians when a luxury vehicle sped through on a red light.</seg>

		<seg id="7">Anja Schlichter managed the tournament</seg>
		<seg id="8">The organisation of the tournament was placed in the trusty hands of Anja Schlichter, who was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After the first three matches and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament moved into the crucial phase.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The favourites, Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, were tied with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams from the SG Rohrweiler), meaning that the last two games had to produce a victor.</seg>
		<seg id="11">At the awards ceremony, Carmen Müller finally had the pleasure of presenting the Challenge Cup to Andre Maier and Matthias Bronner, who had shown the greatest staying power on the final leg.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Second place was taken by the Michael Klippel / Sadmin Osmicic partnership.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.</seg>
		<seg id="2">US authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The tunnel, which zigzags the length of nearly six football pitches, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The area is filled with nondescript warehouses, making it easier to conceal trucks being loaded with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tunnel was shut down before any drugs made it through undetected, authorities said.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Authorities seized eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel's discovery, according to court records.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They face prison sentences between 10 years and life imprisonment if convicted.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, which presents drug cartels with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A &quot;genuineness&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it contemplates expanding a crackdown.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The test, if adopted, would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="3">A government discussion paper was released today as former Labor MP Maxine McKew slammed the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Loud declarations about 'foreigners getting to the back of the queue' and 'Aussie jobs first' are a very unpleasant throwback to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Historically, that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of that historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka where he is meeting officials about people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remainder under consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If the &quot;genuineness&quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrutinised about &quot;whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relation or personal associate of an owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at Christmas Island this week.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The man's distraught nine-year-old son travelled to Australia with him and has been comforted since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the vessel.</seg>

		<seg id="3">With three gigantic mirrors, each 45 metres tall, a centuries-old dream came true on Wednesday.</seg>

		<seg id="3">During the morning, the Migration and Integration working group also sought to continue its discussions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nationality, in which regard both sides have opposing ideas.</seg>

		<seg id="6">Regarding the subject of traffic, which was not on the agenda for this Friday, the SPD substantiated its opposition to a car toll charge promoted by the CSU.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A toll road sticker would amount to a &quot;flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counterproductive,&quot; explained the SPD negotiator for issues relating to traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There would be a threat of diverted traffic on country roads, which are already accident hotspots.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Rhenus Midgard has also invested highly in land</seg>
		<seg id="2">They stockpile the coal that arrives on ships.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At the same time, the company also has other irons in the fire at the location.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Besides coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also active in the field of wind park logistics, among other ventures.</seg>

		<seg id="7">With each movement of the handling machines, a shrill warning noise rings out over the site.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;The signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescribed,&quot; said Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Unfortunately, in the event of unfavourable wind, they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The 40-year-old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in a position to make the warning signals quieter by means of the implementation of technical measures.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Halloween 2013: By the Numbers</seg>
		<seg id="1">When I was little, Halloween was magical.</seg>
		<seg id="2">My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress-up for the neighborhood.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Nowadays, I've become more of a scrooge.</seg>
		<seg id="4">I haven't signed up for the past two years to give out candy in my apartment and probably won't this year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">But stats show that I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.</seg>
		<seg id="7">One thing I do look forward to every Halloween are the trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Costumes are expected to account for $1.2 billion dollars out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Women don't have to be sexy professionals anymore; they can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for men, I expect we will be seeing a lot of zombies, thanks to The Walking Dead and I'll bet the Daft Punk space men will make it into our Instagram feeds this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the highest searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I guess there's nothing wrong with going traditional.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We dressed our dogs up last year and to my amazement we were not alone.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.</seg>
		<seg id="16">That's a lot of ironic hotdog dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="17">When it comes to candy, we don't screw around.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.</seg>
		<seg id="19">That's around 600 million pounds worth of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.</seg>
		<seg id="20">That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters set to take over our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In fact, we will buy and, who are we kidding, consume 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The one thing we don't want to consume, candy corn; and yet nearly 35 million pounds of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.</seg>
		<seg id="23">That's about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It's a mystery I have yet to solve.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing is more quintessentially Halloween than haunted houses.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They have the best names, like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which, by the way is in an actual prison), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">In fact, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States generating about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes those awesome photos of you mid-peeing your pants that your friend puts on Facebook and you can't take down and then that guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot;nice face.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">Finally, let's talk pumpkins.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Charlie Brown introduced us to The Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Lucky for us, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin trend&quot; started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these gourds not sitting in them.</seg>
		<seg id="31">This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The jack-o-lantern slowly withering on your front porch probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.</seg>
		<seg id="33">If you're looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032 pound pumpkin.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The District Court of Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, issuing threats and grievous bodily harm.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The former German soldier who, following two tours in Afghanistan, had worked as a doorman, made a confession within the context of a plea-bargaining procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to the confession, on five occasions he got to know women via Internet or telephone contacts, who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He broke any resistance by means of violence and the issuing of threats.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He kept the income from women, some of whom worked for him for years.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He prevented the women from making contact with the outside world by confiscating their mobile phones and SIM cards.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Together with an accomplice, who procured the women, he brought them to various brothels in the south-west.</seg>
		<seg id="8">There he had them monitored to some extent, in order to control their income.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Appearing before the court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues serving alongside him in Afghanistan had lost their lives in an explosion.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Once a psychiatric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psychiatric condition, and thus on his limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a full confession.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The court did not have to question any more of the female victims.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As an official from the Criminal Investigation Department reported, following the first conviction achieved using telephone surveillance measures, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The intercepted conversations were characterised by a high level of aggression.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In subsequent hearings, the victims confirmed their ordeal.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A further witness, whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bruises all over her body, is yet to make a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This is a case of a &quot;completely broken personality&quot;, that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Former NSW minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing maritime leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its inquiry into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to have leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without going to tender after their expiration in August 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It's now investigating allegations Mr Tripodi knew of Mr Obeid's secret interest in the properties, after evidence given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="5">During years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pushing for the leases to go to public tender.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The lessees were against this and also wanted longer terms.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In 2009 leases for the Circular Quay enterprises, which earned the Obeids about $2.5 million annually, were renewed without going to public tender.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Mr Tripodi, who was ports minister from February 2006 until November 2009, was initially in favour of public tenders.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But he denied the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged was urging a shift in government lease policy.</seg>
		<seg id="10">A phone transcript tabled in ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior bureaucrat who had come into the ports ministry after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy,&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On a mild day in late August a German police helicopter buzzed low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="2">On the instruction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the rooftop of the US outpost, which is located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">German media say the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and the action prompted an exchange between the US and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="4">James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">But ever since Edward Snowden, the contractor turned whistleblower, began releasing his treasure trove of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data held by US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have ratcheted corporate paranoia about state surveillance to new highs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The final straw came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for about a decade.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If Europe's most powerful person can be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.</seg>

		<seg id="12">German companies believe the US now poses almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by EY, the consultancy.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In all the documentation leaked by Mr Snowden, there has, however, been no evidence to date that the US has passed on foreign companies' trade secrets to its own companies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Business leaders are sceptical about this.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Someone in the German parliament says we should build a German Google.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I can only shut my eyes and slowly open them again...</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;That's not the way,&quot; Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP, says.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then one shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal, to cars and farmers.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Everything but the IT industry.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Still, the reach and technical sophistication of US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have come as a shock to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by China.</seg>
		<seg id="23">A big shift is occurring in cloud computing where European executives have become more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 per cent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining programme.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Jim Snabe, co-chief executive at SAP, says: &quot;We see a new question from customers that didn't come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="26">Many German executives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and these data must therefore be guarded at all costs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">That economic spying takes place is not a surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It has always taken place.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;This has been a topic for many years and hasn't fundamentally changed through the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical maker BASF.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level as we spy on them too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Corporate leaders are not generally keen to boast about the countermeasures they have taken, in case this hands an advantage to an attacker.</seg>
		<seg id="32">For large companies, the message has long since been drummed home that picking up a free USB stick at a trade fair, or leaving a laptop unguarded in a hotel room are unwise, to say the least.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Ulrich Hackenberg, board member at carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Germany's BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The prepaid mobiles are then thrown away afterwards.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular niche.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;Small and medium sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secrets effectively against unauthorised access,&quot; the BfV warns in a report.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The US warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The US National Intelligence Estimate in February named France alongside Russia and Israel in a second tier of offenders who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.</seg>
		<seg id="41">A board member at a German blue-chip company concurred that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="42">Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: &quot;The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they co-operate in the antiterrorist fight, spy on their allies.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">As crowds of horse-showing experts gathered in Cardiff to battle it out for Horse of the Year, they knew the competition would be tough.</seg>
		<seg id="1">But nobody was quite ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps, the toddler and his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through the three rounds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult opponents trailing behind.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The inseparable pair - who are the same height - were commended for appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest run by Sunnybank Equestrian Centre, in Rudry near Cardiff.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Taking to the stage against men and women in smart bowler hats, he tipped his flat cap at a jaunty angle and paraded two-year-old Toffee around the ring.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Fenton was lauded by judges for natural handling skills well beyond his years.</seg>
		<seg id="6">And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Fenton was given Toffee as a third birthday present last March and has practised with the Shetland pony every day since.</seg>
		<seg id="8">His mother Donna, 30, said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee are a great double act.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">They were up against all comers but the two of them walked off with the gold cup and rosette.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all ecstatic when he won.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Complete strangers in the arena all thought he was so phenomenal they wanted photos taken with him.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The youngster, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mrs Howells said: &quot;The whole place was electric and everybody was cheering and clapping.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">He was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a marvellous job.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Fenton is animal mad - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens which he looks after.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The way he has started he'll be at the Horse of the Year show before long - and I'm sure he'll do well.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A spokesman for the annual horse show said: &quot;Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">They are a great team together.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The judges marked Fenton and Toffee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They look for good teamwork between the pony and the handler - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.</seg>
		<seg id="21">I'm sure Fenton was helped by his cute clothes, he really looked the part.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Maintenance day at the small 'Engländerhütte'</seg>
		<seg id="1">For what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte (Englishman's Cottage) in Ibach</seg>
		<seg id="2">Following suggestions from the population, the of the valley in the area of the cottage was to be cleared, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to Kaiser, many hikers refer to this area as the showpiece of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature,</seg>
		<seg id="5">He is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself.</seg>
		<seg id="6">At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council, following the greeting by Regional Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken on the role of patron and wished the campaign every success.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to Tribukait, the tourist objective of the vision coincided with the goal of preserving the now extremely overgrown old Allmend grazing pasture, with its specific protected habitats, through its opening and connection to the still existing grazing land.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Certain species, such as rare butterflies or grasshoppers, cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas.</seg>
		<seg id="10">They require these clear pathways in order to preserve their species.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Tribukait said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned biosphere area.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The current measures do not integrate seamlessly into these plans.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A biosphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status, and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the Life Project and the previous care days.</seg>
		<seg id="14">After the various statements, forest ranger Christoph Wehle and Life Project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The larger trees had been cut down in advance, although forest tractors were on-call if required.</seg>
		<seg id="16">One group of helpers were to take care of the clearance of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The objective was to create a clear view at the viewpoint.</seg>

		<seg id="3">For the training exercise, department commander, Hans Kammerer, chose the Feder premises on Burgberger Strasse.</seg>

		<seg id="7">After a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The second person had to be carried.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow stairwell.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The building, a workshop with integrated stabling for two horses, was not easy to secure.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There were large quantities of wood and bales of straw stored inside.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In addition to this, there were also electrical machines for wood processing.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The first attempt to extinguish the fire was made using the tank on the fire engine.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Another line was taken from the surface hydrant around 100 metres away.</seg>

		<seg id="0">$325m rescue package for Tassie health</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Federal Government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the State Government can't waste the funds.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state's aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The funding, over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The Government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state,&quot; Ms Plibersek said today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The $325 million package includes a $31 million elective surgery blitz.</seg>
		<seg id="6">An additional 2600 operations including orthopedic and cataract surgery will help clear a backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There's also money for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, medical specialist training, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;These investments respond to the ideas that front-line clinicians have told me will be the best ways to tend to Tasmania's health system,&quot; Ms Plibersek said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The minister insisted the Tasmanian Government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds.</seg>
		<seg id="11">A three-person commission will be set up to ensure the state is delivering services as effectively and efficiently as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Wilkie today said the $325 million would count for little &quot;unless it's followed by genuine reform to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable footing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">He nevertheless praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;I'm hopeful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state's public health system off the critical list,&quot; Mr Wilkie said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to the State Government these additional elective procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But federal Opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a &quot;band-aid solution.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;The reason we are here is that the Labor State Government ripped $430 million out of its health system,&quot; he told ABC TV.</seg>
		<seg id="18">You can't have a state government ripping out almost half-a-billion dollars and the Commonwealth put in $300 million and pretend it's a good news day.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Mr Dutton called on Ms Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The theme of the day in the parish hall was &quot;Sayings from the Bible&quot; and &quot;Expressions from the Middle Ages&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Zita Köhler, the Chairperson of the Parish Council, agreed to give a talk on Biblical proverbs after breakfast.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Proverbs contain pearls of wisdom, commandments or warnings,&quot; she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="5">She compared several German sayings with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.</seg>
		<seg id="6">She referred to sayings such as: &quot;Holzauge sei wachsam&quot; (keep your eyes peeled), &quot;wie Schuppen von den Augen fallen&quot; (like scales falling from one's eyes), &quot;ein Auge auf jemand werfen&quot; (to cast an eye on someone), &quot;den Seinen gibt's der Herr im Schlaf&quot; (good things come to some when they sleep) and &quot;seine Hände in Unschuld waschen&quot; (to wash one's hands of something).</seg>
		<seg id="7">On several occasions, the speaker asked those listening to guess what proverb they were based on.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Expressions from the Middle Ages were addressed by Parish Councillor Christel Dehner: &quot;Aller guten Dinge sind drei&quot; (All good things come in threes), &quot;blau machen&quot; (to skip school/work), &quot;etwas verhauen&quot; (to wallop something).</seg>

		<seg id="0">You could call him the Dostoevsky of the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Philip K. Dick was a God seeker, a metaphysician, and to a certain extent his novels and stories also feature recurring themes.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The external likeness is astounding: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.</seg>
		<seg id="3">And so, as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky - with his massive oeuvre - is considered the revealer and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is considered an American prophet, who is certainly highly esteemed within his own native country.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Some titles have been released by the Heyne Verlag publishing house,the 'Haffman's cassette' featuring 118 stories was distributed by Zweitaudenseins.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dick illustrates America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, a fixation on security and the belief of having been chosen.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Dick had 'God experiences', and his later books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Perhaps he was crazy, or perhaps drugs had affected his brain.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He realised, early on, that computers are divinities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He wrote a 'Theology of the Computer' and questioned what separates humans from the machine, the creator from the creation.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That is the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; problem.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Killing.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A master of science fiction.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A fantastic writer.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His stories have inspired film producers such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The latter story is now particularly significant.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;Minority Report&quot; originates from the year 1956, and exudes the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here the principle of the &quot;Pre-Crime&quot; is developed, i.e. something that is now more or less official doctrine within the White House.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In Dick's world, which is alarmingly similar to our own, mutants look into the future - and the police have access to this insight.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;We arrest individuals who've broken no law,&quot; says the government official.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;We get to them first, before they can commit an act of violence&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And: &quot;In our society we have no major crimes, but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals&quot;. They read time streams.</seg>
		<seg id="22">They assume that bad things are going to happen and prevent the criminal thought turning into action.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Dick's tale acts as a blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the phone tapping madness of the NSA.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Anticipation of attack: This is also how Obama's drone philosophy and practices work.</seg>
		<seg id="25">However, Dick's story is not yet finished.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The Police Chief argues that there is no more division of power, the military controls daily life - and what is left of the State.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Then the watcher is himself being watched and is convicted of a future crime.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The system slips up.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It is perfect, but it lies.</seg>
		<seg id="30">It devises its own conditions.</seg>
		<seg id="31">It not only accepts errors and victims, but builds itself on them.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The system creates the threat that it is fighting against.</seg>
		<seg id="33">To read Philip K. Dick means to get closer to the truth, time and time again.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program and removed the judge from the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The judge had ruled in August the city violated the Constitution in the way it carried out its program of stopping and questioning people.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed her findings and her remedial orders, including a decision to assign a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The appeals court heard arguments Tuesday on the requested stay.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran afoul of the code of conduct for U.S. judges by compromising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responding publicly to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">She appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including reforms in policies, training and supervision, and she ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some precincts where most stops occur.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after a police stop.</seg>
		<seg id="10">An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Stop-and-frisk has been around for decades in some form, but recorded stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high in 2011 of 684,330, mostly of black and Hispanic men.</seg>
		<seg id="13">A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices, will mold a more trusted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Opponents say the changes would lower police morale but not crime, waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge noted she wasn't putting an end to the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its stops.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing have reacted with anger over the sentence given to the last of the plotters to face justice, saying Umar Patek should face a firing squad.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of South-East Asia's most wanted, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in jail for his role in building the explosive devices used in the bombing.</seg>
		<seg id="3">He could be released within 15 years if granted parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, although they could have pushed that the man dubbed the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; for his reputation as a master bomb-maker be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The decision has reignited painful memories for Perth mother June Corteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the destruction unleashed by Patek and his co-conspirators almost a decade ago.</seg>

		<seg id="14">He lapsed into a month-long coma in the wake of the bombing, and &quot;died&quot; three times while on life support.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hughes said Patek should have shared the same fate as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.</seg>

		<seg id="20">He had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had revealed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Leg almost hacked off: Rocker retrial</seg>
		<seg id="1">A bloody attack within the 'Rocker' scene is to be re-investigated after more than four years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Proceedings for attempted murder, grievous bodily harm and material damage, brought against two 30-year-olds have begun before the Frankfurt District Court.</seg>
		<seg id="3">They are being accompanied by strict security precautions.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The accused initially remained silent.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They are said to have been active within the Rocker scene and to have at the time belonged to the Bandidos.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Public Prosecutor accused them of having stabbed and beaten three men in a car in Finowfurt, together with unknown accomplices.</seg>
		<seg id="7">All the victims were seriously injured, with one man almost losing a leg.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The victims were said to have belonged to the competing gang, the Hell's Angels.</seg>
		<seg id="9">One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It seems that the attack was preceded by a car chase involving several cars.</seg>
		<seg id="11">According to accusations, this was part of a turf war and represented a demonstration of power.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The two accused were acquitted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the time, a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The assailants had worn masks and had not been recognised.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The Federal Supreme Court repealed the verdict following an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred the case back to the District Court for a re-trial.</seg>
		<seg id="16">One of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another offence.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Proceedings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The police inspector responsible at the time was invited as a witness.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The central point of focus was on mobile phone conversations between the accused and third parties, which the police had intercepted.</seg>
		<seg id="20">What makes things difficult is that Rockers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appearing before the court - they say absolutely nothing.</seg>
		<seg id="21">This also applies in the case of the victims.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In the first trial, only one of the victims spoke out.</seg>
		<seg id="23">When asked, Public Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial.</seg>
		<seg id="24">A further eleven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on Thursday, pressured by fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the test plane's inaugural flight about a month and a half ago, it has only flown three more times, raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Results fell short of forecasts and sent shares sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to &quot;sector perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; on Thursday with the view that the stock has limited upside over the next one or two quarters.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;While the weaker aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation,&quot; Doerksen said in a client note.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program progresses.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we suspect that the market will become more skeptical of the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first test plane was unveiled in March and took flight for the first time in September after months of delays.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But firm orders for the CSeries are moderate so far at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner's fuel efficiency and cost savings potential.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There are currently 403 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Executives also reassured analysts and media on Thursday the program was progressing according to schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The test plane didn't stay on the ground longer than anticipated,&quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Every manufacturer schedules it in a different way.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that's what we have done.</seg>
		<seg id="18">That will happen all through the flight program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test planes is expected to take flight in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Still, analysts are skeptical the first customer can begin operating a CSeries plane 12 months after its maiden flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-into-service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule apparently - reinforces our view that entry-into-service will be pushed to Q1/15,&quot; said Doerksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The world's fourth-largest planemaker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, from 83.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;In aerospace, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment,&quot; Beaudoin said.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Aerospace revenue fell 13 percent to $2 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest trainmaker, said revenue in that division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The order backlog in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The transportation division's margins were affected by execution issues in a few large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Executives said new guidance would be provided in the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would join the board, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid afternoon trading on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial planemaker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent fall in quarterly profit on Thursday.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Australian airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tablets and smart phones during take-off and landing despite moves in the US to loosen regulations covering the devices.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the way open for American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight provided they remain in &quot;airplane&quot; mode.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Passengers can already do this during the bulk of a flight but many people find it annoying to be unable to access their e-books during take-offs and landings.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Australian carriers are looking at the decision, which requires US carriers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements, but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; it said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Virgin, which has already been talking to CASA about extending the use its in-flight wi-fi entertainment system, was amenable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regulator.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;We would welcome a review by CASA into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) on our planes,&quot; a spokesman said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Qantas said it would stick with the current rules for now.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing and we have no immediate plans to change that,&quot; it said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The FAA ruling applies to American airlines.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Carriers will need to prove their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices as well as revise manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger briefings.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;Once an airline verifies the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones-at all altitudes,&quot; the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In rare instances of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safely stowed under seats or in overhead bins during take-off and landing.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: &quot;It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">Here we attempted to look at it in other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other</seg>
		<seg id="9">Prof Vallortigara said: &quot;We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He said: &quot;If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the Italian study.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Pawnbrokers shine in Singapore as middle class feel the pinch</seg>
		<seg id="1">At a pawnshop in Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga is swapping a gold bangle, ring and pair of earrings to pay her daughters&quot; school fees.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money's stuck there,&quot; Mrs Amirthalinga says.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Even though she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is insufficient, she says.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Indeed, such is demand across parts of southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her transaction, this week became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Pawning jewellery is not merely a fast way to land cash - S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Typically pawnbrokers in Singapore charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can arrange loans faster than banks.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Hence millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the squeeze from rising living costs and ballooning household and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This week Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, cited increasing household leverage, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks&quot; creditworthiness.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Malaysia topped the list at 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week narrowly emerged from technical recession.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday, data showed continued export weakness, and a softening in consumer demand.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;Bottom line is that with costs rising, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will be looking to supplement their income wherever they can,&quot; says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Historically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rush to pawn personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family jewellery.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In Singapore, about 70 per cent of items pawned at the city-state's 200 pawn outlets are gold.</seg>
		<seg id="18">People are saying &quot;the gold price looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month.</seg>
		<seg id="19">In Thailand the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Such is the growth in the pawn business that ValueMax, operator of the outlet at Bendemeer and of 15 others like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it has four shops - but outside Asia too, says Yeah Lee Ching, ValueMax's executive director.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The company will fund that by using 60 per cent of S$66m it raised this week in a listing on the Singapore stock exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="22">While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says that not only does pawning offer cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not add directly to debt.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;Customers are mortgaging items that they already own, and monetising personal assets does not increase household debt,&quot; she says.</seg>
		<seg id="24">There's an increased social acceptance of pawnbroking as a means to secure short term, secured financing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nor are the types of people who use pawnbrokers only the financially stretched.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, pawning gold bars or Rolex watches, which can command up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.</seg>
		<seg id="27">We see customers from all walks of life.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short term for business ventures or investments, or small businesses with a need to tide over their cash flow needs,&quot; says Ms Yeah.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.</seg>

		<seg id="1">As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the present winning form of the Austrian Bundesliga table-toppers, Red Bull Salzburg, the Sporting Director of the &quot;Bulls&quot; expressed equal disappointment with the referees.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;There is currently a dangerous trend, with Mane and Alan being dubbed as 'divers',&quot; he said at a press conference in Salburg on Thursday, in defence of the two tricky offensive players.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The most recent cause for Rangnick's criticism was the yellow card for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, whereby the Senegalese striker was penalised for supposed play acting - admittedly this was not justified, as shown by TV footage.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;A blatant wrong decision,&quot; commented Rangnick, who referred to Harkam as being &quot;completely out of his depth&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Harkam also played &quot;his part&quot; in the escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He firmly defended his German compatriot: &quot;In each individual situation I would have behaved in the same way as Roger Schmidt&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schmidt himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the skirmish with Hütter.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I do not know why.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;After all, I was the one who was insulted,&quot; emphasised the 46-year-old.</seg>
		<seg id="10">However, with regard to the winning run, Rangnick sang his team's praises.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There are only two words for it: Really good,&quot; he stated.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There is not a lot you can criticise.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Most of all, the manner in which the team is playing is impressive.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We must stay composed and keep it up.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer window.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There is no major reason to change anything.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;Unless a player comes forward and expresses the desire to leave the club,&quot; explained Rangnick.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A study aiming to increase the benefits to Scotland of the HS2 rail project has been announced by the UK government.</seg>
		<seg id="1">The work by HS2 Ltd suggests high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase One opens in 2026.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring the UK together.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; to work with the UK government on the plan.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phase One will consist of a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.</seg>
		<seg id="5">When Phase Two is completed, lines will run to Manchester and Leeds.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In June the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the North of England from £32.7bn to £42.6bn.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The UK government, which has been holding talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern England and Scotland.</seg>
		<seg id="8">This is to include the possibility of eventual journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is for a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">We are driving forward HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But it is also about connectivity, across the UK 18 cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh will be better connected because of HS2.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; back Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Brown said: &quot;High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across Britain.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to Scotland, creating benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line which the Scottish Government is already planning.</seg>
		<seg id="17">I look forward to reviewing the report of the investigation with UK ministers next year and together decide on the next steps.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Living with a future-oriented perspective</seg>
		<seg id="1">If truth be told, Waltraud Ries, lives a dreamy life.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in Stuttgart, with plenty of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="3">She is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Hopefully you aren't afraid of spiders?&quot; asks Waltraud Ries, pointing out a large spider on the door frame.</seg>
		<seg id="5">I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now.</seg>
		<seg id="6">But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, the reason for the desire to move is not arachnophobia, but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house, and inside their home in their old age, she explained.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Furthermore: Since undergoing a meniscus operation, the lady, in her mid-fifties, has had to experience for herself what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Only recently, she released a book on the subject of &quot;Living happily in old age - Which type of property is the best for me?&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn't work in old age,&quot; she begins to recount.</seg>
		<seg id="11">When she moved to the maisonette with her husband 20 years ago, it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Now, in her mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries has different thoughts about it.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Only other people get old, she says, smirking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Only when the psychological strain becomes severe do people give it consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="17">&quot;But at this stage it can be too late,&quot; said Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In her book, the interior decorator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;However, which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision,&quot; she explains.</seg>
		<seg id="20">There is no solution to overcoming old age.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Even if you can afford to spend your retirement in Tuscany or Brittany, you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="22">And: 'Without a sound knowledge of the local language, you can even become lonely when living the dolce vita,' added the author, providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Her models include classic care models, alternative living arrangements and the often-mentioned pensioners' living community.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In old age everyone has their quirks and ticks.</seg>
		<seg id="25">'However, this type of residential community would not be for me,' she commented with a wink.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Definitely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen.</seg>
		<seg id="27">'In old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to,' said Ries.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pensioners' residential community can work.</seg>
		<seg id="29">However, it must operate differently to the classic student digs.</seg>
		<seg id="30">And sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet,' she believes.</seg>
		<seg id="31">With this opinion she is at least not alone in the State Capital.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the citizen's Life in Old Age service in the State Capital, is also that 'the majority of old people in Stuttgart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible'.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Her agency agency advises people on the topic of 'growing old'.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Therefore the experience of the Stiftung Warentest consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept inconveniences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nowadays there are many possibilities for designing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barrier-free.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Ries recommends that all those working on the age-appropriate renovation of their house or apartment first seek out in-depth information and don't simply use the first tradesman that comes along.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Nowadays there are specialists in renovation to suit the needs of the elderly.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Even in the case of rental apartments some landlords can have this work carried out, even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat, clarified the interior designer.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, even if it is as beautiful as ever.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Waltraud Ries had to go through this experience herself.</seg>
		<seg id="41">You could of course install a stair lift inside the apartment, but the cobbled path up to the door of the apartment, featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hindrance.</seg>
		<seg id="42">She will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for herself and her husband.</seg>
		<seg id="43">She is more afraid of the move than of the spider on her front door.</seg>

		<seg id="4">A top defence lawyer who told a drugs Mr Big about a major police investigation, because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, has been jailed for three years.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Basharat Ditta, 42, would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about inquiries into his drug trafficking activities after he became compromised by his cocaine habit.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The solicitor, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and hailed by criminals as a &quot;top brief,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out at a Law Society dinner with colleagues.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Inquiries revealed Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of the Class A drug after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Over an eight month period between January and August 2011 he sought to illicitly obtain information on the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.</seg>

		<seg id="15">The lawyer's downfall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two detectives trailed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a purity of 60 per cent under the lawyer's bins in a black golf glove.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Soon after the drop off, Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta who had been out at the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The lawyer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The court heard Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards</seg>
		<seg id="20">Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine and and said he had been speaking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and argued their discussions were subject to &quot;legal privilege.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">During his arrest Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken fom him.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business.</seg>
		<seg id="23">But the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, after key arrests to tell them what detectives knew about them.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Prosecuting, Anne Whyte said: &quot;If anyone should know not to the break the law, it is a criminal solicitor.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal solicitor, having become too involved with specific clients.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer with drugs.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their lawyer.</seg>
		<seg id="28">But this went way beyond the ordinary confines of a lawyer-client relationship.</seg>
		<seg id="29">He thwarted the police's investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Mr Ditta was not honouring his profession, but dishonouring it.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He got too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Ditta denied wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to feed information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="33">But after the hearing Supt Lee Halstead from Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta turned from criminal solicitor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised criminals.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="34">His addiction to cocaine left him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organised crime groups who tasked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Solicitors should uphold the highest standards of integrity and should instil trust and confidence in the public.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Mr Ditta has betrayed this trust and attempted to hide behind the veneer of his profession.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Mr Ditta which has also seen him convicted of three counts of possession of cocaine and now perverting the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.</seg>
		<seg id="39">We will find you and put you before the courts.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Thirty five other men involved in the racket were jailed for a total of 153 years for drugs offences.</seg>
		<seg id="42">On his website Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fantasy job would be a lawyer representing clients on Death Row in America, his ultimate dinner guest as being Mohammed Ali and inequality as his motivation for work.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Council sets its sights on rail system</seg>
		<seg id="1">Should the &quot;Am Hirschen&quot; railway crossing be reconstructed at great cost, in order to increase traffic safety?</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Town Councils have decided that the answer is yes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Schiltach will have to contribute up to EUR 220,000 to the project.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The Deutsche Bahn hopes to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In particular, safety at railway crossings is to be increased - collisions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country.</seg>
		<seg id="6">If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they will be required to contribute one third of the costs, with the remainder divided between Deutsche Bahn and the Federal Government.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Schiltach's town master mason, Roland Grießhaber, explained the peculiarities of the &quot;Am Hirschen&quot; railway crossing to the Town Council.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the crossing, the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Larger vehicles, for example those that transport long logs, would be able to wait there in the event of oncoming traffic, without having to block the railway line.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Grießhaber therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course widen the adjoining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="11">This was the subject of controversial discussion in the Town Council, as some council members cast doubt over the need to widen the road: Thomas Kipp summarised the perspective of the critics with this statement: &quot;Do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mayor Thomas Haas retorted: The &quot;Hirschen&quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long logs.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Even wood from the &quot;Kuhbach&quot; area is occasionally transported via this route, as the vehicles, which measure 20 metres in length, would not be able to use the route via the Häberles Bridge, as they would not be able to make the turn on the Hauptstrasse.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Furthermore, when the Hauptstrasse is blocked, the route would also serve as a bypass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel, argued Haas.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Given that it is likely that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel will have to be reconstructed and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the &quot;Am Hirschen&quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The councillors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned widening of the road would incur.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was consented to by a majority, on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could, if required, extend the connecting road in the &quot;Bahnhofstraße&quot; direction to around 5.5 metres to accommodate oncoming traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could, on the other hand, bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the steep &quot;Geroltzhäuser Weg&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Administrative Department had Deutsche Bahn's reconstruction plans investigated by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg will be straightforward.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming stuck.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The town, as the authority responsible for road construction, would then bear responsibility for this.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are, the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consented to, argued Haas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">At this point, the risk of a train collision with a vehicle positioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway crossings, on account of the fact that there is a midpoint from which there is a good line of sight, directly alongside the stopping point.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The trains themselves, coming from the central station, must also be sufficiently slowed down so that there is no threat of collision.</seg>
		<seg id="26">According to the councillors, the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority, as the town of Schiltach would &quot;bear the brunt of the cost&quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming stuck, since the Deutsche Bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot;Vor Heubach&quot; and 'Vor Kuhbach&quot; railway crossings, for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with Deutsche Bahn, to be unproblematic.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's chief said.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;A landmark event has taken place today: Construction started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="3">This project is a key element of energy security of the whole European continent.</seg>
		<seg id="4">South Stream is meant to add diversity to Russia's export routes through Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, which hosts most of Russia's gas for Europe, adds a layer of risk to conventional routes, officials say.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a discounted rate once the entire project starts operating in 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by year's end.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</seg>

		<seg id="7">By doing away with these announcements - on average around 200 personal call-outs come through the loudspeakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be calmer in future.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;Experience has also shown that these individual announcements are relatively seldom taken notice of, and at the same time, all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them,&quot; said Kleeman while chatting to the radio broadcaster.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One could argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the vaudevillian Frank Fay, who served as the master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd, in a conversational manner.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Fay's innovation has been extended through the years, most recently by the New York Comedy Festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows at small clubs and large theatres.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Most of these headliners appeared at Carolines, and went on to greater success, to the point where they're too big to play a club,&quot; Hirsch said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an annual music-and-comedy benefit for military veterans, at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.</seg>
		<seg id="7">As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival came up through nontraditional channels, such as shows on smaller networks, like Comedy Central, FX, and Spike.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nick Kroll rose to prominence on a deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed &quot;The League&quot;) and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate has been a cast member on both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation,&quot; though she is best known for her viral video series &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the wry, racially focussed W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the festival's biggest draws will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as a standup comedian but has become an accomplished television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The meeting takes place at Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work,&quot; Steinberg said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He was telling me that, when he's here, sometimes he'll walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.</seg>

		<seg id="7">The host of old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or walking on stilts, promises plenty of fun.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Here speed and coordination are the order of the day.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For any miniature detectives, the open air museum will be offering a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at midday and 2.00 p.m. respectively.</seg>
		<seg id="10">On a tour of the premises, the children will have to work out which stories are true and which have been made up.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In addition, visitors will have the special opportunity to get to know the open air museum on a carriage journey drawn by Black Forest Chestnut horses.</seg>

		<seg id="4">During the presentation, Wolf seemed impressed by the educational pilot project.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Since 2011, there has been successful collaboration in Wälderstadt between the Support Centre, the District Grammar School and the Vocational School Complex.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He also praised the family-friendly approach within the district.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;It is important, not only to keep the family life stage in mind, but, on account of demographic change, the period spent providing long-term care and support for relatives as well,&quot; explained Wolf.</seg>
		<seg id="8">He also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care and support of relatives.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;Without support from their employer, the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termination of the employment contract,&quot; said Wolf.</seg>
		<seg id="10">However, nobody can afford to lose qualified workers,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Another, particularly important factor is that of networking between universities and companies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;After all, people who have learned of the merits of the region during their studies often remain within the region, along with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to the strengthening of the region,&quot; said the State Parliamentary President, expressing his thorough conviction.</seg>

		<seg id="14">In his opinion, the district's advantage as a location is its advantageous location in south-west Germany, in immediate proximity to France and Switzerland.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver is appealing the verdict and has been granted bail.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false claims after telling Thai police a local taxi driver, with two other men restraining her, carried out the assault in the early hours of Sunday June 10.</seg>
		<seg id="3">However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned to her hotel safely after becoming separated from her Australian boyfriend.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.</seg>
		<seg id="5">She was held in local police cells before the court hearing.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Bamford was sentenced to serve the 15-day prison term at a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in an adult women's jail.</seg>
		<seg id="7">She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has appealed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;It's obviously been a worrying time but we're hopeful to have her back home safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Bamford is appealing the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Reports in Australia said that in the meantime, she was holidaying at the resort area of Krabi in Southern Thailand.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Thai-based legal sources said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket but warned that the appeal may lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve it in an adult prison.</seg>

		<seg id="2">In addition, they have cleaned and widened the footpath, a press release announced.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The planned covering of the dilapidated house to the rear of the plot was not permitted for safety reasons, as the premises were at risk of collapsing.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Alfred Abel, who currently manages the site, arranged the 'face-lift' in cooperation with his colleague, Reinhard Domke, from the citizen's initiative.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Before the citizen's initiative project, a banner with the message &quot;We are in favour&quot; was put up.</seg>
		<seg id="6">However, this did little to distract the 20 or so members of the citizen's initiative from their project.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Their motto, on the large billboard stated &quot;We are against unfinished buildings&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Schweizer Wiese - should the huge project one day fail.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Chatting with many people passing by the &quot;construction site&quot;, it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town, although many have the same questions as the citizen's initiative regarding the scale of the planned project.</seg>
		<seg id="10">However, they are beginning to resign themselves as the town continues to stall in providing answers, said a statement from the citizen's initiative.</seg>
		<seg id="11">We have now been told that the public statements made by the Mayor are also having an impact.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In May, in the meeting of the Town Council, he said that he feared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the local referendum.</seg>

		<seg id="8">The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites, reported the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The activist group, which has been tracking the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people have died.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Of those, it said 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.</seg>
		<seg id="12">On the government side, it said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Also among the dead it said were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On July 25, the U.N. estimated 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It has not updated that figure since.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Assad's troops have been battling rebels, many of them linked to al-Qaida groups, in Safira for weeks.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides Thursday but had no specifics.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The fighting underscored the dangers the chemical weapons' inspectors face as they race against tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was &quot;now satisfied that it has verified - and seen destroyed - all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="21">It added that, &quot;no further inspection activities are currently planned.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed their first round of verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damascus.</seg>
		<seg id="23">They were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns, the inspectors said.</seg>
		<seg id="24">On Thursday, OPCW said the two locations were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">It was not immediately clear if the facility in Safira was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the OPCW's executive committee.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;I salute the fortitude and courage you've all demonstrated in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; the watchdog's director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said in comments released by the OPCW.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Now in its third year, the civil war pits the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and its security forces, which are stacked with members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.</seg>
		<seg id="29">In other developments, the Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The cause of the blast was not known, he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation, in another sign that the global probe by regulators into the suspected manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining traction.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are co-operating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3tn changes hands each day.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening probe that echoes the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-operating fully with the FCA and our other regulators,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS had turned over records of emails and instant messages to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, sent to and from a former trader.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currencies trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.</seg>
		<seg id="9">None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.</seg>
		<seg id="11">UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.</seg>
		<seg id="12">At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's competition authority Weko, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are looking at allegations that bankers colluded to move the currencies market.</seg>
		<seg id="13">HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal probes or received requests for information from regulators, said people familiar with the situation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Banks are scouring through years&quot; worth of instant messages and emails to search for instances of wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">News about the probes has rattled traders in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks' trading units in past years but which has been challenged this year as low volatility in currencies cuts opportunities for speculators.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Some bankers have tried to play down the affair by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders are saying this is not necessarily true.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A senior trader said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks&quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot;you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="18">The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse announced it had dismissed a trader at its London exchange traded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $6m loss late last year.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-operating with its regulators.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;We are confident the trader acted alone and that the matter has been contained,&quot; Credit Suisse said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Coulson used phone hacking to verify tip</seg>
		<seg id="1">Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a bogus tip about an affair involving then-home secretary Charles Clarke.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey that the News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot;attractive special adviser,&quot; Hannah Pawlby.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The newspaper tasked private investigator Glenn Mulcaire with hacking Pawlby's voicemails and &quot;door-stepped&quot; her, but Coulson also called and left her voicemails, the court heard.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, he is not the man who stands outside people's houses hoping to catch them out, he is the man who likes to put the story to people to see what they will say,&quot; Mr Edis said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He said the NotW used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The editor is personally involved in the third.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Obviously he knows about the second, surveillance, he must do.</seg>
		<seg id="8">What about the first?</seg>
		<seg id="9">Does he know about phone hacking?</seg>
		<seg id="10">He says he doesn't, we say &quot;Oh yes, he did&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW's features desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms Pawlby was told: &quot;Don't bother wasting your time, she's with Charles.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">A tape of voicemails taken from her phone on at least three occasions was seized from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer which had Ms Pawlby and her sister as &quot;Projects.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">During the period she was being investigated, Ms Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr Edis said.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Ms Pawlby's movements.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Leaving her a voicemail on June 18 2005, Coulson told her: &quot;I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow that I really would like to speak to Charles about.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former home secretary David Blunkett.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Early puberty: Growing older sooner</seg>
		<seg id="1">African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent</seg>
		<seg id="3">There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts think the obesity epidemic might be one trigger of early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced with boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Should a mother be alarmed if her daughter begins to sprout breast buds and pubic hair at 7 or 8?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- usually, this does not signal a rapid progression into full puberty,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Obvious signs of development, such as budding breasts, pubic and underarm hair and body odor are appearing sooner in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first period) over the past four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Once breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years before menarche,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test of how puberty is going to progress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;precocious&quot; when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow down or stall -- something a pediatrician can monitor closely.</seg>
		<seg id="17">A more rapid progression may warrant tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are treatments to delay early menses and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones that ultimately can lead to stunted growth and being short as an adult.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Psychosocial aspects are important, too.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz is cautious with medication but acknowledges, &quot;suppressing puberty may alleviate behavioral issues and girls' feelings of being different from peers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">The other big issue is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters having periods.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene,&quot; said Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman whose daughter started her period at 10.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Even though there were signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are lots of well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yet, there's no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Boys - like girls - are hitting puberty earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz contends the premise that holds the most weight is the epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">He helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that links body fat to the timing of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are varying explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Globally, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another conundrum: Although boys are getting facial and pubic hair at younger ages, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as it is with girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors attending the AAP conference reinforced the complexities of the topic.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to get guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean having a sooner-than-expected conversation,&quot; Kaplowitz advised.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you remain calm, your child usually will respond well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who blossom early need reassurance that, even when it happens ahead of schedule, the process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="1">In fantastic weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take on the circuit, over the hills and around the lake.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This was announced by Ulrich Knobel of the organising Illmensee Sports Club.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Among the participants there were also numerous amateur cyclists who wanted the chance to practice their hobby in a competitive environment, in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 metre climb.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Two top-class junior cyclists were also in the starting line-up for the competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the German Championships.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The pair managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">As was the case the previous year, Felix Bader managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance race</seg>
		<seg id="7">Once again, Pascal Treubel took second place.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the ladies' race it was Theresa Duelli of Team Albtraum who managed to take top place on the podium.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In second and third places were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The increasing number of riders that live or work in the area is a fantastic development.</seg>
		<seg id="11">And it was not only about top performance - the entire range of athletic ability was represented.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Participants' ages were also wide-ranging, with the youngest starters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This year, there were even more absolute top athletes at the starting line for the main race.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Four cyclists managed to break away from the top regional racers.</seg>
		<seg id="15">These included Philipp Pangerl, a semi-professional mountain biker from the Black Tusk Racing Team.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Together with a team mate, Pangerl has already twice been crowned World Champion in the 12-hour race.</seg>
		<seg id="17">This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Also competing was Roland Ballerstedt, who has already claimed two German duathlon championships.</seg>
		<seg id="19">After 45 kilometres and a climb of 900 metres, the leading riders were neck and neck on the final straight in front of the Drei-Seen-Hall.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Pangerl sped over the finish line in first place.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Only one second later, the experienced Ballerstedt managed to take second place in the overall standings.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Hermann and Warthmann then reached the finish line simultaneously to take joint third in the overall standings.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the ladies' race, Christiane Cohsmann achieved the fastest time in the main race.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Areane Blersch from Binzwangen took second place, ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Borussia Dortmund announced that there would be serious consequences.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Before Friday's Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart, the 'Ultras' responded with silence - initially.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It was an unusual, almost ghostly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmend and VfB Stuttgart, in the Signal Iduna Park.</seg>
		<seg id="4">It was mainly the chants of away fans that could be heard.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and the loudest - of BVB fans stand, was initially unusually quiet: No singing and no battle cries.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The 'Capo's' podium, the individual who usually coordinates the unison chants, remained empty.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And right at the front, on the stand, a single large flag with the text &quot;Stadium Ban Section&quot; blew in the wind.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only when goalkeeper, Roman Weidenfeller, was the first BVB player to step onto the field, did cheers briefly erupt, as is usually the case.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When his team mates followed, there was loud singing and scarves were waving -  but by no means everywhere.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In the central blocks of the south stand, blocks 12 and 13, nothing moved.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Even stadium announcer, Norbert Dickel, speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the derby victory, the win against Arsenal, the contract extension of coach Jörgen klopp - did not raise spirits.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Just five minutes before kick-off, the Capo climbed onto his podium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point, lifted with a large shout, as Dickel asked for a shout from each section of fans as usual.</seg>
		<seg id="13">As always, the south stand was left until the end, and finally the stand resumed its usual role as the loudest section of the stadium.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And as soon as the vociferous request for &quot;derby winners stand up&quot; came from the south stand upon kick-off, everything was back to normal.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Immediately before the local district derby against FC Schalke 04, some of the travelling BVB fans fired flares into the crowds of spectators and onto the pitch - and in so doing almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The kick-off was delayed on account of the chaotic scenes,</seg>
		<seg id="18">As a result, BVB Chairman Hans Joachim Watzke had invited the heads of the Dortmund Ultras fan group to his office - and if Watzke's words are to be believed, this was a rather uncomfortable meeting for the fan representatives.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;There will be massive impact for the entire Ultra movement,&quot; announced the BVB Chairman on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from organising choreography for the home match against VfB Stuttgart.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;I have banned it,&quot; he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="22">We cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding pyrotechnics in Saxony.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In addition, the Ultras were given the option of several different punishments - they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to accept.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Otherwise BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week, said Watzke.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;It will be severe,&quot; assured Watzke.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It will be interesting to see the reactions in the south stand then.</seg>

		<seg id="0">What happens with my e-mail when in transit?</seg>
		<seg id="1">E-mail is short for electronic mail.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspondence, similar to that of the traditional postal service, implemented into the design of this Internet-based service?</seg>
		<seg id="3">When designing the early Internet services, the focus lay on making communication possible.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Thus, when developing the underlying technical protocols, no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the interception-proof exchange of mail.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For this reason, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.</seg>
		<seg id="6">When user &quot;Anna&quot; sends an email to &quot;Benni&quot;, are the pair's computers then directly connected?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Anna's email program or browser first sends the mail to her service provider's mail server.</seg>
		<seg id="8">If she has a Gmail account, for example, this would be Google.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.</seg>
		<seg id="10">En route, the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the Internet.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Benni can then call up the content from his provider.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Are traditional e-mails read by third parties on their journey through the net?</seg>
		<seg id="13">The majority of e-mails are read several times by software robots en route to the recipient.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Checks are generally carried out by the sender's provider as to whether the mail contains malware as an attachment.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In addition, the providers check whether it is nuisance or unwanted spam mail, which are deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Do the robots have other tasks?</seg>
		<seg id="18">In the case of systems such as Gmail, the robots also identify the information that Google requires for displaying context-based advertising.</seg>
		<seg id="19">If Anna and Benni communicate about their upcoming holiday travels via Gmail, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Do unknown individuals also read the e-mails?</seg>
		<seg id="21">The probability of unauthorised persons reading a mail is extremely low.</seg>
		<seg id="22">However, theoretically, it is possible.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Within companies, administrators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Law enforcement authorities and Secret Services also have legal authorisation to intercept or take note of e-mails.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This may include potential illegal spying activities.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Is it possible to protect e-mails against being read?</seg>
		<seg id="27">With an encryption using the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively protected against being read.</seg>
		<seg id="28">With great technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communicating with whom.</seg>
		<seg id="29">How important are Yahoo and Google within the e-mail market in Germany?</seg>
		<seg id="30">According to a study conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013, among the main mail services in private use, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role.</seg>
		<seg id="31">While the number of Yahoo Mail accounts has fallen recently, Google's Gmail managed to grow considerably.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Germany's largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister's position.</seg>
		<seg id="1">This comes at the same time as a possible shortage of ministers: The Protestant Lutheran Regional Church of Hanover calculates that, as things stand, the current number of around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.</seg>
		<seg id="2">For the young people of today, the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Protestant Press Service.</seg>
		<seg id="3">It is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working routine.</seg>
		<seg id="4">With Burfien, the regional church has for first time commissioned a minister to work full time, endeavouring to inspire young people to study theology.</seg>
		<seg id="5">At present, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their Abitur examinations (equivalent to A levels).</seg>
		<seg id="6">Burfien puts this down to the process of secularisation: &quot;God's voice is quiet, the world is loud&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The job is characterised by great freedom and variety.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me.</seg>
		<seg id="9">As pastoral workers, ministers can be close to people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two YMCA NSW employees had been charged with child sex offences before allegations were raised against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the child sexual abuse Royal Commission has heard.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But in its opening statement to the Commission it said it had &quot;never dealt with an incident of child sexual assault within its organisation,&quot; the Commission was told.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Chief executive officer Phillip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged child pornography offences, and another when a gym instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr Hare told Gail Furness, counsel assisting the Commission, he knew about the first case but did not know about the second one.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He conceded the YMCA's opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot;there have been external audits of the YMCA that have recognised the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Evidence before the commission is that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr Hare, who started with the YMCA when he was 21, conceded management &quot;from myself down&quot; failed by recruiting Lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy breaches.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Earlier this year Lord was convicted for sexual offences against 12 boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He was jailed for a minimum of six years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion the YMCA had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Staff gave evidence they observed breaches including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, saying he loved one and letting them play with his mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified she found the YMCA Caringbah children's services manager Jacqui Barnat who supervised Lord &quot;very intimidating and hard to approach a lot of the time.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The CEO said he did not accept staff's evidence that they were uncomfortable with reporting upwards to their managers.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather, he said, their friendships with Lord clouded their judgements about reporting him.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; was &quot;not about reporting&quot; by staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr Hare said the decision to get staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA general manager of children's services Liam Whitley.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said it was intended to avoid contamination of evidence but was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">YMCA NSW was not a child safe organisation at the time Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child sex abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.</seg>
		<seg id="19">He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The hearing adjourned until December 20.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Beneath Cologne, a sewage channel from Roman times, measuring around 120 metres in length, has been preserved.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Anyone visiting Cologne cannot miss the cathedral.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The two towers, measuring around 157 metres, extend into the heavens, making it Europe's second tallest church building.</seg>
		<seg id="4">However, only a few visitors who marvel at the two ornate church towers realise that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Rainer Schulze is an expert when it comes to the Cologne underworld.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The meeting point for his tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre, right at the cathedral.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The tour begins in a somewhat unspectacular fashion: &quot;We begin in the underground car park,&quot; says Schulze.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too tall.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hurry past the Roman relics and simply drop off their car.</seg>
		<seg id="10">However, anyone who takes a closer look on parking level D2 will discover an archaeological site, cordoned off by metal railings.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Ruins measuring five metres tall, made from stones around the size of the palm of your hand, are waiting to be discovered.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;These are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century A.D,&quot; explains Schulze.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Before returning to daylight, Schulze has participants take a glance into a dark, 15-metre shaft on the upper parking level.</seg>
		<seg id="14">This is the well of the old cathedral, which is barely noticed at all these days.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The next stop on the tour is the praetorium, where participants once again descend to the depths.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.</seg>
		<seg id="17">One visitor wants to know what CCAA means.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;The abbreviation stands for &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot;, which is basically amounts to &quot;City under Roman Law and City of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the Site of the Altars for the Imperial Cult&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And the Praetorium refers to the former Governor's Palace and the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.</seg>
		<seg id="20">From the exhibition vestibule, a tunnel leads to the preserved Roman sewer, measuring around 120 metres in length.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;If you want you can take a peaceful stroll along a section of the so-called Cloaca Maxima,&quot; says Schulze, encouraging the guests.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Schulze has one more surprise.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Once he has collected the key from the information desk, he leads the group to a 16-metre, accessible shaft.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,&quot; he explains.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The Jewish congregation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the groundwater essential for ritual washing.</seg>
		<seg id="26">To this day the differing water levels caused by the varying levels of the Rhine can be read at the lower end of the Mikwe, the origins of which trace back to the eighth century.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The Mikwe is to form part of an archaeological area at the Town Hall Square, on which construction work is set to begin shortly.</seg>
		<seg id="28">However, it will be a few years before it is complete.</seg>

		<seg id="0">George Kerevan: Europe break-up gives Scots choice</seg>
		<seg id="1">Another day, another independence scare story.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the Europe-wide free-travel zone as a condition of EU membership.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Cue stories about passport controls at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.</seg>
		<seg id="4">True, the Strathclyde paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - that did not figure in the headlines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nor did anyone point out that the EU member states spend much of their time bending their formal rules if it suits them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Since Scotland isn't in the Schengen area now, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the Scots.</seg>
		<seg id="7">So, a non-story, then.</seg>
		<seg id="8">And one that is so long in the tooth it has become fossilised: I first heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; canard at least 40 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Yet there is an interesting point lost in this retelling of a whiskery old tale.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe's bidding, anyway?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Why trade London's yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Across the EU, parties which are dedicated to opposing the EU, or to scrapping the euro as a common currency, are gaining ground.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - founded only this year - came from nowhere to grab nearly five million votes in September's federal elections, thus effectively knocking the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) out of the Bundestag.</seg>
		<seg id="16">There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">However, the current economic crisis has proved a watershed.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many people to think Project Europe has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Rather, the euro system locked in its members at exchange rates favourable to German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only recourse is to slash wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity malaise.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - code for subsidising French and German energy firms at the consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity, and four times as much for gas, as in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">That is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen at Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">All the wage freezes in the world won't stop the European petrochemicals industry being hammered by cheap US shale gas.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result, revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the EU's main cheerleader.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the battered French economy struggling.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial by-election, knocking the ruling Socialists into third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they can't assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white, working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use next year's EU elections to create an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc across the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If, as is very possible, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here's my point: sometime soon growing anti-EU and anti-common currency feeling in Europe will coalesce to kill the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU won't disappear, but it will revert to something more like the loose &quot;Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations&quot; favoured by General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but France and southern Europe will revive their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I expect the UK will distance itself from this project, hoping to cosy up to the US.</seg>
		<seg id="39">However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests Britain will be left out in the Atlantic cold.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Where does this leave Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to be a region of (essentially) Little England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to get off.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland could do well inside a looser European arrangement provided we kept our own currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Co-operation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of the Nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise we should consider emulating Norway and retaining our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably-- the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.</seg>
		<seg id="47">It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence only to accept austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="0">FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make cell phone calls)</seg>
		<seg id="1">Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices gate-to-gate to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cellphones - under much-anticipated new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers shouldn't expect changes to happen immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines will have to show the FAA how their airplanes meet the new guidelines and that they've updating their flight crew training manuals and rules for stowing devices to reflect the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among the airliners who have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices once a plane's door closes.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They're not supposed to restart them until the planes reach 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane descends to land and not restart them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use the devices during takeoffs, landings and taxiing, the FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most new airliners and other planes that have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet the criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;Once the new policy is safely implemented - and we're going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win-win,&quot; Glading said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We're frankly tired of feeling like 'hall monitors' when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, text or download data will still be prohibited below 10,000 feet, the agency said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be told to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So, still no Words With Friends, the online Scrabble-type game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was famously booted off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">And heavier devices such as laptops will continue to have to be stowed because of concern they might injure someone if they go flying around the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In-flight cellphone calls also will continue to be prohibited.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month, National Transportation Safety Board Mark Rosenker, a CBS News national transportation safety expert, said that cell phones are still considered a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;Cell phones, that really is an issue, not just because potentially it could create interference with navigational devices, but we do know, according to the FCC, that it could interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air,&quot; Rosenker said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Pressure has been building on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., contend there is no valid safety reason for the prohibitions.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to enforce as use of the devices has become ubiquitous.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of their day.</seg>
		<seg id="31">New airliners are far more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi use at cruising altitudes to passengers for several years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority of airliners should qualify for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">E-readers, for example, emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But transmissions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers' use of the devices has been Amazon.com.</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, company officials loaded an airliner full of their Kindle e-readers and flew it around to test for problems but found none.</seg>
		<seg id="40">FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether use of the devices presents any risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes interference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots to support that the devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of those reports are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">However, the committee recommended the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut off devices during instrument landings in low visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense accommodations for a traveling public now bristling with technology.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We're pleased the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety and security,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.</seg>

		<seg id="2">The presenter established one thing right from the outset: The most important thing when it comes to ham are the legs of pork - turbo fattening does not provide a good basis for this.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Can ham bought in a supermarket be as good as a quality product?</seg>
		<seg id="4">Uli, boss of the large ham factory in Schwarzwald, explained to Jumbo how the Bonndorf company, &quot;Adler&quot;, operates.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;Germany's most-loved ham,&quot; said Jumbo, presenting the Black Forest ham.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He could only enter the factory when wearing hair protection and a white coat.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Jumbo also had to first disinfect his hands before he could reach for the microphone.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Jumbo seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in Waldshut</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;Here they work with huge quantities,&quot; commented the television producers, astonished by the mass production of Black Forest ham.</seg>
		<seg id="10">16,000 joints of meat per week speak for themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Weight, fat content and colour: Uli explained what was required for the best quality.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The majority of the pigs are slaughtered at six months old.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Television with standards?</seg>
		<seg id="14">Even specific details such as the pH value of the meat play a role.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;I would be curious what would happen if you were to measure Roberto Blanco,&quot; said Jumbo cynically.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here the standard of private television production is presented in its purest form.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Nonetheless, it is worth watching.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The viewer sees that joints are still carved by hand.</seg>
		<seg id="20">After all: Black Forest ham traditionally arrives on the shelf boneless.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The secret of the ham is the mix of herbs combined with salt.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The appearance of the smoking tower and furnace remind Jumbo of a submarine.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The trick: Here fir branches in the smoker provide the special flavour of Black Forest ham.</seg>
		<seg id="24">After 20 days in the smoke, the ham is finally almost black.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;And now the slice will disappear inside Jumbo,&quot; he said, announcing his sampling of the product.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;That is really delicious,&quot; said the TV star in conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="27">All those involved will be happy with that evaluation.</seg>

		<seg id="1">With a slender squad, the TSV Freudenstadt Herren I team (Men's First Team) stepped into the Schiller School Gymnasium in Reutlingen to face TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb region.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Alb men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team.</seg>
		<seg id="3">However, it soon became evident that, due in part to their age, they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the Freudenstadt team.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Gönningen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-positioned offensive moves.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming cleanly over the net from Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and their blocking game was not up to scratch.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Clear victories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all areas.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Faced with this overwhelming and match-determining performance, the third set was won following a somewhat tame and spiritless performance, for a final score of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).</seg>

		<seg id="11">They produced a hard-fought two-hour match.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;We want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible,&quot; said Mayor Jens Häußler, opening the citizen's information event regarding the flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Around 80 participants came to the Gemeindehalle (community hall) to have the planned measures explained to them, to express their concerns and submit ideas.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Häußler made clear: &quot;The final decisions will be made by the members of the Town Council&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Häußler commented that the flood that found Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009, was a decisive event in raising the question of protective measures for the future.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A river basin study was commissioned in collaboration with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which now forms the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The goal is the protection of as many developed plots of land as possible,&quot; said Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floods, which statistically occurs every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Climate change is taken into account in the form of an allowance of 15 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="9">In expert circles this is referred to as &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The masses of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,000-year flood.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;There is no such thing as absolute protection, but we can attempt to make a relative improvement,&quot; said Häußler.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million €must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the town can count on a State subsidy of around 70 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="13">However, Häußler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed.</seg>
		<seg id="14">In order to develop such a concept, the town is reliant on the cooperation of its citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In a best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Among other measures, the protection concept, which (we reported) has already been presented to the Town Council during the past week, plans local measures in the tributary to the River Irm, running from the Stammheim Valley.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In conjunction with the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Among others, the question was raised as to why embankments and detention reservoirs are no longer planned to protect the location.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Gregor Kühn, technical planner at the commissioned engineering company, Hügelsheim-based 'Wald und Corbe', who presented the concept, emphasised that it required the interplay of all proposed measures, in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Furthermore, the most economic solution must be found, said Joachim Wald of Wald und Corbe.</seg>
		<seg id="22">There was resentment among local residents of the old town, who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the overflowing of the canal network, even during normal thunderstorms.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken.</seg>
		<seg id="24">However, Häußler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flood protection, and these must not be confused.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can withstand rainfall events every two to three years.</seg>
		<seg id="26">To make the sewerage channels wider would gobble up millions.</seg>

		<seg id="1">One that invites you to linger a while and to come again.</seg>
		<seg id="2">One that wants to get its name out there.</seg>
		<seg id="3">According to dictionaries, déjà vu is defined as a psychological phenomenon, which expresses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the Opschlag in Kleve County, with a view of the Rhein-Waal University, it doesn't always have to remain a pure déjà vu feeling.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Ultimately, this is precisely the aim of the café with the wonderful name: to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a recurring basis, not just theoretically, but tangibly.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Because it is fun and simply beautiful.</seg>
		<seg id="7">A glance into the internal workings at Opschlag 8 gives the onlooker a positive feeling right from the outset.</seg>
		<seg id="8">With its ultra-modern yet cosy café ambience, it looks like a place designed to make you feel good.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The team here, with business founders, Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm, spoils guests with a wide range of coffees and cocktails.</seg>
		<seg id="10">In addition to this, there are delicious cakes or freshly baked baguettes, filled to order.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs prior to opening the chic café on the Opschlag: They previously managed the &quot;Art Lounge&quot; in Kranenburg.</seg>

		<seg id="13">Not least through university customers.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;We don't have a specific target group,&quot; emphasises Daniel Büttner.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In actual fact, here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age brackets.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Speaking of café lovers...</seg>

		<seg id="0">Jet makers feud over seat width with big orders at stake</seg>
		<seg id="1">A row has flared up between leading plane makers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its U.S. arch-rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes as plane makers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the November 17-21 event.</seg>
		<seg id="5">How the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is 9 or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; jet designs.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing says its revamped &quot;777X&quot; will hold 406 people based on economy seats more than 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out 9 abreast.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Plane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled &quot;Would You Accept This?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">As diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to U.S. Health Department Data.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The waist of the average 21st-century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened &quot;jet set&quot; was narrower.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says it has commissioned research suggesting an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes Airbus's figures on seat measurements and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It also says research shows cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">For flyers it is about more elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $700-billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Boeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original 9-abreast 777 design.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;The reason Boeing are doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="29">On the other hand, analysts say full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,&quot; said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.</seg>
		<seg id="33">While boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but says it has not yet sold it.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Until recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Without the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales.</seg>

		<seg id="0">According to dictionaries, veganism is a sub-category of vegetarianism, yet the two do differ considerably.</seg>
		<seg id="1">For while vegetarians allow themselves to consume cream tarts, ice cream or a strong Edam, these indulgences are off the menu for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Milk, cheese, egg - alongside avoiding meat and fish, vegans refrain from eating all products of animal origin - even honey is not permitted.</seg>
		<seg id="3">You might ask what is left, however, upon closer inspection the world of vegan nutrition is characterised by great resourcefulness.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;Spreads are very popular,&quot; explained Ute Henkelmann the owner of the local health food store, which provides a host of special products for vegans.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store on &quot;Domgasse&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The New Zealander has been vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he can find (almost) everything that he needs to get by. &quot;In 1997 I adjusted my diet and became a vegetarian&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the turn of the millennium I took the next step and became vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;However, it wasn't just the diet that convinced me, but also my choice of shoes,&quot; said Proctor, who prefers artificial leather over normal leather.</seg>
		<seg id="9">He realised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products.</seg>
		<seg id="10">First and foremost, being vegan is a matter of ethics.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I don't want animals to have to die for me,&quot; said Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which applies to all their consumer behaviour.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Rather than missing burgers, scrambled eggs or gummi bears, the vegan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really inspire him.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;It is a double bonus,&quot; says Proctor now, &quot;in actual fact being vegan is not about doing without, it's not about asceticism, but rather it is an enhancement&quot;. Regarding the assumption that when you convert your diet you are reducing your choice of meal options, Proctor puts this down to force of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well-intentioned attempt failing.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;The temptation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up, similar to with smoking,&quot; says Proctor, providing a comparison.</seg>
		<seg id="16">And he argues: &quot;Certain flavours are not linked to animal produce&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Often it is the herbs or the type of preparation that provide the flavour.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;You can, however, create the same effect in other ways,&quot; explains the vegan.</seg>
		<seg id="19">For example, when attending a barbecue party, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He ensures a balanced, varied diet, whereby everything should also have a good hearty flavour.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Of course you want to have something with a bit of bite, that is fair enough.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;It should be tasty, but this doesn't necessarily mean animal-based food,&quot; said Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He has not suffered any damage to his health or eating disorders - another wide-spread assumption.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Converting has had a positive effect for me.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I do not consume any foreign cholesterol and have increased my vitamin intake.</seg>
		<seg id="26">There are top athletes who also have an exclusively vegan diet.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;My blood values are excellent - I have myself checked on a regular basis,&quot; revealed Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Many critics of veganism warn in particular of the lack of vitamin B12.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Because animals are fed on fodder instead of grazing, it is dubious whether the vitamin B12 content in meat sold in freezers is actually high,&quot; commented Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="30">For vegans there is also the option of taking the co-enzyme in the form of tablets.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;My B12 values are fine,&quot; he explained.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Proctor does not have to travel far to buy food.</seg>
		<seg id="33">There are basic foodstuffs available everywhere, and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.</seg>
		<seg id="34">I can find everything I need locally.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I only purchase special items now and again.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;Many people overlook the fact that even though ready-made vegan products are expensive, it is well-known that this is also the case for &quot;normal&quot; ready-made products.</seg>
		<seg id="37">In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.</seg>
		<seg id="38">&quot;In home cooking, there is much to be discovered - with a few minor tweaks you can achieve good, if not sometimes better results,&quot; said Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Margarine in place of butter, a little more baking powder and bicarbonate of soda in place of egg - Proctor has even managed to astonish his in-laws with his vegan cheese cakes.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The vegan adds new spice to family parties.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When you cook together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;The situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves,&quot; said Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Of course he has already met with scepticism.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Do you not like my food any more?</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?&quot; - as a vegan you have to be tactful in such matters.</seg>
		<seg id="46">&quot;I do not disapprove of people, I am part of this society,&quot; said Proctor, explaining that he was not choosing a life of isolation.</seg>
		<seg id="47">And on closer observation, the everyday world does not appear quite so 'un-vegan' - and vegans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Fast food is also permitted.</seg>
		<seg id="49">Chips are available everywhere!</seg>
		<seg id="50">&quot;Many doner kebab houses offer falafel, or even vegetarian Yufka,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="51">In a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all just a question of habit.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Restaurants are slowly adapting to things.</seg>
		<seg id="53">&quot;When I began eating a vegan diet 13 years ago, things were even more difficult,&quot; says the New Zealander, and he points out: &quot;You have to talk with people, make them aware&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="54">&quot;If enough requests are made, they will perhaps be inclined to expand their menus,&quot; he hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="55">There are vegan restaurants opening up, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Proctor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Essentially, vegan dishes are for everyone.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Anyone can eat them, they are the exact opposite of exclusive.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, as they rule others out,&quot; assessed Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scandals from the outset,&quot; says Proctor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">However, purchasing vegan products can be difficult to start with.</seg>
		<seg id="62">OInce you come to understand that peanuts, in particular, may also contain animal additives as a colourant, people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of ethics with so many hurdles and pitfalls.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Therefore, for this reason and others, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book. &quot;Veganissimo - Tierische Inhaltsstoffe und ihre Alternativen&quot; (Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives) explains the many ingredients hidden in both foodstuffs and cleaning agents.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;You gradually develop an internal scanner and you know which symbols and logos you have to look out for&quot;. Proctor has learned that &quot;it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or stumble&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="65">Veganism is an important moral compass, which has an effect on your consciousness.</seg>
		<seg id="66">Perhaps he won't manage to help you break old habits altogether, but at least he manages to teach consumers to critically question their habits.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a cigarette.</seg>
		<seg id="2">A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice against nicotine addiction for life.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Further tests are needed before starting human trials, which would take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the early signs are good.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods on the market today, but find their nicotine addiction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches,&quot; Prof Cornell said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry the genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then start to make a steady stream of the antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The antibodies hunt down any nicotine molecules in the bloodstream, neutralising them before they reached the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests, vaccinated mice who were subsequently given nicotine continued with their normal activity.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But mice who had not been given the vaccine &quot;chilled out,&quot; say the researchers, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The jabs had to be given so frequently to keep antibody levels topped up that they proved expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be far lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Prof Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But more likely it would be used by smokers to quit.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know if they start smoking again, they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them kick the habit,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">British scientists said the results were interesting but warned far more research was needed.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark end of political strife in Egypt.</seg>
		<seg id="2">ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; as he took the oath of office to become the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.</seg>
		<seg id="3">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He took the oath before the court's 18 black-robed judges in its Nile-side seat built to resemble an ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during a solemn ceremony shown live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has spent most of the 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organisation harshly targeted by successive governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building as Morsi arrived shortly after 11am local time in a small motorcade.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only several hundred supporters gathered outside the court to cheer the new president and, in a departure from the presidential pomp of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly halted to allow his motorcade through on the usually busy road linking the city centre with its southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Derided as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic &quot;spare tyre,&quot; his personal prestige has surged since his victory and his delivery of a Friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of Islamists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Morsi later travelled to Cairo University where he was to make his inauguration address.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Having been a singer for 60 years, Hubert Wermter's story with the Cäcilia Male Choral Society is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was ceremonially honoured.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As per usual, Hubert Wermter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice choir.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from singing with the choir, which has achieved much more than popularity during this period.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Wermter has also been active within the association, serving as a member of the committee for 28 years, among other roles.</seg>
		<seg id="5">For his commitment and loyalty to the organisation, he has also received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Lay Pastor acting on behalf of the Cäcilian Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with an Association Certificate and a letter of commendation signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst - the choir also serves as a church choir.</seg>
		<seg id="6">His choir colleagues presented him with a German Choral Association certificate and an engraved pewter plate.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Aside from honouring Hugo, the 31st Autumn Festival progressed as usual: Alongside the Betra Male Voice Choir, the Salzstetten Choral Club, the Baisingen Choral Division and the Local Music Society, the Vollmaringen singers delivered a colourful blend of different choral and song styles, which entertained the 400 or so visitors.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The Vollmaringen Male Voice Choir got things running with atmospheric songs such as &quot;Im Weinparadies&quot; and &quot;Lustig, ihr Brüder&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They had also prepared a short serenade as a tribute to their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's &quot;Bundeslied&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The Betra Male Voice Choir also sang classic choral pieces such as &quot;Jägerwerben&quot; by Julius Wengert, &quot;Weit, weit weg&quot; by Hubert Goisern and the folk song &quot;Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="11">With its mixed choir and its ladies' ensemble - the &quot;Impulschor&quot; (Impulse Choir), the Salzstetten Choral Club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The mixed choir carried listeners away to foreign lands with the Neapolitan folksongs &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; and &quot;Eviva Espana&quot; by Antos Gus, while the &quot;Impulschor&quot; also drew on foreign languages: &quot;Liberatio&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; were included on their programme.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The Choral Division of the Baisingen Sports Club returned to its home ground with &quot;Was isch der Schwob?&quot; by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's &quot;Bierlied&quot;, while the Vollmaringen Music Society provided the crowning musical conclusion.</seg>
		<seg id="14">For children, there was a small auxiliary programme - &quot;Oma Hanne&quot; (Grandma Hanne), a.k.a Hannelore Stollsteimer, performed a 'Kasperl' theater (similar to Punch and Judy) and read some stories, which kept the children entertained throughout the afternoon.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers to store carry-on luggage on board their flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, so small bags under the seat will still be free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, $100 if travelers wait to pay until they're at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get travelers to take care of the charge in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We don't want to charge that,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airlines began charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage stashed in overhead bins, meaning those bins often run out of space.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">O'Malley said the new charge is not really about raising money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">It's about Frontier's most loyal customers making it very clear that finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website won't have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">That means one passenger in line at a Frontier gate might get to bring a bag on for free, while the next person in line might owe $100 for a similar bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until summer, though a date hasn't been set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often grumble about baggage charges and other fees, but airlines love them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that luggage costs money to handle, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street view the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Most haven't touched carry-on bag fees, though.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. started the first carry-on fee three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air later followed.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks add-on fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former executive with Midwest Airlines, flew Spirit recently and wondered what he'd find at the gate as passengers encountered Spirit's unusual carry-on bag fee.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my airline career,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I was expecting to see gnashing of teeth and a fight breaking out at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and it boarded lickety-split.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said passengers who get soda or juice can keep the whole can, and it will give coffee refills for free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">It will still give away water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Frontier's move to charge the carry-on fee if passengers don't buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to steer customers toward its own website.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Airlines pay online travel sellers such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">That has given all airlines an incentive to steer passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September it began giving half as many frequent flier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday it slashed the mileage award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the Frontier website.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue dropped 9 percent and its flying capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic has been trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of selling the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the pupils of the Schwarzwald Grammar School got to know the American city of New York.</seg>
		<seg id="2">After an eight-hour flight, they headed straight for Brooklyn Bridge, via which the heart of the city, Manhattan, can be reached on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="3">From here there is a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is particularly impressive in the evening light.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Due to the time difference, the pupils had been on the go for almost 24 hours, however, true to the slogan, &quot;the city never sleeps&quot;, the day was rounded off with a trip to Times Square.</seg>
		<seg id="5">In spite of a shutdown, they were able to visit the Statue of Liberty on the second day, and climb the statue on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They then moved on to the Financial District, via Wall Street, to visit the 9/11 memorial.</seg>
		<seg id="7">On the third day, the pupils were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the Empire State Building, enjoying the views from a height of 373 metres.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They then made their way through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets, via the Rockerfeller Center, to Central Park, which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the Autumn sun.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Ga., was found Jan. 11 stuck in an upright mat propped behind the bleachers inside his high school gym.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson died in a freak accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;They absolutely think their son was murdered,&quot; Benjamin Crump, an attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="5">They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,&quot; Crump said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They think this is a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;They sent their son to school with a book-bag and he was returned to them in a body bag,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="9">U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.</seg>
		<seg id="10">What was the cause of death?</seg>
		<seg id="11">Was his death the result of a crime?</seg>
		<seg id="12">Moore said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">I will follow the facts wherever they lead.</seg>
		<seg id="14">My objective is to discovery the truth.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;I am of the opinion that a sufficient basis exists&quot; for a formal investigation, he said.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="17">A second autopsy, however, listed a different cause of death, according to Moore.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Moore added that if he uncovers sufficient evidence to warrant a criminal or civil rights investigation into the death of Johnson he will ask the FBI to conduct it.</seg>

		<seg id="0">John Kerry says US spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately&quot; in unprecedented admission</seg>
		<seg id="1">John Kerry has indicated a softening of the U.S's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its spying has &quot;reached too far inappropriately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Secretary of State also admitted that he'd been guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on &quot;automatic pilot&quot; as incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities emerged.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The leaks have put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Speaking to an open government conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There is no question that the President and I and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there, going back to World War Two and to the very difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="5">He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S government to admit that US spying had crossed the line, but emphasised that no one's rights had been abused.</seg>
		<seg id="6">He said: &quot;In some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse.</seg>
		<seg id="8">I assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He added: &quot;We're dealing in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">There is radical extremism in the world that is hell-bent and determined to try to kill people and blow people up and attack governments.</seg>
		<seg id="12">So what if you were able to intercept that and stop it before it happens?</seg>
		<seg id="13">We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we've been able to learn ahead of time of the plans.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help address concerns abroad about alleged U.S. spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;It's really important for U.S. national security interests for Europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-terrorism endeavors,&quot; Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="17">And I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in combatting terrorism, notwithstanding their anger over these NSA programs.</seg>
		<seg id="18">News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone and those of up to 34 other world leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The national intelligence director, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it's commonplace on both sides.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office is arranging the congressional trip, expected to take place this year, and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Names of other participating lawmakers were to be released in coming days.</seg>
		<seg id="23">He said the itinerary is still being worked out.</seg>
		<seg id="24">While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some &quot;tough love&quot; will also be dispensed.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He said European leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of espionage programs they've used for years themselves.</seg>
		<seg id="26">&quot;While we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to come to terms with the fact that we're not the only ones that are out there spying,&quot; Murphy said.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is scheduled to head this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address rancor over U.S. strategies in the Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as U.S. surveillance activities.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave scheme because his daughters might get pregnant and benefit from it.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The mining magnate, who is in a dispute about paying a $6 million carbon tax bill, made the claim as he tried to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years.</seg>
		<seg id="2">There were 30 proposals to choose from, five of which are still in the running.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Distant worlds.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets near other stars.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Whether or not life exists on at least some of these, no-one knows.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The choice is a difficult one: Should we search for gravitational waves?</seg>
		<seg id="7">Or instead conduct research into the origin of the cosmos?</seg>
		<seg id="8">Or search for planets similar to the Earth and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?</seg>
		<seg id="9">These are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the European Space Agency, ESA.</seg>
		<seg id="10">For their &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects, which should greatly advance research.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The budget for &quot;L-Missions&quot; such as this lies at around one billion Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The projects are planned to start in 2028 and 2034.</seg>
		<seg id="13">At the beginning of September, the elite in the field of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.</seg>
		<seg id="14">30 ideas were up for debate, of which five have now made it onto the short list.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Numerous panels are assessing the proposals, posing questions to the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Over the coming days, a final decision is to be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In total, four main questions were chosen by the ESA, to which the missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; programme, initiated in 2007, are to find the answers.</seg>
		<seg id="18">What are the conditions required for the formation of planets and life?</seg>
		<seg id="19">The precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of the planets that orbit these stars - lie in proverbial darkness.</seg>
		<seg id="20">A large infra-red telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life exist there?</seg>
		<seg id="22">In order to pursue this question, the &quot;Cheops&quot; space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in proximity to us will be investigated in greater detail.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The possibilities are, however, limited - Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="24">With larger instruments, astronomers could map planets similar to Earth and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres, and thus search for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: gases that serve as an indicator for biological activity.</seg>
		<seg id="25">How does the solar system function?</seg>
		<seg id="26">This question should also provide information regarding the preconditions for the origins of life.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The magnetic activity of a star, the interaction of its magnetic field and the emitted particle radiation play an important role.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system, to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere.</seg>
		<seg id="29">With the &quot;Solar Orbiter&quot;, the ESA has already approved an M-class mission (for which the budget stands at around half a million Euro) to address this matter.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The probe is to be launched in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.</seg>
		<seg id="32">They want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The ESA is planning that the first of the total of three L-Missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; programme will address this subject.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The &quot;Juice&quot; (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is planned to begin its journey in 2022.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Eight years later it will reach Jupiter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.</seg>
		<seg id="36">What are the basic physical laws of the Universe?</seg>
		<seg id="37">Outer space offers many possibilities for studying substances under extreme conditions and thus examining whether the laws of nature, as known to us, are still valid there.</seg>
		<seg id="38">There may also be deviations that could show physicians the path to a new theory, under the umbrella of which all known natural laws could be united.</seg>
		<seg id="39">How did the universe come about and what does it consist of?</seg>
		<seg id="40">13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Alongside the materials familiar to us, from which stars, planets and life forms such as ourselves are composed, there exists dark matter, the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Thus far, researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.</seg>
		<seg id="43">With &quot;Euclid&quot;, the ESA has already approved an M-mission, planned to commence in 2020.</seg>
		<seg id="44">With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Proposals that are in the running...</seg>
		<seg id="46">Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The proposal with the best chance of approval as an L-mission, in the opinion of many experts, is &quot;E-Lisa&quot;, a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gravitational waves.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Many physicians perceive this to entail changes in the structure of space-time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="49">To date they have never been proved to exist.</seg>
		<seg id="50">The scientists behind the project hope that Elisa could achieve this.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The mission involves placing a detector, consisting of two or three probes, in outer space.</seg>
		<seg id="52">Unlike systems on Earth, it could also prove gravitational waves created during the Big Bang, and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the cosmos.</seg>
		<seg id="53">Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission place: a large X-ray telescope called &quot;Athena&quot;, which among other things would research black holes, &quot;Icy Planets&quot;, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;prism&quot;, a mission for the measurement of cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot;, which would find and investigate planets similar to Earth.</seg>
		<seg id="54">Among others, proposals that have already been ruled out include proposals for bringing samples back from Mars, conducting research on the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as proposals in the area of solar physics.</seg>

		<seg id="3">One in 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The CDC found the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The guide contains information for schools on how to make faculty and staff aware of children's food allergies, and how to handle them should an allergic reaction occur.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It also recommends schools have epinephrine stocked -- the EpiPen brand auto-injector being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.</seg>
		<seg id="7">State legislatures have recently been updating rules to allow schools to stock epinephrine more easily.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who are having an allergic reaction.</seg>

		<seg id="4">A puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to be reunited with Ruby and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They had searched frantically for their missing dog and posted appeals on social networking sites after she had ran into the quarry following the minor accident.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At around 2.15pm on Wednesday, an eagle-eyed dog walker spotted Ruby on the ledge in the quarry, stranded 50ft up.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A Technical Rescue Team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled down to rescue Ruby and used a pet tube to transport her up the cliff.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a precarious situation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">She was right in the middle of the cliff face - 50ft from the top and bottom.</seg>
		<seg id="12">She did not move a muscle during the rescue - she was frozen solid.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But she is fine now.</seg>
		<seg id="14">She was eating biscuits afterwards.</seg>
		<seg id="15">This was a very unusual call-out.</seg>

		<seg id="18">The potential was there that she could have been very seriously injured or worse.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Ruby was taken to the vets for a check-up and was found to be fine other than exhaustion and dehydration.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a &quot;super tunnel&quot; intended for drug smuggling.</seg>
		<seg id="2">As announced by the US Customs Authorities, the pipe between Tijuana and San Diego, measuring more than 500 metres in length, was equipped with electricity, a railway track and a ventilation system.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Three suspects were detained in relation to the discovery, with eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to the details provided, the tunnel had not yet been put into use.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;These cartels are stupid if they think that they can dig through under the radar,&quot; said the US Attorney for the District of Southern California, Laura Diffy, at a press conference held in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Referring to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: &quot;If you continue to build and attempt to use these tunnels, we are determined to make this a big waste of your dirty money&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in Mexico.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Built by experts</seg>
		<seg id="10">Due to the elaborate configuration of the tunnel, investigators are working on the assumption that it was build by architects and engineers and that the construction took around one year.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The railway system was equipped in such a way that electrically powered carts could be used on it.</seg>
		<seg id="12">On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border.</seg>
		<seg id="13">According to the authorities, a ladder runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The tunnel has a cross-section measuring 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres across.</seg>
		<seg id="15">It would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Two of the suspects were detained in conjunction with the cocaine find.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The third, a Mexican, was detained due to the seizure of the marijuana.</seg>
		<seg id="18">All three face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, according to the authorities.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Since 2006, eight tunnels of this type have been discovered, the press conference in San Diego continued.</seg>
		<seg id="20">However, this was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.</seg>
		<seg id="22">This shows the &quot;desperation&quot; of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Squad in San Diego.</seg>
		<seg id="23">They will do anything to make it to the USA.</seg>
		<seg id="24">No specific details were given regarding those detained, but it is reported that at least one is Mexican</seg>

		<seg id="1">Amid a firestorm of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, unambiguous promise that &quot;if you like your health plan, you can keep it.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="2">With hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have slammed the president in recent days for misleading the American public.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Yesterday, Obama tweaked his original pledge.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;For the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works, you can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Addressing what he called the &quot;flurry in the news&quot; about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans receiving these notices to shop for new coverage in the marketplace.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Most people are going to be able to get better, comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;You're going to get a better deal,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn't meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Sebelius, who is overseeing implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace has gone &quot;miserably&quot; since October.</seg>

		<seg id="13">An exasperated Sebelius uttered that phrase, caught by a hot mic, to an aide seated behind her at yesterday's House hearing following a contentious exchange with Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., over whether she should be required to enroll in Obamacare.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Parents of Intersex Kids Can Pick 'Gender Undetermined'</seg>
		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="2">No longer will newborns be rigidly assigned to male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law doesn't require parents to declare any gender for such children, allowing parents to declare gender &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make hasty decisions on sex-assignment surgery for newborns, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later, &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.</seg>
		<seg id="7">An estimated one in 2,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed genitalia.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it's better to use the best available information to assign it then to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undertaking surgery, if at all.</seg>
		<seg id="11">New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in issues of gender identification, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersex children pose ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;Some people have life-endangering conditions that require surgery, but most kids do not,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can make a gender assignment without surgery, and then see how identity develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Nobody can answer the questions about why this happens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It's like the mystery of why people are gay.</seg>
		<seg id="18">A report filed to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological makeup, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and stature; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or in chromosomal structures and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the realm of employment, as well as levels of harassment, violence and bias crimes.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Gender nonconforming boys now have special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Already, Australia and Nepal allow adults to mark male, female or a &quot;third gender&quot; on their official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the world's first recognized &quot;genderless&quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">German passports will have a third designation other than M or F -- X, for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from that strongly Catholic country signed a petition for &quot;gender theory&quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, writing that &quot;as the world is being dragged into a new state, where gender is a choice, but sexual activity is not, we reverse two more pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">One Maryland mother of a newborn also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see babies assigned gender at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;Parenting is stressful enough without extra limitations, especially if you don't know the gender of your child,&quot; she told the parenting website.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and certainty.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named for the handsome Greek god who had dual sexuality.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And as little as a decade ago, the medical community thought of gender as a slate that could be erased and then redrawn.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now, many are challenging the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors can sometimes get it wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about their gender assignment when they grow up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;Back in the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When these kids were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The prevailing theory on how to treat children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was malleable.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental cues -- how parents raised a child -- interacted with a child's genes and hormones to shape whether the person identified as male or female.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one 1966 case, known as &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories became controversial.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to have the child fully castrated, removing his testicles, as well, and to raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Money presented the case as a successful case of transition, but it was not,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was around 15, he transitioned back to a boy and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But at 38, he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that now some doctors are still &quot;practicing that model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these gender surgeries have come forward &quot;not happy with the outcome.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors couldn't be sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never live a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as a man.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organ and testes were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He was given female hormones at age 12.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I wasn't a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">At 18, he was set for a vaginoplasty.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But depressed and knowing something was wrong, he demanded medical records.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he found out was horrifying.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth -- and no one ever told me.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born with a DSD that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his genitals.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, taking testosterone shots and having his breasts removed.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Surgery rendered him infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize perceptions of those who are intersex.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director for California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law &quot;invites labeling and stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;A lot of activists are concerned that what the German rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an 'undetermined,'&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid it will encourage intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We think a better process is assigning male or female sex, then waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we haven't seen how the law will play out, so all we can do is speculate.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">German law is about assigning it at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">That is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they are grown, they can make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a disorder of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said the German law will &quot;empower&quot; both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Baratz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now at 29, Katie is married and at the University of Pennsylvania, a resident in child psychiatry.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Though she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.</seg>
		<seg id="75">&quot;The law gives parents some space not to have to rush into making decisions themselves,&quot; said Baratz.</seg>
		<seg id="76">It gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write 'male' or 'female.'</seg>
		<seg id="77">This way, you are OK -- raise the child, love the child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We don't have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;It brings the children into the decision and takes away the anxiety that motivates parents because they don't feel they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">Ultimately, the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that's a wonderful thing.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It empowers children to make the decision for themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="7">Furthermore, the role of the old fisherman is a character role, through and through, which Janson masters excellently.</seg>

		<seg id="4">The ice cream reacts with the eater's tongue - raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Chris says because the ice cream lights up when it reacts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Charlie, founder of the &quot;Lick Me I'm Delicious&quot; ice cream company, said: &quot;It is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production, so £200 gets you about 2g of the stuff.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="7">The protein we are using in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.</seg>
		<seg id="8">So as your mouth warms up the protein it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.</seg>
		<seg id="9">We have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over Halloween because it gives that wonderful glow effect.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have made because the jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.</seg>
		<seg id="11">So each scoop costs me around £140.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It tastes pretty good though.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famed for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.</seg>
		<seg id="14">But his next creation is set to be even more ambitious.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He said: &quot;I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">It is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals which make up the ice cream, but I reckon we will find a way of doing it.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists</seg>

		<seg id="1">At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday 21 October, in the Neues Museum des Schlosses (New Castle Museum), the focus will be on the topic of &quot;To hell with Hell - Theological reflections on how we now approach the notion of end times&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The speaker will be Johanna Rahner.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant churches in Salem, the Salem Castle and the Lake Constance District Cultural Office.</seg>
		<seg id="4">At the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot;end times&quot; after death.</seg>
		<seg id="5">While people in past centuries were overly conscious of it, focusing on the pictures of heaven and hell &quot;that up until now have defined our ideas&quot;, contemporary prophetic teaching on the hope of consummation is characterised more by a certain bashfulness, or even speechlessness.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;The greater hope has been well and truly cast out of Christians by religious critics,&quot; said the speaker.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They have &quot;provided us with so many question marks, that we seem to have lost our exclamation marks&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Johanna Rahner continued: &quot;However, the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Associated with this is the matter of that longing, &quot;that dreams that everything will be good at the end&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig's University in Freiburg.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In 1997 she graduated as a doctor of theology, also in Freiburg.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A post-doctoral lecturing qualification in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfalian Wilhelm's University.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has occupied a Chair for Systematic Theology in the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.</seg>

		<seg id="1">&quot;Marriage is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake,&quot; said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Tips, at least as to how the wedding celebration can be a success, have now been given at a special trade fair in the Domäne in Hechingen.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Important suppliers of all wedding-related products and services were represented.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A trend: The retro look is back once again.</seg>
		<seg id="5">This begins with the wedding clothing.</seg>
		<seg id="6">White is a must, best muted or in cream.</seg>
		<seg id="7">At the front, dresses with numerous ruffles and embroidery are in, often with a veil, while to the rear they run down the back and often end in a train.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However, opinions differ, as Stefanie Koch from the Modehaus Kleidermüller emphasised.</seg>
		<seg id="9">For men, suits with a waistcoat and neckerchief are most popular, although some people do choose cream or brown combinations.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Selecting the venue is important, it was explained.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Plain adjoining rooms are not ideal, the ambience should be special.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In this regard, the Domäne drew attention to their own facilities in the carriage house.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Uwe Link has an offer for anyone who wants to set off in a carriage.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;However, carriages are also popular for hen parties,&quot; he commented.</seg>
		<seg id="15">People were also on the lookout for romantic ideas for invitations, flower arrangements and wedding photographs.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The &quot;After-Wedding Photo&quot; is becoming increasingly fashionable - that is, series of pictures taken a few days after the celebration, at special locations, preferably in front of waterfalls or the like, but in full wedding clothing, explained Elisabeth Keidel.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Many other details for a successful wedding were presented in the Domäne on Sunday.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests with style.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The correct cosmetics and nail care mustn't be forgotten.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed a barrage of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Google is accused of infringing seven patents.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The patents cover technology that helps match Internet search terms with relevant advertising, the lawsuit said, which is the core of Google's search business.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not immediately be reached.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Samsung, Huawei and HTC all manufacture phones that operate on Google's Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In 2011 Google placed an initial $900 million bid for Nortel's patents.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Google increased its bid several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.</seg>
		<seg id="10">After losing out to Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google went on to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal driven partly by Motorola's library of patents.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Despite losing in its attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe,&quot; the lawsuit said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Rockstar is seeking increased damages against Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement is willful, according to the complaint.</seg>

		<seg id="3">According to the proposal, parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The throwaway society does not think</seg>
		<seg id="1">The night was long, the music loud and the atmosphere good, but at some point everyone has to go home.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Except: In the stomachs of those in the passenger and back seats, hunger strikes.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Of course, this may be down to the odd cocktail or glass of bubbly!</seg>
		<seg id="4">So what could be more natural than to casually pull into the next drive-through to pick yourself up a little treat?</seg>
		<seg id="5">I admit, I am right with you with it comes to picking up some fast food late at night, or early in the morning as the case may be.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A few chips, a coke, a burger - and then straight home and into bed!</seg>
		<seg id="7">However, on the way home the clear differences between me and other hungry clubbers become evident.</seg>
		<seg id="8">What is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window?!</seg>
		<seg id="9">At the weekend in particular, discarded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Why is this?&quot; I ask myself.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Are the people too stupid to take their bags home or throw them into the nearest rubbish bin?</seg>
		<seg id="12">After all, waste paper does more than spoil the landscape.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as crash barriers, thus causing accidents.</seg>
		<seg id="14">However, the so-called &quot;throwaway society&quot; does not think about such things. They probably do not even know what the term even means.</seg>
		<seg id="15">If you are often out and about in the evening, more often than not with several people in the car, you will know what a back seat can look like after having partied through the night: clothes, bottles and other rubbish begin to pile up.</seg>

		<seg id="0">A black box in your car?</seg>
		<seg id="1">As America's road planners struggle to find the cash to mend a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that fits neatly by the dashboard of your car.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The devices, which track every mile a motorist drives and transmit that information to bureaucrats, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for funding America's major roads.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The usually dull arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The tea party is aghast.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply concerned, too, raising a variety of privacy issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">And while Congress can't agree on whether to proceed, several states are not waiting.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers pay per mile of road they roll over.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS monitoring, for a test drive.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This really is a must for our nation.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not a matter of something we might choose to do,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every California motorist by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology is there to do it.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The push comes as the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars get many more miles to the gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't gone up in 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians are loath to raise the tax even one penny when gas prices are high.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;The gas tax is just not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">His state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay-by-mile system.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;This works out as the most logical alternative over the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is no surprise that the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the taxes could be rigged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gases, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">California planners are looking to the system as they devise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has said he, too, sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The free marketeers at the Reason Foundation are also fond of having drivers pay per mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not just a tax going into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People are paying more directly into what they are getting.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The movement is also bolstered by two former U.S. Transportation secretaries, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move in the pay-per-mile direction.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">But the House leadership killed the proposal, acting on concerns of rural lawmakers representing constituents whose daily lives often involve logging lots of miles to get to work or into town.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most eager is Oregon, which is enlisting 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Those drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of gas taxes to the state.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Nevada has already completed a pilot.</seg>
		<seg id="36">New York City is looking into one.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois is trying it on a limited basis with trucks.</seg>
		<seg id="38">And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they could go about implementing the change.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The concept is not a universal hit.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers' cars were equipped with the devices not long ago, drivers were uneasy about the government being able to monitor their every move.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;Concerns about Big Brother and those sorts of things were a major problem,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.</seg>
		<seg id="42">It was not something people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">As the trial got underway, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to build an enormous, unwieldy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals' everyday comings and goings.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is among several states now scrambling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven, but not exactly where and at what time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you can do that, Khan said, the public gets more comfortable.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The hunt for that technology has led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="49">It was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the devices it is testing appeal to highway planners because they don't use GPS and deliver a limited amount of information, uploaded periodically by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There are a lot less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose a device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they can choose not to have a device at all, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents.</seg>
		<seg id="57">Other places are hoping to sell the concept to a wary public by having the devices do more, not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees, provide &quot;pay-as-you-drive&quot; insurance, and create a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;Motorists would be attracted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them,&quot; says a city planning document.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some transportation planners, though, wonder if all the talk about paying by the mile is just a giant distraction.</seg>
		<seg id="61">At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply deal with the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="62">An extra one-time or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrids and others whose vehicles don't use much gas, so they pay their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;There is no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The official inaugural ceremony for the astro-turf sports field did not wane in significance for the town and the football club, in spite of the cold weather and rain.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the ceremony last Saturday, however the weather gods chose not to cooperate.</seg>
		<seg id="3">So anyone who came without an umbrella, or for whatever reason could not hold onto one, drew the short straw.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This was the case for the musicians who accompanied the ceremony, as well as for a number of speakers.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Thus, FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfilment of a dream, also got fairly wet.</seg>
		<seg id="6">His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was heavily involved in the realisation of the project, the Town Council, the companies involved and club members who played a part.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Particular mention went out to Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The spry pensioners laid 400 square metres of flagging for the new paths.</seg>
		<seg id="9">This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by Member of the State Parliament, Karl Rombach.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Further words of greeting were issued to the town Sports Commissioner, Hubert Baier, the District Chairperson of the Southern Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth division.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Mayor Klumpp recalled that weather-related influences in the Spring and Autumn had repeatedly afflicted the original sports field, to such an extent that it could not be played on.</seg>
		<seg id="12">It was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered, when the construction of a third pitch on the football club site or at the secondary school on Salinensee Lake were considered.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Both ideas were rejected.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Six years ago, thoughts turned to laying an astro-turf pitch, which was generally viewed as the perfect solution.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Specific plans were drawn up two years ago, when the FC inherited the Schabelstube in leasehold, promised a contribution of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the pitch and the state approved a subsidy of EUR 104,000.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In October 2012, the Town Council decided to cover the remaining EUR 356,000 of the total cost of EUR 560,000, summarised Klumpp.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Work began on the 68 x 108 metre astro-turf pitch on 4 June.</seg>
		<seg id="18">During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, of which half was used for the laying of a dirt bike track.</seg>

		<seg id="5">In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The charges filed by the US justice department include espionage and theft of government property.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hans-Peter Friedrich, German interior minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain following claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela's Merkel's phone.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees intelligence, said that if there were an opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without bringing him into danger and completely ruining relations with the US,&quot; it should be taken.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Ströbele, an MP for Germany's Green party, published a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter feed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Mr Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA contractor's lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left.</seg>
		<seg id="13">If Mr Snowden testified in Germany he would need assurances that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, the MP said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a &quot;severe and sustained&quot; campaign of persecution that forced him from his home.</seg>
		<seg id="15">However he said that he was heartened by the worldwide response to &quot;my act of political expression.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="16">Citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the United States - have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The letter extends an offer to cooperate with German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Mozambique security concerns mount as powerful personalities clash</seg>
		<seg id="1">With a statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, staring down on them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace slogans in a rare public demonstration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;We want peace back; we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Fearful about the future of her country, she swapped her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;we demand security&quot; in Portuguese as she joined the crowds in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="4">For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst skirmishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.</seg>
		<seg id="6">After a 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have unnerved foreign investors and locals.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in more than $50bn of investment over the next few next years from companies including Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Renamo says the government initiated the latest clashes by launching an attack on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Renamo stronghold, on October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Assaults on the former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo for triggering the clashes, accusing it of attacking soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza has sought to play down concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Mr Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But concerns have grown after Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told the FT that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by Frelimo.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but with seriousness,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.</seg>
		<seg id="20">&quot;It's two big men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads together,&quot; said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of concessions that are necessary.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Renamo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott municipal elections due in November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Presidential and parliamentary polls are scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to win concessions and financial spoils from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Renamo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was formed by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its showing at the elections.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear how much capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the skirmishes have taken place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but hosts Beira, the port that miners, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mr Mazanga was coy when asked about whether Renamo would repeat this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The instability has added to frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his final years in the &quot;Freihof&quot; were brought to life.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The large audience was inspired by the extremely amusing role play.</seg>
		<seg id="3">From his arrival, to his being conferred with honorary citizenship and his death, Alois Kraftzcyk, the scriptwriter and actor portraying Hansjakob, has written an entertaining play, which received great acclaim under the directorship of Cornelia Volk.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Marcus Zagermann, serving as narrator, guided the audience through the ten different scenes, explained circumstances and provided links explaining leaps from his youth to the time when he was approaching retirement.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On 22 October 1913, Hansjakob returned home to his childhood paradise, to his Freihof.</seg>
		<seg id="6">It was there that the role-play began, with Alois Krafczyk shining once again in his famous role as the town's great son.</seg>
		<seg id="7">True to style, he travelled with a two-horse carriage drawn by &quot;Schwarzwälder Füchsen&quot; (Black Forest Chestnut Horses) owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Not only was he received with great applause from the audience, but was also welcomed by his sister Philippine.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Billy Sum-Hermann managed unbelievably well to place herself in the role of the sister and brought the character to life amazingly well, in terms of both her expressions and gestures.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected musical pieces, thus rounding off the performance.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The honour of presenting the title of honorary citizen went to Haslach's Mayor, Heinz Winkler, who, together with a section of the Town Council, made an appearance representing the Mayor of Hüttich from back in Hansjakob's day.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The &quot;Dreikönig&quot; singers then made their own appearance, leading Hansjakob to exclaim: &quot;Oh how beautiful, this brings childhood memories of my own time in a Dreikönig group back to life&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="13">With their song, &quot;O Jesulein&quot;, they delighted the audience in the Freihof, as did the &quot;Storchentagskinder&quot; with their loud cries of &quot;Heraus, Heraus&quot; .</seg>
		<seg id="14">In his day, Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the institutional church, as well as his concerns regarding the excesses in the rural economy, the consequences of industrialisation and the effects of the war.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He found his place of rest on his native soil, behind his mausoleum on the Brand  near Hofstetten.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The role-play ended with the words &quot;A restless spirit finally found rest and returned home forever&quot;.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The performance received great applause and many words of praise from the audience.</seg>

		<seg id="1">A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter accused of defamation is to be overhauled, a press regulator says.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The Guangzhou-based New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.</seg>
		<seg id="3">But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes to fabricate stories about a part state-owned company.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Now the New Express is to undergo &quot;full rectification,&quot; the regulator said.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The &quot;rectification&quot; order came from the Guangdong Administration of Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published several untrue reports about listed company Zoomlion in the period of September 2012 to August 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;New Express's editorial management was disordered,&quot; the regulator said in a statement.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It said it had decided to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by revoking his reporter's license.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="9">It had also &quot;instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete rectification of New Express, and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at New Express and immediately revise New Express's leadership team.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.</seg>
		<seg id="11">After he was detained, his newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release, saying it backed his journalism.</seg>
		<seg id="12">But Mr Chen then appeared on state television admitting he had published false stories for money.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;In this case I've caused damages to Zoomlion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public's trust,&quot; he told state broadcaster CCTV.</seg>
		<seg id="14">I did this mainly because I hankered after money and fame.</seg>
		<seg id="15">I've realised my wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly check his reports.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Several high-profile suspects have made televised confessions recently.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that it was a glitch that brought down its public website for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.</seg>
		<seg id="2">&quot;NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The issue will be resolved this evening.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are not true.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Earlier this evening online server trackers noted the NSA's website had been down for at least six hours, and the site continues to be inaccessible for some users.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Earlier an NSA spokesperson told ABC News the agency's internal, sensitive network was &quot;not at all&quot; compromised.</seg>
		<seg id="7">No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At least one hacktivist group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.</seg>
		<seg id="9">DDoS attacks are designed to flood a target website with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The cyber tactic is a relatively unsophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to penetrate the internal network of the target system.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The formerly super secretive NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has found itself in very public light, and amid vicious criticism, in past months following a stream of revelations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collectively the product of secret NSA files stolen from the agency and leaked by disenchanted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Such growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted early speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.</seg>

		<seg id="5">During the course of the day one thing became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new system is reluctantly yet visibly giving way to confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-time members of the pastoral care team addressed topics ranging from perceptions and expectations regarding the 2015 reforms, to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the Parish Council.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drawn-up guidelines for pastoral care units in the arch-diocese of Freiburg with the help of  a presentation.</seg>
		<seg id="8">According to the guidelines, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will be a corporation under public law, which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">There will then only be one joint Parish Council and a Foundation Council, in which the rector will be represented by virtue of his office.</seg>
		<seg id="10">From each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, with so-called church community teams set up on-site in the six parishes.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Regarding the issue of the finances of the individual parishes, the need for extensive discussion became evident.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The reforms plan for the accumulated assets in the parishes to be retained for a specified purpose.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Accounts payable, on the other hand, will be passed over to the &quot;church community&quot; as a whole.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In particular, planned major investments, the debts from which thus affect all parishes, were cause for great concern.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;In the past, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes by themselves,&quot; said Haslach's Parish Council Chairman Bruno Prinzbach.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Barbar Ritter, Chair of the Committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, has practical experience of a joint committee for five parishes.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In 2006 she set herself the task, &quot;Become one, remain five&quot; and came to realise that the task is really not that simple.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The Committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint Parish Council, and the practical work of the church community teams.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring.</seg>
		<seg id="21">At the end, Parish Counsellor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was agreed on by a clear majority.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The Treasury have provisionally costed out the CGT measure but are awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 Budget, introduced a 7% rate of stamp duty for homes costing more than £2m and annual charges for buyers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Already the stamp duty take for residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the combined total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber put together.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Mr Cook said: &quot;Following increases in stamp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed irrespective of the effect of the out-dated council tax system.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;But this move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell,&quot; he added.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the affluent south-west London belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prices in central London continued to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a burgeoning &quot;domestic market&quot; with the city's south west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) all experiencing an uptick, according to research from Savills.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Report: Obama campaign considered dumping Biden for Hillary Clinton</seg>
		<seg id="1">President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, according to the New York Times.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The revelation is the most notable bombshell from Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome, &quot;Double Down: Game Change 2012.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the President's top aides conducted &quot;extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011&quot; to gauge whether the dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to the Times' national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice President would have in the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;Double Down&quot; claims Daley spearheaded the effort to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal rapport,&quot; before ultimately deciding against the move when their data showed adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't &quot;materially improve Obama's odds.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replacing Biden with Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I was vocal about looking into a whole bunch of things, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the paper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">You have to remember, at that point the President was in awful shape, so we were like, &quot;Holy Christ, what do we do?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">While Daley characterized the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something,&quot; Martin said on AC360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the swap.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">While Daley said he doesn't think the President &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's &quot;possible&quot; Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know about the research into dumping Biden from the ticket.</seg>
		<seg id="18">&quot;Possibly,&quot; Martin replied.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Town Council delighted with solid budget</seg>
		<seg id="1">Every time discussion in Town Council meetings turns to the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has good reason to smile.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The municipality coffers in Herdwangen-Schönach are well stocked and the administration has been debt-free since 2005.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In this sense, this the 2012 budgetary year, can also be recorded as a complete success.</seg>
		<seg id="4">This became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="5">As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget came in at more than EUR one million higher than originally planned, at around 7.6 million Euro.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The administrative budget surplus, at around EUR 1.8 million, also stood at around EUR one million above projections.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The surplus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities' contribution towards income tax.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The capital budget also stood well above the projected values.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Instead of the projected EUR 1.5 million Euro, the value for last year was EUR 2.5 million.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;This is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget,&quot; said Rothmund.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned, the reserves also came in higher.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In total, they managed to increase the general contingency reserves by around EUR 2.1 million, to a total of EUR 4.9 million.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and its team for the good work.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;A job like this is not something you achieve overnight,&quot; said Gerster in praise of the annual financial statement.</seg>
		<seg id="15">He and the Town Councillors are clearly delighted with the good figures.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It may sound like a paradox, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="17">In the past, a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municipal rates.</seg>
		<seg id="18">However, according to Gerster, from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state.</seg>
		<seg id="19">There are prerequisites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Among other requirements, the towns and municipalities applying for the subsidies must levy certain municipal rates.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;We have to address the subject of municipal rates, as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies,&quot; commented Gerster regarding this matter.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope in possibility of change</seg>
		<seg id="2">He says Obama has had worthy efforts thwarted by GOP obstructionism</seg>
		<seg id="3">Obstructionism can't excuse Obamacare website woes, drone attacks</seg>
		<seg id="4">Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what might have been</seg>
		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">It's a book that I thought would uplift me during the doldrums of second-year medical school, and renew in me a sense of hope.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It's called &quot;The Audacity to Win,&quot; and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">When I'm finished with my patient write-ups at night and get into bed, the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election turned out to be a landslide, and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic nature of the hour.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates cried with joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">A young team of visionaries was headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During Obama's transition to office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.</seg>
		<seg id="14">And then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Cutting to the present is a rude awakening, like snapping out of a dream.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It's hard to remember those days of optimism -- they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of opportunities gone by.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Change indeed happened, in the years since I cast my first ballot.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was simply nothing I could have imagined.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I credit Obama with great and varied accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to our military exit from Iraq, the end of &quot;don't ask don't tell,&quot; to the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has upended too many efforts to push our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health care, and closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But, after the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration to colleagues and peers, I've reached a limit to the explanations that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I've reached a point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing the bugging of foreign leaders, nor having drones strike innocent children overseas.</seg>
		<seg id="24">It cannot explain having the National Security Agency collect data on the private lives of Americans, nor prosecuting whistle-blowers who reveal government wrongdoing.</seg>
		<seg id="25">It cannot account for assassinating Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor shirking public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">It cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are the &quot;most aggressive ... since the Nixon Administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And, most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know if this is what I should have expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">If, at 18 years old, I was supposed to figure out that governance may contradict the political campaigns that precede it.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Obviously, elective office isn't a predictable course, as the opposing political party and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public conversation.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet, of all of the examples that I have listed above, they largely seem to be of the administration's own choosing.</seg>
		<seg id="32">That is what troubles me most of all.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited by his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard of for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Still, as Obama's approval rating sank below 45% this week, returning to 2008 through that book has become that much harder.</seg>
		<seg id="37">It makes me yearn for the many promises that disappeared.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I was reading the portion of the book describing how Obama suffered a huge loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want us to get our mojo back,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">We've got to remember who we are.'</seg>
		<seg id="42">It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.</seg>
