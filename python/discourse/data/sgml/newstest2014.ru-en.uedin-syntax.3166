		<seg id="1">Survivors and relatives 202 dead as a result of the bomb blast in Bali in 2002 angrily reacted to the last sentence of the conspirators, who appeared before the court, and claimed that Umar Patek should be shot.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run, as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in creating explosive devices used in the attack.</seg>
		<seg id="3">If he can be released within 15 years, will receive parole.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The 45-year-old defendant was convicted in the massacre as a result of an attack on two night club in the popular tourist district Kuta, during which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism related charges, including in a wave of bombings of churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Prosecutors demanded life imprisonment, although they would insist that the man nicknamed &quot;podryvnikom&quot; for his reputation of the wizard for making explosives, should be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This decision has painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortines, which lost its 39letnih dochereybliznetov Jane and Jenny in the attacks, effected Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Barely while stifling tears, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.</seg>
		<seg id="10">He should be judged before astral team,&quot; said Ms. Courtin AAP.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;I will not have to live every day knowing that I have more grandchildren and I don't see my daughters.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;Sari&quot; club was destroyed, when massive explosive device was put in motion, implicit in a van parked outside, just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Peter Hughes was &quot;Paddy&quot; in a bar, where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack, with explosives, just 20 seconds before.</seg>
		<seg id="14">After that attack for a month he went into a coma and &quot;died&quot; three times, being connected to a life-support system.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah, responsible for the bloody massacre,&quot; Samudra Amrozi Mukhlas and Imam, who were executed four years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.</seg>
		<seg id="17">To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Get 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundreds - it is not so much.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Patek is the last of the terrorist attack in Bali, tried in court.</seg>
		<seg id="20">He was hiding for nearly 10 years, but in the end was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former al-Qaida ringleader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.</seg>
		<seg id="21">In the course of the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence data showed: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda terrorist groups.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;He didn't give up,&quot; said Ms. Courtin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Until recently he never regretted how much grief he caused to other people.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The sentence imposed on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist act, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.</seg>
		<seg id="25">&quot;this year will be a lot of tears,&quot; said Ms. Courtin.</seg>

		<seg id="0">The producers of jet aircraft bind over seat width, when large orders is at stake</seg>
		<seg id="1">Among the leading aircraft manufacturers inflamed fierce debate about the width of seats tourist class on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation on Dubai aviation exhibition in this month.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The dispute moves around the width of seats, provided the economy class passengers on long-haul flights, whose interests are not always in the spotlight airlines, with the volume of space allocated to them plays a key role in statements about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft, Airbus SAS offered and Boeing Co.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Airbus this week called for the introduction of the industry standard, which included the seats at least 18 inches wide (46 cm) in salons economy, but its main American rival Boeing says it must deal with the airline.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in all sales of larger versions of its bimotor long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 expected potentially record orders.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The rear of the plane - especially the arrangement, whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - occupies a central place in the statements about the economic efficiency of new projects &quot;miniaerobusov.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">Boeing says its new 777 will accommodate 406 people, on the basis of seats in Economy Class of more than 17 inches in width placed to 10 in each row.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Airbus says that competing version of its 350 will be transported in online 350 people on seats 18 inches wide, located on nine in a row.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Aircraft manufacturing giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.</seg>
		<seg id="9">But now Airbus appeals directly to the public before airshow in Dubai, where the 777, is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.</seg>
		<seg id="10">She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war, showing a slide depicting three people in a restaurant financiers, pressed to each other, called &quot;you would agree to this?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;Boeing is offering long-haul flights on seats narrower than the regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">With the change in the diet, people are gaining weight, but aircraft equipment seat has not changed.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Between the beginning of the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 shirocofuselagny asked the standards of modern long-distance travel, and international century the average weight of American men aged 40 to 49 years has increased by 10 percent, according to the Department of Health of the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The average American male waist girth of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the health service in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those who recently called &quot;reactive audience,&quot; was already.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Airbus says that commissioned the study, testifying that extra inch in width seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Boeing disputes Airbus figures on the size of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere in decisions about how airlines to find a balance between tariffs and amenities.</seg>
		<seg id="18">According to her, studies show that interior convenience depends not only on seat width.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;all really comes down to providing airlines choices and opportunities to do that, in their view, they have to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing specialist on Kent Craver saloon.</seg>
		<seg id="20">They don't want us to decide for them, that they would bring a profit.</seg>
		<seg id="21">They know their business better than anyone else.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The issue is to increase space for passengers on the sides, but for suppliers, it is increasingly becoming a factor, which can affect profits.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes, at least in the $700 billion for catalogs prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of US and European exports.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As Reuters agency reported in July for the first time, the location of seats is precisely what fuels rivalries in the battle between the latest state aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Both Airbus and Boeing say about 20percent increasing profitability at one place in their latest bimotor long-haul models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365mestnsm Boeing both.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Announced the characteristics of Boeing 777 are partly based on a comparison of 10set rows with the original 9mestnoy layout of 777 constructive solutions.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The win in the share price declines when compared with 10set layout used in real time.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;the reason that Boeing is doing this is to squeeze more seats and make your plane more competitive compared with our developments,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of the department of passenger comfort Airbus in Europe.</seg>

		<seg id="6">After the 1992 truce, it has become an opposition party.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again ECB to full-scale conflict, but recent events made me nervous foreign investors and local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore reserves of natural gas and coal deposits in the northwest may attract more than $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the US.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The ruling party Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and the party Renamo accuse each other of this tension.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The party Renamo argues that the government has become the latest clashes challenger, attacking its members in the province of other diseases, traditional an Renamo, on October 17.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The attack on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama - the leader of the group, told the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, Renamo representative.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The government blames Renamo in initiating clashes, accusing the party in an attack on soldiers.</seg>
		<seg id="13">President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Guebuza AFP, the French news agency, said on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt &quot;a failure,&quot; zahotevshim to use &quot;all that is left of his forces, to try to prove that he can impose their own government decisions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.</seg>

		<seg id="22">Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections, scheduled for November.</seg>
		<seg id="23">The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Some commentators interpreted this pressure slabs movement as an attempt to win concessions and financial bonuses from the government.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The share of votes for Renamo declines since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique, or MDM, which is a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who has to step down in the next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;He does not want to multiparty democracy, he does not want to transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the presidency,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="28">It is unclear what possibilities Renamo, but she has already made rapid and devastating attacks on police stations and cars on a key motorway leading from the north to the south.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Most of the clashes took place in the province of other diseases, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Bear - port, which mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale, used to export coal.</seg>
		<seg id="30">In June, Rio has suspended the use of tracks roughly a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railway.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Mazanga was noncommittal when he asked the question of whether Renamo ends this threat.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The party Renamo wanted &quot;to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not very good,&quot; said Mazanga.</seg>
		<seg id="33">Instability intensified discontent with the government, but many people also care about corruption, the slow pace of development and more recently, kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media companies Mediacoop.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;People think that the government and the president, which bear the responsibility for the country's future and must find a solution to these problems,&quot; he says.</seg>

		<seg id="36">&quot;no one cares neither Renamo nor Frelimo, they just want to resume the peace, they want free access to roads,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Scientists shed light on how the movement of the tail of the dog is related to her mood.</seg>
		<seg id="1">Earlier studies have shown that pleased with dogs vilyat3 tail in the right side, from the point of view of the dog, while alarmed dogs pomahivat3 tail mainly in the left side.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But now scientists say that other members of the canid family may notice these subtle differences in willing tail and respond to them.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist from Trent University, said: &quot;It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently are involved in shaping stimulators that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="4">We tried to look at this and that of other species.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He added that the same way in humans, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body, and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="6">To learn more about how dogs react to sophisticated piling tails other dogs, the researchers watched the animals when they watched films about other dogs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">They measured the frequency of heart animals and analyzed their behavior.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Perhaps soon we understand why their tails sometimes are sent to one side, and sometimes - to another</seg>
		<seg id="9">Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown the video with dogs - dogs or naturalistic version, or silhouette, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">When the animals have seen that in other respects nothing conveyed the dog was the tail to the right, from the point of view of the tail of the dog wiles), they remained completely relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But when they noticed that the tail tended mostly left (again from the point of view of the tail of the dog wiles), their heartbeat ucate and they looked alarmed.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Professor Vallortigara said he doesn't think that dogs is deliberately communicated with each other with the help of these movements.</seg>
		<seg id="13">In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, about what movements they should worry about, and what is not.</seg>
		<seg id="14">He notes: &quot;If there is a few meetings with other dogs and often vile their tail in one direction is associated with a more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on that experience.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="15">The researchers say that these results may give owners, veterinarians and dressers a deeper understanding of their animal emotions.</seg>
		<seg id="16">An expert in the field of the behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, invited researcher in Bristol University veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to test of whether the value for dogs have left and right hand.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Last year a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln's discovered that dogs turn your head to the left, to look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if look at devil dog.</seg>
		<seg id="18">And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada he reported: &quot;dogs often approached sobacerobotu, when its tail vile program to the left, and not to the right, instead become alarmed, is the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian study.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="0">Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?</seg>
		<seg id="1">The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather representatives of business and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs in the UK want to see in the relationship with the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="2">To this end we have ordered the largest and most complete a survey of British leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The company YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 of business leaders, representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sector and region.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The findings of the survey will surprise to many.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We found out that the vast majority of companies are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, with particular attention to countries that hold the modernization and grow, while the EU countries to stagnate.</seg>
		<seg id="6">They want the government has given priority new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spent time on a long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions confusing.</seg>
		<seg id="7">When they were asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to laws on products, the majority of business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned Westminster.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Attended the general discontent of the single market, with business representatives have stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits from being in Europe's trade zone,&quot; agreed with this even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European configured from all companies.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The last and most revealing - our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants the United Kingdom has pursued a course for a change of the treaty and on relations with the EU based on trade, not politics.</seg>
		<seg id="10">This result, which was observed among enterprises of all sizes and the largest (MFA), shows that business insists on a &quot;significant change&quot; that will return the powers back to the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The stakes are high - the achievement of changes in the treaty and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide 16percent shift in voting for it to stay in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The prime minister there should be no doubt: This poll shows that British business supports his plan renegotiation of Britain's membership in the EU.</seg>
		<seg id="13">It also shows that the business expects that the revision will result in a significant shift in the current balance of power back toward the UK.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The best conditions possible for British business and become all the more necessary as the eurozone is on a path toward closer economic and fiscal union.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Priority should get jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means the increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in regulatory activity of Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="2">As a rule, it was either about their rebuilding and expanding highways, or about trying to reduce demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Widely known example of Singapore, where introduced strict quota increase the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them will be bought at auction.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Its price is two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.</seg>
		<seg id="5">European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the center of the city.</seg>
		<seg id="6">In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introducing the so-called green zone, where entry is allowed only cars with certain eclass that use the fuel of high quality (including biofuels or electric cars).</seg>
		<seg id="7">Beijing's environmental protection agency, for example, approved in 2012 &quot;clean air five-year plan&quot; worth about 250 billion yuan (around $40 billion).</seg>
		<seg id="8">As director of the traffic pollution control department told Kommersant municipal environmental protection bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the Plan - the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the growth in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase in no more than 5% of the use of fuel per one vehicle.</seg>
		<seg id="9">According to the agency, motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% overall air pollution.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Among the main measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport, as well as the imposition of additional taxes for car owners.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Among other things, the city's &quot;Green Plan&quot; measures include accelerated transition to corporate fuel compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of the local system standards and marking cars and fuel, restricting entry of cars in the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (, moreover, the creation of a financial incentive programs to replace old vehicles to hybrid or electric cars, the development of the electric (including public and official), development of public transport, including high-speed).</seg>

		<seg id="1">Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon</seg>
		<seg id="2">Belle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients</seg>
		<seg id="3">In this West African country doctors not so much - just one in 5,000 people</seg>
		<seg id="4">Vote here or through your mobile device</seg>
		<seg id="5">Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes CNN 2013.</seg>
		<seg id="6">You can vote for him, or for any of the other 10 of the main characters, to become CNN Hero of the Year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">This person will receive $250,000 to continue its remarkable work.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Over the past 21 years Georges Bwelle saw his father returned to life and would once again in an unconscious state, wandering for hospitals, which were not properly equipped to help him.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Jammeh Belle was injured in a car crash in 1981, not far from Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</seg>
		<seg id="10">At first he had just broken hand, but the infection has spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded about himself to the end of his life.</seg>
		<seg id="11">There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, said Georges Bwelle.</seg>
		<seg id="12">If we had the money, we would have taken him from Cameroon.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Instead, Belle years accompanied his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment that they could get.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;It's not easy,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;You can go out of the house at 5 a.m., pribate in hospital, to be the first, but you are not the first.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Patients are very much.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Some may die due to the fact that they have to wait.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The situation is not much has changed since then, as Belle's father died in 2002.</seg>
		<seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor for 5,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="20">By comparison, the ratio is one doctor for 413 people in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="21">And even if Cameron could go to the doctor, many of them it would be unaffordable.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of spending on health care in it are private.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;their only problem is poverty,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy your life.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="25">Seeing the suffering of his father and a great many of his compatriots, Belle became determined to do something with this.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers spent 700 free operations.</seg>
		<seg id="27">He himself has become a doctor and vascular surgeon works in Yaounde Central Hospital.</seg>
		<seg id="28">He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Since 2008 he and his band of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Almost every Friday he and up to 30 more people nabius in vans, privyazyvaty3 to roofs medical supplies and travel cross-country to visit villages in need of help.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Not always accompanies them luck.</seg>
		<seg id="32">More than once they had to push the car through the river and mud.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But when they come, they face, as the real heroes: This holiday with songs and dances and the best facilities, which can only offer local residents.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Free medical care in these villages really is a cause for celebration, and Belle with his broad smile and boundless energy more than happy to join fun.</seg>
		<seg id="35">The next morning, the brigade is beginning to take hundreds of patients.</seg>
		<seg id="36">&quot;We accept 500 people on each trip,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">They come from all over the landscape within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Many people are receiving treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted infections.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Others may get scratches, donated points or free birth certificates - the documents necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.</seg>
		<seg id="41">In the evening, the brigade has a simple operation under local anesthesia.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The operation, as a rule, are held in the school building, the municipality or in the house; after the procedure patients stand up and go to the post-operative zone, to make room for the next person.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary processing equipment, Belle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.</seg>
		<seg id="44">This is unsustainable pace, but determination brigade usually help maintain village musicians.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;They all night beat the drums, so we were awake and continued to work,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="46">On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of his work.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The group, consisting of doctors and foreign Cameron for medical students, spent 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their assistance could have huge implications for those they help.</seg>
		<seg id="48">One man explained that they received free surgery for hernia treatment will allow him to work again.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;It will change the future for me and my family,&quot; said the man.</seg>
		<seg id="50">In addition to this clinical methods on weekends and working in a hospital surgeon Belle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.</seg>
		<seg id="51">It is this second work, he said, provides 60 percent of funding his nonprofit organizations; the remaining funds covered by private donations.</seg>
		<seg id="52">&quot;I don't even know when he sleeps,&quot; said Kathy On 'Melli, a student of the second course Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in the Belle group.</seg>
		<seg id="53">He has always either in the hospital or trying to earn money for the organization, so that you can continue to these campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="54">For the future of doctors and nurses, such as On 'Melli, coming from the United States and Europe, to join Belle in the implementation of its tasks is to practice, they would never have received at home.</seg>
		<seg id="55">&quot;We got to these individuals on operations, where we helped to remove blood stains or keep Belle tools for doctors,&quot; said On 'Melli.</seg>
		<seg id="56">As studentomvtorocursnikom, you would never have received such a possibility in America.</seg>
		<seg id="57">American usually pay their fare themselves in Cameroon, often arriving with pogertvovanmi medication.</seg>
		<seg id="58">But on arrival in Yaounde them food, transport and education pays Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;On 'Melli hero, without a doubt,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="60">He gives his life of this organization, and his desire to help people Cameroon indefinitely.</seg>
		<seg id="61">For Belle almost constant work load is not a severe test.</seg>
		<seg id="62">To help others to live a happy life, his father to fulfill this promise is what brings him great joy.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;I am so happy when doing this work,&quot; said Belle.</seg>
		<seg id="64">&quot;And I think about my father.</seg>
		<seg id="65">I hope he sees what I do.</seg>

		<seg id="1">This week the black list of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in America has been updated with new names and four companies.</seg>
		<seg id="2">The US Treasury has put in a &quot;brotherly circle&quot; three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israelis.</seg>
		<seg id="3">One of the Russians turned out to be a famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the United States suspect in transportation money for the members of the group.</seg>
		<seg id="4">In all the US black list of 22 people implicated in the &quot;brotherly circle,&quot; and six organizations affiliated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Yet many experts expressed doubt that this organization is really there.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;statement about the 'fraternal circle' more resembles the attempt to unite disparate criminal groups,&quot; said previously organized crime expert and professor at the University of New York's Mark galeotti.</seg>
		<seg id="7">In his opinion, &quot;brotherly circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">&quot;I haven't met anyone in Russian law enforcement bodies or elsewhere, who would have confirmed the existence of such criminal organizations,&quot; quotes Mr. galeotti American Center for Research of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="9">With Mr. galeotti agree and a professor at George Mason University Liz Shelley.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;If they work together, then it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization,&quot; - leads her words Center for Research of corruption and organized crime.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In the middle of last year, Mark galeotti suggested that &quot;brotherly circle&quot; unites in large measure close Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hassan.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Criminal authority was killed in January of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="13">So, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashov, extended the list in 2012, has been closely linked with Dad Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, accounted for Santa Hasan nephew.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Yet Mr. galeotti notes that some personality and have no relationship to Usoyan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">In his opinion, all of them spent more general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Meanwhile the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the &quot;brotherly circle&quot; Grigori Leps - Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer - has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Of course, we hope that we will get more detailed information from our American collegpartnerov, in connection with what the decision was made, why it in such lists made, said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the head of state.</seg>
		<seg id="18">In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.</seg>
		<seg id="2">It is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and major layoffs.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Our main concern now is not that growth slowed, but rather, the structure of this growth.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The last time he completely driven by consumption, which almost does not ease up speed,&quot; said chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens only, presenting a quarterly report of Investbank yesterday on the Russian economy.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Now nominal wage growth in Russia - about 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="6">With inflation at 6% he can ensure future consumer demand around the current level, expect at Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="7">But the profitability of Russian companies falls, however, most likely, they will optimize staff costs.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Today we see significant growth of the share of wages in GDP: If wages are rising by 10%, that is only 2% of GDP, explained Mr. only.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Companies faced with declining profitability.</seg>
		<seg id="10">If she didn't grow up, this could lead to dismissals and a rise in unemployment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Not to raise the salaries of Russian business cannot, said Vladimir Pantyushin chief economist at Barclays Capital in Russia and the CIS.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Unemployment near historic lows, competition for workers is high.</seg>
		<seg id="13">To attract employees from the side or keep current, employers have to raise wages.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Consumption in Russia poder of give and very rapid growth potrebcreditovania.</seg>
		<seg id="15">According to Mr. only because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans multiplicative effect on the economy of the country does not have this kind of lending.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;good for the economy from potrebcreditovania growth, we have not seen any money not diverge on the economy, and return to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; the economist said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But the problem in the other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on unsecured credit.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Take them in the impoverished people who have nothing to offer in the provision.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Interest on such loans are high.</seg>
		<seg id="20">As a result, they often do not return,&quot; said Mr. only.</seg>
		<seg id="21">However the second threat to economic growth in Russia - a possible crisis of non-payments on unsecured credit.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Director of HSE banking institution Vasily Solodkov now sees signs of growing banking crisis.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Small credit organizations, not having access to cheap resources, which have banks, were forced to raise funds for the population at a high interest rate.</seg>
		<seg id="24">In response banks took to the trail of war and began to cut lending rates,&quot; the economist continued.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest, otherwise they will be negative interest margin.</seg>
		<seg id="26">If banks does not waive dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, said Vasily Solodkov.</seg>
		<seg id="27">A holder of the licenses of some banks in recent weeks, an economist says harbinger of mass collapse.</seg>
		<seg id="28">&quot;banks themselves don't cope with such a situation: A system of deposit insurance was not originally designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; warned the head of the Institute.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But consumption growth will slow and without the crisis of non-payments, believe in prestigious, civil servants and the military - because of the refusal of wage indexation, inherent in the current version of the draft budget.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Partly hit consumption will be softened freeze tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, the decline in inflation).</seg>
		<seg id="31">But only partly: If investments don't rise (as preconditions to that as long as there is no - see a certificate), consumption growth will slow, sure of Goldman Sachs.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital until it sees the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.</seg>
		<seg id="33">&quot;The main risk is still falling oil prices,&quot; he says.</seg>
		<seg id="34">In his estimation, Russia's economy will shrink at the price of oil below $90/bbl.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is still unable to lower interest rates in the economy.</seg>
		<seg id="36">There is a paradoxical picture: Inflation has fallen, and banks began to raise the stakes.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This may mean that they do not believe the Central Bank, even the transition to targeting inflation,&quot; said Clemens only.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The Central Bank policy interest rates does not affect the market, affects only on interbank lending rates.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;it's the collapse of all hopes for the Central Bank,&quot; Clemens appreciated only one person.</seg>
		<seg id="40">The money generated by auctions of the Central Bank, banks are not lending to the economy and to manage their liquidity</seg>
		<seg id="41">As soon as the rate decreases, immediately changing the exchange rate, this means that the funds are trying to leave on speculation against the ruble.</seg>
		<seg id="42">&quot;sooner or later the Central Bank realize that this strategy is not working,&quot; said Mr. only and recalled that the state take the ruble in &quot;floating&quot; plans by the end of 2015.</seg>
		<seg id="43">But will have to either do it before, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.</seg>
		<seg id="44">In his estimation, the ruble exchange rate now artificially overvalued by 10%.</seg>
		<seg id="45">The ruble only one road is weakening,&quot; concludes the expert.</seg>
		<seg id="46">But if the Central Bank seront finalists a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to a weakening of the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much stronger.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices during the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on a cell phone,&quot; according to the new guidelines, published on Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration.</seg>
		<seg id="2">But passengers should not expect that the changes would happen immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="3">How quickly such a change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Airlines will have to show the FAA, as their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update its manuals for flight crew members and the rules for the installation of devices, to comply with the new guidelines.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Fau said that it has already received from some airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Delta and JetBlue were among airlines, which have already submitted plans.</seg>
		<seg id="7">&quot;depending on the state of the plan we could approve expanding the use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; said FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="8">At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as the plane door is closed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">They should not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet elevation and the captain does not provide &quot;good.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="10">Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for planting, and do not include them until the plane is on the ground.</seg>
		<seg id="11">In accordance with the new guidelines, the airlines whose planes properly protected from electronic interference, may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and steering, FAA said.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Most of the new jetliners and other planes, modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, is expected to meet these criteria.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional cabin, welcomed the changes.</seg>
		<seg id="14">&quot;after the new policy will be implemented safely (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier, to achieve this), it will be a win-win scenario,&quot; said Glading.</seg>
		<seg id="15">We frankly tired feel &quot;dejure at school,&quot; when it comes to this issue.</seg>
		<seg id="16">But the connection to the Internet for surfing, email exchange of letters, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, according to the agency.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Thus, still no &quot;Words with friends&quot; - intellectual gaming, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played on your smartphone in 2011, when the sensational case occurred: The actor was removed from the plane, the airline's American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="19">A heavier devices, such as laptops, still need to be laid in the luggage department, because they can injure someone if will fly around the cabin.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be banned.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Regulatory authority on phone calls are owned by the Federal Communications Commission, not FAA.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Fau may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing</seg>
		<seg id="23">Last month the National Council for Transport Safety, a national security expert Mark Rosenker transportation of CBS News, said that cell phones are still risk.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;cell phones - it really is the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FCC Rules that they can interfere with cell phone towers, when the plane is in the air,&quot; said Rosenker.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Industry advisory committee, the FAA to consider the matter, recommended last month that the government has allowed more widespread use of personal electronic devices.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In recent years growing pressure on FAA with the aim of easing restrictions on their use.</seg>
		<seg id="27">Critics, such as October from Missouri Claire McCaskill argue that there is no compelling reason for prohibitions related to security.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The restrictions also becomes more and more difficult to secure, as the use of the devices has become commonplace.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions off their devices.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Fau beginning to limit the use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of peach passengers for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry radiopriemniki - high-tech gadgets at the time.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The new airplanes are far more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation aircraft, but they also are being developed and approved FAA as resistant to electronic interference.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airline's offer to passengers using Wi-Fi at cruising altitude already within a few years.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The planes, modified for system, also more resistant to interference.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The vast majority ships fitted for wider use of electronic devices, according to the new guidelines, said Ward.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Today's electronic devices usually emit radio much lower power than the previous generation of devices.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Devices for reading electronic books, for example, emit only minimal signals when relisted pages.</seg>
		<seg id="37">But the signals are becoming more powerful, when devices download or send data.</seg>
		<seg id="38">Among those who pursued easing restrictions on the use of electronic devices passengers, was the company basis</seg>
		<seg id="39">In 2011, the company's representatives have downloaded an airliner with their own devices for reading electronic books the Kindle and flew on it, to check for problems, but never found them.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Members of the Advisory Committee of FAA expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices is a risk.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he believes interference from real devices, even if the risks are minimal.</seg>
		<seg id="42">The other members of the committee said that there is only one message pilots, confirming that the devices could interfere for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Nevertheless, the committee recommended that FAA allowed pilots to require passengers to disable the device during landings on components in limited visibility.</seg>
		<seg id="44">A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a lot of technological devices.</seg>
		<seg id="45">&quot;We are pleased that FAA acknowledges that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,&quot; said Roger Dow, the director general of the Tourist Association of the United States.</seg>

		<seg id="6">The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Antibodies trace any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker nicotine strike.</seg>
		<seg id="8">In tests vaccine mouse, which subsequently gave nicotine, continued their normal activities.</seg>
		<seg id="9">A mouse, which did not give the vaccine,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brain,&quot; the researchers said,.</seg>
		<seg id="10">These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Previous tobacco vaccine failed because they contained antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.</seg>
		<seg id="13">But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into factories antibodies.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Professor Crystal said that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it would have been to give children, will appear before they have the desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.</seg>
		<seg id="15">But more likely it will be used smokers to quit smoking.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;They will know that if they start smoking again, they do not get pleasure from that because nicotine vaccine, and it may help them get rid of this habit,&quot; he said.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for what they sneaked hand baggage on board his flight.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand baggage and $2 for coffee or gazing, although their announcement on Wednesday read that passengers will be able to leave the bank.</seg>
		<seg id="3">New hand baggage fee applies to bags in the luggage compartments, however small bags, placed under the seat, will remain free.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Frontier said it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelling will pay, only once at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A spokeswoman Kate Frontier On 'Melli said fee of $100 should make passengers take care about the payment in advance.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;We don't want to charge for it,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The airlines have begun to charge for a first and second bag done in baggage, in 2008.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The passengers, trying to avoid these fees, filling as much as they can, in hand baggage, page in the luggage compartments, causing in these compartments often do not have enough space.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Fees is one way to get passengers board less on board.</seg>
		<seg id="10">About 'Melli said that this new collection, in fact, not for the sake of making money.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The point is that the most loyal customers Frontier say they find a place in the top luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website, will have to pay.</seg>
		<seg id="13">This means that one passenger in line at the flight Frontier may get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.</seg>
		<seg id="14">About 'Melli said that the change in procedures on the web site and at check-in desks Frontier is intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they get to the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="15">New Frontier for hand baggage fee will not apply until the summer, although the date is not yet set.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but the airlines adore them.</seg>
		<seg id="17">They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service, should pay for it.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Many on Wall Street consider adding luggage fees sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But most of them were not hand baggage charges.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand baggage charge three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.</seg>
		<seg id="21">The only other airline with this collection is a Hungarian Wizz Air, a consultant on airlines said Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks extra fees.</seg>
		<seg id="22">In his assessment in the report from December 2011, gathering for hand baggage Spirit brings $50 million a year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he finds at the gate, where passengers will face an unusual collection Spirit for hand baggage.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;the boarding process was the most smooth of those that I have seen in his career in airlines,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="25">I expected to see gnashing of teeth and the emergence of fights at the gate.</seg>
		<seg id="26">The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing went rapidly.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Frontier also follows Spirit in respect of the $2 for coffee, tea, juice or Gaza.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Frontier said that passengers who receive gazing or juice, can leave yourself all the bank and that the coffee will be available for free.</seg>
		<seg id="29">She will still see distribute water.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Us Airways short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so in seven months, after passengers have started to complain and no other major airline did not follow its example.</seg>
		<seg id="31">The Frontier initiative to levy hand baggage fees when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline, is it the last measure to attract customers to its Web site.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The airlines pay onlinprodavtam tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.</seg>
		<seg id="33">It gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to purchase tickets directly from them, rather than turn in tourist onlinagentstvo.</seg>
		<seg id="34">But Frontier went further all in this area.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In September she started to give bonus miles in two times less often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through online travel agency.</seg>
		<seg id="36">On Wednesday she cut the number of miles to 25 percent from presale miles of travel.</seg>
		<seg id="37">So, the trip to 1,000 miles with Frontier, acquired the online travel agency, would get 250 miles.</seg>
		<seg id="38">In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site Frontier.</seg>
		<seg id="39">The Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becomes unprofitable.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Revenue fell 9 percent, and flight opportunities have declined by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results, published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.</seg>
		<seg id="41">Republic is trying to rectify finance Frontier as part of the sale of the airline.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Germany became the first European country that recognized the third floor in children born with the type of outdoor sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Newborn will no longer have to ascribe male or female sex.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The new law does not require parents to call any floor of such children, allowing parents to specify the floor as &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;unidentified&quot; in their birth certificates.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can take hasty decisions about operations by pre-empting sex newborn, and counter discrimination intersexual people.</seg>
		<seg id="5">One intersexual people, according to the BBC, said many years later: &quot;I am not a man and not a woman.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">I stay created doctors patchwork product with bruises and scars.</seg>
		<seg id="7">About one of two thousand children, EGRET annually, is neither a boy or a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="8">They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis &quot;disorders of sex development&quot; is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (nice or semis) or unusually razvivshimisya outdoor sex organs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Wallis Simpson, may have been intersexual.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The gender identification is still poorly understood, but most experts in the US say that, if the floor cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it, than to wait and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before the operation, if at all that happens.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, which specializes in issues of gender identification, said that the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="12">Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most of them children have not,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="14">You can assign to the floor without surgery and then see how a person develops.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The science of how a child will develop a gender identity, are not accurate.</seg>
		<seg id="16">No one can answer questions about why this is happening.</seg>
		<seg id="17">It is a mystery about why people are being homosexual.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The report sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersexual people as different from transgender or transgender, because their condition is relevant not to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not meet the floor is neither male nor female, and typically for both at the same time or not is not one of them.</seg>
		<seg id="19">These characteristics can manifest in secondary sexual signs, such as muscle mass, the distribution of the head, the chest and physique; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The report also gives a general idea about discrimination facing intersexual and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and crimes based on prejudice.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Boys with gender variations now have a special camp.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Australia and Nepal already allow adults to be male, female or a &quot;third gender&quot; in its official documents.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In June, a 52-year-old resident of Australia Norris MayUelbi became the first person in the world that recognized &quot;pole,&quot; octave in court the right to maintain &quot;uncertain&quot; sexual status for life.</seg>
		<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in German passports will be used in addition to M &amp; F - X, i.e. intersexual third designation.</seg>
		<seg id="25">In neighboring France gender issues still cause controversy, according to a news release on the channel France 24.</seg>
		<seg id="26">In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this &quot;gender theory&quot; pronounced Catholic countries have signed a petition for exemption from school textbooks.</seg>
		<seg id="27">American Catholic Online Web site also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is involved in a new state, where the floor is a matter of choice, and sexual activity - no, we perevorachivaem another two pillars of civilization.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="28">One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Web site Baby Zone that she would prefer that the children installed floor at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="29">&quot;raise a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of their child,&quot; she said the Web site for parents.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Children need stability and confidence.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Historically, children born with male and female sex organs, called hermaphrodites - on the beautiful Greek god, which had signs of both sexes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And yet just ten years ago the medical community vosprinimalo gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then draw again.</seg>
		<seg id="33">But now many contest ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that the gender identity complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive assigned him to the floor when they grow up.</seg>
		<seg id="34">&quot;in the middle of the 20th century, it was called &quot;urgent mental case&quot;,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="35">When the children were born, you called not psychiatrist - you rang the surgeon.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The dominant theory about how to deal with children with similar genitals intermediate type, was proposed by Dr. John Mani from at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easy to change.</seg>
		<seg id="37">He has put into circulation the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that the environment, including the social signals - the way parents raise the child, the child is interact with genes and hormones, determining whether a person considered himself a man or a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But in one case of 1966, known as the &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories were in question.</seg>
		<seg id="39">He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision, fully castrate child, also by removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but this was not the case,&quot; said Drescher.</seg>
		<seg id="41">When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.</seg>
		<seg id="42">But in 38 years he committed suicide.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Drescher said that now some doctors still &quot;apply this model.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these operations for a sex change, said about himself,&quot; with the result.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="45">This was the case and Jim Bruce, the writer's form from the state of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes A_____ B_____, but similar genitals intermediate type.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Doctors could not pinpoint whether he had a small penis or large clitoris, and were convinced that he will never be able to live a &quot;normal life&quot; men.</seg>
		<seg id="47">So soon after his birth in 1976 external genital organ and Bruce lyrics testicles surgically removed, and he was brought up as a girl.</seg>
		<seg id="48">He began the female hormones at the age of 12 years.</seg>
		<seg id="49">&quot;I knew that I'm not a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.</seg>
		<seg id="50">I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions.</seg>
		<seg id="51">He was appointed vaginoplasty in 18 years.</seg>
		<seg id="52">But while in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he required medical documentation.</seg>
		<seg id="53">What he learned was terrible.</seg>
		<seg id="54">I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.</seg>
		<seg id="55">Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not give him the body to produce testosterone enough for the normal development of genital mutilation.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing his chest.</seg>
		<seg id="57">The operation made him infertile.</seg>
		<seg id="58">Today he serves in the defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to lead a normal perception of people with intersexuality.</seg>
		<seg id="59">But Anne TemarMettis, executive director of the California Faculty Association Advocates for pub Choice, concerned that a German law &quot;urges however shortcuts and stigma.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="60">&quot;Many activists are concerned that a German law would encourage parents to make a hasty decision and to give the child &quot;uncertain&quot; floor,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="61">We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.</seg>
		<seg id="62">We believe that it is better to gain male or female sex, and then wait.</seg>
		<seg id="63">But we have not yet seen, as manifest themselves this law, so all we can do is to build the assumptions.</seg>
		<seg id="64">TemarMettis said her organization supports the Australian law, because &quot;it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third floor.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="65">&quot;adult people should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexual identity,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="66">The German law implies its assignment at birth.</seg>
		<seg id="67">This is the battle, in which young children do not have to enter at this stage.</seg>
		<seg id="68">When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.</seg>
		<seg id="69">But Dr Arlene Baratz mammologrentgenolog from Pittsburgh, which have a daughter in violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law &quot;support&quot; of both parents and children.</seg>
		<seg id="70">Bart daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called &quot;full nechuvstvitelnosti syndrome to androgens.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="71">Because of its androgenic receptors work incorrectly, Cathy have developed female characteristics.</seg>
		<seg id="72">She has the vagina, but not of the uterus and ovaries.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Now, in 29 years, Kathy married and passes residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Despite the fact that she was infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.</seg>
		<seg id="75">The law gives parents the time not to take any hasty decisions for themselves,&quot; said Bart.</seg>
		<seg id="76">He gives them time to make any tests and understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="77">In this case you in order to raise a child, like a child.</seg>
		<seg id="78">You have a child, and you feel the joy.</seg>
		<seg id="79">We do not need hastily to do the operation, which is irreversible.</seg>
		<seg id="80">&quot;This allows children to participate in the solution and eliminates the excitement that is driven by parents, because they do not feel that doing the right thing,&quot; she said.</seg>
		<seg id="81">In the end the child decides what floor he or she is more comfortable, and it's wonderful.</seg>
		<seg id="82">It gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.</seg>

		<seg id="1">On Thursday the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended enforcement of court rulings requiring changes in the program &quot;ostanovityiobyscaty&quot; New York City Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Second US District Court of Appeal said that the decisions of the judge Shira Scheindlin will be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal lodged the city.</seg>
		<seg id="3">In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in how he performed a program on street detention and interrogation.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The city appealed on its decision and orders of corrective measures, including a requirement to appoint the controller to help police squad to change work practices and training program associated with it.</seg>
		<seg id="5">On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate of the parties on the request to suspend the case.</seg>
		<seg id="6">The Court of Appeal said about the need for the withdrawal of US judges due to the fact that she had violated the code of judicial conduct and not poschitalasy with the need to avoid demonstrations bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements that contain public response to criticism of the court.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The judge ruled that police officers have violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unjustifiably turning to black and Hispanic on the program &quot;ostanovityiobyscaty.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">It has appointed an external controller to oversee major changes, which include reforms in the field of policies, training and control, as well as decided to launch a pilot program on zakreplaemsh testing on the body of video cameras in police stations where there is most of the detentions.</seg>

		<seg id="13">In 2004, four people, all - representatives of national minorities, a collective lawsuit filed in court.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Supporters of the changes in the program &quot;ostanovityiobyscaty&quot; in New York City Police Department say that these changes will end the unfair practice, form a more reliable and effective police service and may affect the way other police departments realize this practice.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Opponents argue that the changes reduce police morale, not the crime rate, would lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve a global problem of difficult conditions in police custody because of the reduction of the number of officers at several thousand over the last decade.</seg>
		<seg id="16">The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of &quot;ostanovityiobyscaty,&quot; which is in line with the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.</seg>

		<seg id="1">The federal government insists that the rescue package in the amount of $325 million for Tasmania's weakened health will be supplemented with tough conditions that guarantee that the state government spends money wasted.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent measures&quot; to prevent the crisis caused by the aging of the population of the island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.</seg>
		<seg id="3">The decision was adopted on financing within four years after the government's consultation with independent deputy Tasmania's Andrew Wilkie.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;The government has proposed an emergency rescue package of measures, which, we believe, will solve specific problems, standing in front of the state,&quot; said Ms. Plibersek today.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The size of the $325 million package includes $31 million at blitcampaniu on routine operations.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and operations on cataract removal, will help to overcome the backlog.</seg>
		<seg id="7">There is also money for clinics taking patients without reservation, in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of care after flap, training of medical professionals, mental health services and systems implementation personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.</seg>

		<seg id="1">I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope to change</seg>

		<seg id="5">Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the medical faculty at Harvard University.</seg>
		<seg id="6">I read terribly sad book in these days.</seg>
		<seg id="7">I thought that this book will inspire me in times of gloom in the second year of the medical faculty and restore a sense of hope in me.</seg>
		<seg id="8">It is called &quot;the temerity to win,&quot; and it's memoirs about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.</seg>
		<seg id="9">The evening when I finish writing reports on my patients and go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people, and performances could capture the spirit.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The election victory was impressive, and leading news programs did pause for reflection of this historic moment.</seg>
		<seg id="11">My classmates wept with joy, and my parents lacking all newspapers that they could only find.</seg>
		<seg id="12">The White House had come a young team strategists, and the nation was ready for change.</seg>
		<seg id="13">During Obama's accession to the post in 2008, its level of support was 82%.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Then I close the book.</seg>
		<seg id="15">A return at present is a rude awakening, as vding of dreams.</seg>
		<seg id="16">It's hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.</seg>
		<seg id="17">For years that have passed since then, as I lowered my first ballot, change is indeed occurred.</seg>
		<seg id="18">It was something that I could not even imagine.</seg>
		<seg id="19">I give Obama credit for its large and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on medical care available to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; rule, the killing of Osama bin Laden.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Moreover, I believe that the party obstructionism has blocked attempts to move our country forward: Immigration reform, too much choice of public health and the closure of the base in Guantanamo among others.</seg>
		<seg id="21">But after countless number of times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending her in front of colleagues and peers, I ended the explanation that I can provide.</seg>
		<seg id="22">I have reached the point of political despair.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Republican obstructionism could not explain the resolution on the Departments of foreign leaders or strikes pilots on innocent children in other countries.</seg>
		<seg id="24">He cannot explain the collection of data about the private lives of Americans or prosecution National Security Agency whistleblower, outlines the government's misconduct.</seg>
		<seg id="25">He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or failure to comply with public financing and spending limits during the presidential campaigns.</seg>
		<seg id="26">He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, in which the White House said that pricladyvaemse efforts to silence the media, are &quot;the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">And the last time he cannot justify what you cannot develop a Web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on medical care available.</seg>
		<seg id="28">I don't know whether I do this was to be expected.</seg>
		<seg id="29">Whether I was at the age of 18 years to understand that the leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede him?</seg>
		<seg id="30">It is obvious that work for elective office is not predictable program of action, because our public dialogue will form an opposition political party and random events such as the carnage in Newtown.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Yet for all I have listed above examples we see that they were largely the administration's own choice.</seg>
		<seg id="32">And that's what worries me the most.</seg>
		<seg id="33">I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.</seg>
		<seg id="34">Mitt Romney was a strange and brutal alternative, it seemed that he is not in a position to make a decision on its own policy or views.</seg>
		<seg id="35">I believed that Obama in his second term, freed from the pressure of future elections, meets, of which we have heard for so long.</seg>
		<seg id="36">However, when this week Obama's rating fell below 45%, to return in 2008 through this book has become much more difficult.</seg>
		<seg id="37">This makes me pine for many promises that letched.</seg>
		<seg id="38">This week I read that part of the book, in which describes how Clinton dealt Obama a resounding defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.</seg>
		<seg id="39">At the meeting to analyze the reasons for the setbacks he has told its employees that they should go back to normal and remain true to its purpose.</seg>
		<seg id="40">&quot;I want to make sure that we returned to our appeal,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;We should remember who we are.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="1">Mohammed Morsi takes the oath, but his day celebrations is unlikely to be sad an end to political strife in Egypt.</seg>

		<seg id="3">At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.</seg>
		<seg id="4">He took an oath before 18 judges in black were in the court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple.</seg>
		<seg id="5">&quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during the ceremony, shown live on state television.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability,&quot; said Morsi, 60th engineer with American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of the 84 years of its existence was banned organization, which target for tough action changed each other's governments.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Hundreds of soldiers and police guarding the building, when Morsi arrived with a small procession shortly after 11 a.m. local time.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the court building, to welcome the new president, and, in contrast to the days of Mubarak's presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time, to miss its civilians at the normally busy road connecting the city center with southern suburbs.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Although Morsi ridiculed as &quot;spare wheel&quot; uncharismatic &quot;Brothers,&quot; his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and panic speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only Islamists, but all those who want to bring to the business end of the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian.</seg>
		<seg id="10">&quot;Egypt today is civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with red tie, judges in the hall, where he took an oath obesity wooden panels.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Later Morsi headed Cairo University, where he was to speak in his inauguration speech.</seg>
		<seg id="12">He was the initial official reception with military orchestra, other state anthem, during which he stood at attention.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">Attended a military figure the Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.</seg>
		<seg id="14">His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;Army and the people are one hand&quot; who chanted hundreds gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s, has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising was born, zavershivshee Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and has promised to return the president's powers, which his office was deprived of the military council, who undertake the affairs of the deposed leader.</seg>
		<seg id="17">But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, not in front of the parliament, as it is accepted, he performs the will of the military, and this is a sign that the power struggle will continue.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.</seg>

		<seg id="16">Always there was internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.</seg>
		<seg id="18">The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the fetters imposed on the national economy through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to the idea that the project &quot;Europe&quot; has gone too far.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The euro crisis little to do with the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, - it was only fair for Greece.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In fact Eurosystem blocked their members on exchange rates, favorable for German exporters, is that German politicians and want to save.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency southern Europe is at a disadvantage to manufacturing capabilities in comparison with Germany.</seg>
		<seg id="22">The only saving means - to cut wages and government spending that is actively supported Berlin.</seg>
		<seg id="23">For the current budget problems and a currency worth a deeper problem, Europe's productive capacity.</seg>
		<seg id="24">As a result of the complex of measures to &quot;green&quot; energy, embedded Brussels, a cipher, meaning subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, is the European industry pays twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="25">This paralyze adverse price terms, as we have seen in Grangemouth.</seg>
		<seg id="26">No freezing salaries in the world will not be deterred crushing victory cheap US shale gas over European petrochemical industry.</seg>
		<seg id="27">As a result of incorporation of the revolt, especially in France, once the probably stone EU.</seg>
		<seg id="28">After the war the French political elite regarded the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.</seg>
		<seg id="29">But Berlin is no longer needs in Paris as a tool of political legitimacy, and Europe has already imposed its own economic policy, leaving destroyed France's economy in a mess.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The result is right, acting against the EU's Marine Le Pen of the National Front party just won the decisive extra election, violently the ruling Socialist Party in third place.</seg>
		<seg id="31">&quot;front&quot; is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning British Labour about the fact that you cannot proceed from the assumption that the split among the right will automatically be dropped in favor of the left.</seg>
		<seg id="32">What makes Le Pen with his newly inherited popularity among French white working class?</seg>
		<seg id="33">She wants to use the elections to the EU in the next year, in order to create the bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.</seg>
		<seg id="34">If - and this is very likely - are configured against the EU's party will get support in this election, the bloc will be able for the first time to take a dominant position in the European Parliament.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Here's my opinion: The growing sentiment against the EU and against a single currency in Europe soon merge together, to destroy the euro.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The EU will not go away, but he will again become something like blurred &quot;European sovereign nations,&quot; which enjoyed of General de Gaulle.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Germany and several economies dependent on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.</seg>
		<seg id="38">I guess the United Kingdom reproduction of this project, hoping to move closer to the United States.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Yet the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific points to the likelihood that the United Kingdom will remain unaddressed in the cold Atlantic.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In what position this leaves Scotland?</seg>
		<seg id="41">We can choose to become a region (essentially) Minor England.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Or we can to protect their own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send in Berlin and Brussels a handbasket.</seg>
		<seg id="43">I suspect that Scotland can succeed in the framework of a free European agreement provided that we keep its currency.</seg>
		<seg id="44">Cooperation with other stranamiedinomyshlennikami will be easier in federal Europe of nations.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of a repeat of the experience of Norway and the preservation of our economic independence.</seg>
		<seg id="46">The Scottish Nationalist Party government in Scotland is - ironically - the most successful political movement in Europe aimed against austerity, received a majority of votes in 2011 due to objections against spending cuts proposed (and sold) Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Aleister Darling and effective later coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.</seg>
		<seg id="47">Scotland would now be absurd to vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.</seg>

		<seg id="1">African and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white likely, studies show.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation close</seg>
		<seg id="3">There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals to blame</seg>
		<seg id="4">Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity may be one of the starting mechanisms early puberty</seg>
		<seg id="5">The trend toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys</seg>
		<seg id="6">Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge - a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Whether the mother put, if her daughter are beginning to form the beginnings of breast and lobe hair grow 7 or 8 years old?</seg>
		<seg id="8">At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes quite prevalent among American girls and represent a new norm.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I spend a lot of time, still parents - usually does not mean a complete puberty,&quot; said rapid offensive Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, lobe and provides the hair and body odor, appear before in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But it was only a small shift in the age of the first period (menarche) over the last four decades.</seg>
		<seg id="12">In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has decreased compared to 12,75 in 1970.</seg>
		<seg id="13">&quot;after the chest starts to grow, at least two or three years to menarche passes,&quot; said Kaplitt, also is the author of the book &quot;early puberty in girls: How to cope with this common problem.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="14">Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.</seg>
		<seg id="15">There is debate about what is the actual offensive sexual maturity, but is considered to be &quot;premature,&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.</seg>
		<seg id="16">In most cases, the process will slow or will slow down is that the pediatrician can monitor carefully.</seg>
		<seg id="17">More rapid progression can serve as the basis for analyses have endocrinologist, in order to avoid serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.</seg>
		<seg id="18">There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: Premature aging bones, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in mature age.</seg>
		<seg id="19">Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy is based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth and emotional maturity.</seg>
		<seg id="20">The psychosocial aspects are also important.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Kaplowitz careful with drugs, but acknowledges that &quot;the suppression of puberty may mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="22">Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don't want to have them very young daughters were menstruation.</seg>
		<seg id="23">&quot;They are worried about the risks of pregnancy or even how they cope with health issues,&quot; said Kaplitt.</seg>
		<seg id="24">&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls one woman, whose daughter menstruation began in 10 years.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.</seg>
		<seg id="26">She came home from school frightened and frustrated by the fact that she was the first among his friends.</seg>
		<seg id="27">There are lots of muchheralded theories about the causes of early puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="28">Yet there is no consistent evidence of what is to blame hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual statements in the media.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The boys - like puberty in girls have come earlier.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Kaplowitz argues that the premise, which has the greatest weight, is an epidemic of obesity.</seg>
		<seg id="31">In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of fat in the body with terms of puberty.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Other data confirm that conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.</seg>
		<seg id="33">In this country African and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach puberty earlier than their white likely.</seg>
		<seg id="34">There are various explanations.</seg>
		<seg id="35">All over the world to early puberty, apparently, affects everything from economic conditions and climate change to genes.</seg>
		<seg id="36">Another mystery: Although the boys have hair on the face and the lobe appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early sexual refurbishment is not as pronounced as in girls.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Other doctors, AAP participating in the conference, confirmed the complexity of the subject.</seg>
		<seg id="38">The appearance of acne and pubic hair found even in infants and children of the nursery age.</seg>
		<seg id="39">&quot;We must be careful about how we define the true offensive puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.</seg>
		<seg id="40">Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from pediatrician about how to talk with their child.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;It may mean earlier than expected, the conversation,&quot; explained Kaplowitz.</seg>
		<seg id="42">If you keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well.</seg>
		<seg id="43">Girls who bloom early, you need proof that even when this happens sooner than we needed, this process is a normal part of life.</seg>

		<seg id="4">Speaking via video link on open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said, &quot;there is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government actually took some of the things on autopilot, because such a possibility existed - and during World War II, and in very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, September 11.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="7">The only thing I am looking for every Halloween is trends.</seg>
		<seg id="8">The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion spent on costumes go away</seg>
		<seg id="9">This year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Women will no longer be the representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or marks.</seg>
		<seg id="11">As for the men, I think we will see a lot of zombies thanks to &quot;hodyachim serves,&quot; and I am sure that the astronauts in the style of a group of Daft Punk will in our tapes work this year.</seg>
		<seg id="12">According to Google, the costumes, which are more often than not, is a zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.</seg>
		<seg id="14">We did our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only one.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Moreover, according to the National Federation of retail trade, Americans will spend $330 million in this year on the costumes for pets.</seg>
		<seg id="16">This means a lot of funny sobacchotdogov.</seg>

		<seg id="22">The only thing that we do not want to eat, is a candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association confectioners, nearly 35 million pounds sold them for Halloween.</seg>
		<seg id="23">This is about 9 billion separate corn tiny grains.</seg>
		<seg id="24">This is the puzzle, which I have yet to unravels.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween as a haunted house.</seg>
		<seg id="26">They have tremendous names, such as &quot;Horror outside &quot;(which, by the way, is in a real prison), &quot;Howl and cry&quot; and &quot;House of the shock.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="27">Moreover, according to the society America Haunts, in America have 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses, generating about $500 million of income, as well as the stunning photos, where you're almost opiate that your friend posted on Facebook, and you cannot remove, then the guy who you like, sees this picture and leave a comment like &quot;cool expression.&quot;</seg>

		<seg id="4">Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where the amount of household debt is growing - is such that ValueMax, where she spends her deal, on this week became the third of the MFA registered on the Stock Exchange of Singapore.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Credit on bail jewelry is not just the fastest way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalingan), but also almost as cheaply as unsecured bank loans.</seg>

		<seg id="7">However, pawnbrokers have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or evidence of salary and faster than banks can lend.</seg>
		<seg id="8">However millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnbrokers, because families are feeling the pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.</seg>
		<seg id="9">After five years of steady growth, that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans, pished loose monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnbrokers, to compensate for the reduction of income as their economies slow growth.</seg>

		<seg id="8">They wonder how in the next decade, you can go to the system, in which drivers pay for every mile of road they cars.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Thousands of motorists already taken for testing these black boxes, part of which have the function of satellite tracking.</seg>
		<seg id="10">It is really necessary for our country.</seg>
		<seg id="11">&quot;It is not the question on which we can be the right choice,&quot; said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state authorities miles, preseed every Californian automobilist, by 2025.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="13">The technology for this is already there.</seg>
		<seg id="14">The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funds for the construction of highways, funded by the expense of government taxes that Americans pay at petrol stations.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Americans already don't buy as much gasoline as before.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Cars passing more miles per gallon.</seg>
		<seg id="17">The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon, not appreciated for 20 years.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Politicians do not want to raise the tax even one cent at high prices for gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="19">&quot;tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save,&quot; said Lee Munnich, transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.</seg>
		<seg id="20">In his state was recently installed on cars 500 tracking devices for testing pile payment system.</seg>
		<seg id="21">&quot;this will be the best alternative in the long term,&quot; he said.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Sandy call this pile user fee.</seg>
		<seg id="23">It is no wonder that this idea attracts urban liberals because, with the help of taxes, it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.</seg>
		<seg id="24">The authorities in California could to this system in the course of development strategies to achieve targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to fight global warming.</seg>
		<seg id="25">But Bill Shuster, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said that he, too, is considering this system as the most viable long-term alternatives.</seg>
		<seg id="26">Followers of the free market in the fund &quot;Reason&quot; is also delighted of that force drivers to pay for each mile.</seg>
		<seg id="27">&quot;This is not a simple tax that will go away in a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of Political Affairs Reason.</seg>
		<seg id="28">People directly pay for what they receive.</seg>
		<seg id="29">This movement is also supported by two former ministers of transport of the United States, which in 2011 urged Congress to move in the direction of pil payment.</seg>
		<seg id="30">The US Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million last year, in which was attended by about 10,000 cars.</seg>
		<seg id="31">However, the House of Representatives leaders rejected the proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters, which in everyday life often have to come so many miles to get to work or to the city.</seg>
		<seg id="32">Several states and cities, however, are on the way on their own.</seg>
		<seg id="33">The most enthusiasm is manifested in Oregon, where to take part in the experiment in the country held 5,000 drivers.</seg>
		<seg id="34">These drivers will soon be pay per mile run state instead of a tax on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="35">In Nevada, a pilot project has already been completed.</seg>
		<seg id="36">In New York, he is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="37">Illinois probe it on a limited basis with the participation of the truck.</seg>
		<seg id="38">But the I-95 Coalition, which includes transportation departments Pennsylvania, East Coast 17 states, including Maryland, Virginia and Florida), studies, as they will be able to make these changes.</seg>
		<seg id="39">This concept has not received universal recognition.</seg>
		<seg id="40">In Nevada, where about 50 cars volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track them every step.</seg>
		<seg id="41">&quot;concern about the &quot;big brother&quot; and things like this is a big problem,&quot; said Allauddin Khan, head of strategy and management issues efficiency in transport department of the State of Nevada.</seg>
		<seg id="42">This was not what people wanted.</seg>
		<seg id="43">When the tests were underway, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warning on its website: &quot;will be very easy to turn these devices in a full-scale tracking devices.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="44">There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure, which will inevitably widen to store records of their daily movements of individual citizens.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Nevada is one of several states where difficult searches are conducted an inexpensive technology, which would have allowed state authorities to take preseed vehicle miles, but no information about the place and time.</seg>
		<seg id="46">If you can do it, Khan said, the public will feel more relaxed.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The search for this technology have led some state agencies to a young company in California called True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="48">Initially, the company did not support in collecting state taxes.</seg>
		<seg id="49">She sought out the emerging market of automobile insurance, in which drivers pay based on mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="50">But the device, which she tests, attract designers roads, because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, from time to time to be loaded by modem.</seg>
		<seg id="51">&quot;People will be more inclined to do so, if you have not spent their speed and not spent their location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.</seg>
		<seg id="52">There have been a few more errors in some of these pilot programs in the state.</seg>
		<seg id="53">There is much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.</seg>
		<seg id="54">In Oregon designers experimenting with providing drivers of different options.</seg>
		<seg id="55">They can choose the device with or without GPS.</seg>
		<seg id="56">Or they cannot abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that passing all residents of the state.</seg>
		<seg id="57">In other places are hoping to sell the idea of a wary public, forcing the device to do more, not less.</seg>
		<seg id="58">In New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop nalogooblagangee device, which will also take charge for parking meters, to provide the &quot;pay as pedal&quot; insurance and collect pool speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion.</seg>
		<seg id="59">&quot;motorists will involve the benefits they offer,&quot; said in the document urban design.</seg>
		<seg id="60">Some designers transportation systems, however, think about whether all the talk about pil payment are not just a huge otvlecaty factor.</seg>
		<seg id="61">In the city's transportation commission in the San Francisco Bay area, officials say, Congress would have been very easy to overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the construction of highways, raising taxes on gasoline.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Additional lump or annual tax would charge drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline, so they paid their fair share.</seg>
		<seg id="63">&quot;there is no need for radical surgery, when all you need to do is to take aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public relations commission.</seg>
		<seg id="64">If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about his private life and a variety of other things.</seg>

		<seg id="4">November 1, the deadline set by this organization based in The Hague to Damascus destroyed or &quot;made it unworkable &quot;all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow you to mix chemicals with poison gas and fill them with ammunition.</seg>

		<seg id="1">According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers secretly considered to replace Vice President Joe Biden candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the electoral list of 2012.</seg>
		<seg id="2">This discovery is the most striking sensation of all expected Mark Galperin and John Heilemann books about the 2012 campaign&quot; Bets doubled: The game has changed 2012.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="3">The publication of The Times obtained a copy of the works to the exit of the book and reported on Thursday night that the president's closest aides held &quot;extensive research in focus group discussions and public opinion polls at the end of 2011,&quot; to assess whether Biden's exclusion may help raise Sabbath hopes for Obama's re-election.</seg>
		<seg id="4">According to The Times political observer Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts by senior officials of the election headquarters and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House administration Bill Daily, assess what effect will vote on the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton's vice president.</seg>
		<seg id="5">A possible replacement was a mystery, carefully guarded in Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.</seg>
		<seg id="6">Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daily, former head of the election headquarters Obama's Jim go and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the replacement is considered.</seg>
		<seg id="7">The book &quot;Bets doubled&quot; claims that Daily was the initiator attempts to replace Biden, despite their &quot;close personal relationships,&quot; but ultimately abandoned this step, when their data showed that adding Clinton in the electoral roll not &quot;Obama's chances will improve significantly.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="8">In an interview with Martin Daily confirmed that the administration really considered to replace Biden Clinton.</seg>
		<seg id="9">&quot;I actively addressed for the consideration of so many things, and this was one of them,&quot; said Daily newspaper.</seg>
		<seg id="10">You have to remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape, so we thought: &quot;God, what do we do?&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">Although Daily described the study as &quot;the necessary checks,&quot; Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper representative that the election headquarters quite a lot invested in the study of whether the move would bring dividends on the vote.</seg>
		<seg id="12">&quot;campaign teams do not spend such sums of money on polls and focus groups, if they do not consider something seriously,&quot; said Martin in the AK 360.</seg>
		<seg id="13">What is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team studied to replace.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Martin told CNN that he asked Daily, whether his then boss knew about possible retasked.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Although Daily and said he doesn't think that the president was aware of &quot;a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that,&quot; &quot;may,&quot; Obama knew.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Martin added that &quot;Bets doubled&quot; does not give a clear answer to the question whether political sensing results have reached up to Obama's desk.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believes that Obama did not know about the study opportunities Biden is excluded from the electoral list.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Would lead the construction of TPU in Moscow</seg>
		<seg id="1">With each passing year the capital authorities promise to furnish more transportnoperesadochnyh knots (TPU).</seg>
		<seg id="2">Until 2020 is scheduled to enter into service 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="3">What actually is the project, assorted our correspondent.</seg>
		<seg id="4">A couple of months ago &quot;Smolensk&quot; ArbatscoPokrovskoy subway line have a construction fence.</seg>
		<seg id="5">The inscription is stated that the resettlement project node.</seg>
		<seg id="6">All of this was very strange, because next to &quot;Smolensk&quot; no land transport does not stop and, therefore, you cannot take on him.</seg>
		<seg id="7">To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to overcome some 130 meters, including ground transition through Carmanita lane.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Now, almost all &quot;Smolensk&quot; have finished.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Disappeared flower stall, demolished stand for newspapers, and asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by the residents.</seg>
		<seg id="10">That's the hub.</seg>
		<seg id="11">Transportnoperesadochnye nodes are plastic and capital,&quot; explains in the press service of the capital's transport department.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Capital TPU as long as it is not.</seg>
		<seg id="13">And billets suggest the construction of parking, the withdrawal of trade objects that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Actually, planet TPU even do not transporters, and professional blagoustroiteli from the department of major overhaul of the city of Moscow.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The transport unit is not necessarily complex design, explains the Higher School of Economics, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and transport policy Mikhail Blinkin.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Sometimes a roof over his head and the scoreboard operas about the time of arrival of transport.</seg>
		<seg id="17">Here, for example, the &quot;establishment&quot; metro have recently opened a full-fledged billets locations node.</seg>
		<seg id="18">Even without canopies, but with privatives parking lots and the scoreboard, indicating that when the bus comes.</seg>
		<seg id="19">But in pursuit of officials record in TPU all that neither once.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Back in 2011, the Mayor's Office planned to build all of these 151 node, 59 of them with capital construction.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Now in the plans until 2020 are up 255 TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="22">Of these some 200 promise to pass more this year.</seg>
		<seg id="23">Although in the city have TPU development program, has not indicated any qualitative criteria,&quot; Alexander Morozov concludes, co-chair of the public organization &quot;City and transport.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="24">Report on the number of objects, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.</seg>
		<seg id="25">The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: First - reducing the time transplantation, second - convenience.</seg>
		<seg id="26">First of all to change of transport, not going out in the rain.</seg>
		<seg id="27">In Moscow, the after-school TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.</seg>
		<seg id="28">A vivid example of the underground &quot;VDNH.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="29">Before suburban buses with Yaroslavsky highway came in the square in front of the main entrance at VVC.</seg>
		<seg id="30">Now they stop moved on the opposite side of the street Yaroslavsky focus.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Farther from the metro, much further from morels, but closer to residential homes.</seg>
		<seg id="32">The gift that residents do not want to bus station under windows and complained in every possible instance.</seg>
		<seg id="33">With capital TPU in Moscow had somehow immediately.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The first of them began to build five years ago in the underground &quot;Planner.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="35">The project is intended to have been a model.</seg>
		<seg id="36">And indeed is an example of how the node locations, bequeathed to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.</seg>
		<seg id="37">No, there are persons for buses, shed, not to go from the subway in the rain, and the three floors car parking spaces.</seg>
		<seg id="38">True, Khimkinsky trolleybus No. 202 and 203 in Moscow TPU places have not fundamentally.</seg>
		<seg id="39">Them as someone else's postponed away from the metro.</seg>
		<seg id="40">But the place under trade more left.</seg>
		<seg id="41">One only 32 clothing store, and in general have almost everything - from pet products to a car dealership.</seg>
		<seg id="42">Well, in fact, suddenly who of bus passengers will need to buy a new car in the road?</seg>
		<seg id="43">We have, when build capital TPU, for some reason always out shopping centre.</seg>
		<seg id="44">The situation reached its logical conclusion, as part of a parking lot recently decided to give it to the market.</seg>
		<seg id="45">Now on the third floor of the TPU &quot;Planner&quot; among razmechennyh parking spaces on the floor is brisk market.</seg>
		<seg id="46">Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and the security guards, angrily pogladyvangie on our photographer.</seg>
		<seg id="47">The node locations have finally turned into a bazaar.</seg>
		<seg id="48">The point is that before the subway &quot;Planner&quot; market, but it was demolished.</seg>
		<seg id="49">But in Prefecture traders regretted and go on privatives parking organization host.</seg>
		<seg id="50">All the same because of high prices there are always empty.</seg>
		<seg id="51">The same ridiculous that market demolished in order to build in its place... new billets TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="52">So here's rock.</seg>
		<seg id="53">The distance from the lobby metro subway &quot;Kaluga&quot; have to bus was 50 meters, said Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="54">After the construction of the trade center, allegedly TPU, distance has increased to 170 meters.</seg>
		<seg id="55">In order to get on a bus, you have to go through the whole mall.</seg>
		<seg id="56">After 22 hours, when it closed, have to circumvent it under the open sky.</seg>
		<seg id="57">However, construction on &quot;Player&quot; and &quot;Kaluga&quot; soon seem around the neck.</seg>
		<seg id="58">The mayor's office in the middle of September gradostroitelnozemelnaya Commission approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPU.</seg>
		<seg id="59">Four of them will be 25etazhnsmi, not counting two or three underground floors.</seg>
		<seg id="60">The monster will grow from underground &quot;Tushino,&quot; it will be 4187 thousand square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="61">Representatives of the railway stations Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU underground, have already told reporters: In future meetings raspolojitysya3 shops, hotels and apartments.</seg>
		<seg id="62">Officials argue that parking lot Zai mouth from a third to half of the square.</seg>
		<seg id="63">Take for example the &quot;people's&quot; garages.</seg>
		<seg id="64">Say, garage for 258 machinest, which recently built on the international street, has an area of 8015 square meters.</seg>
		<seg id="65">So, for parking at 2.6 thousands of auto &quot;PetrovscoRazumovskoy&quot; will need about 80 thousand &quot;squares.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="66">It is less one third from the machine that there are going to build.</seg>
		<seg id="67">Let one or two floors will be spent on any person for buses.</seg>
		<seg id="68">Remains of at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate.</seg>
		<seg id="69">And this, in a minute, almost two GUM.</seg>
		<seg id="70">If capital TPU stations and stations have build railway workers, then the rest of the site will be master metropolitans.</seg>
		<seg id="71">They also promised that there will be a lot of functional facilities, including hotels, offices and even sports halls.</seg>
		<seg id="72">By the way, in the department of Moscow's city property had reporters recently that develop the draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot to TPU to officials directly.</seg>
		<seg id="73">Without any competitions.</seg>
		<seg id="74">Because, they say, that transportation issues for the city is the priority.</seg>
		<seg id="75">Ideal TPU is, for example, &quot;Harvard&quot; station in Boston or &quot;Spadina&quot; in Toronto, is confident Alexander Morozov.</seg>
		<seg id="76">Trolley buses and trams there descend underground to the level of underground and distance approach from subway cars to trams is only 50 meters without access to the street.</seg>
		<seg id="77">Around any unnecessary trade.</seg>
		<seg id="78">But Moscow officials throws in the extreme.</seg>
		<seg id="79">Or will build nothing, or that otgrohaem 25 floors with offices and apartments.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, said Thursday on reducing net profit by 15 percent under the influence of lessives number of orders and deliveries of the planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its rail unit.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Located in the Montreal company Bombardier also published no data on flight testing its new CSeries aircraft and not provided new information about whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft will be performed in commercial operation to the next September.</seg>
		<seg id="3">After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, held about one and a half months ago, he flew only three more times that raises questions about whether the stage of testing on schedule.</seg>
		<seg id="4">The results were acquitted of forecasts and led to a fall in shares of more than 8 percent of the Toronto Stock Exchange.</seg>
		<seg id="5">Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered its rating from &quot;higher on Thursday as &quot;before&quot; as &quot;because of the belief that the growth of the shares is limited in the next quarter or two.</seg>
		<seg id="6">&quot;Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we, of course, disappointed profit indicators of the transport department,&quot; said Derksen in the review of the stock market.</seg>
		<seg id="7">We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders as it unfolds flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="8">Nevertheless, if in the coming months will not be announced new orders, we assume that the market will become more skeptical to the program.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Bombardier hopes that the family of the CSeries aircraft will allow her to win a seat in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.</seg>
		<seg id="10">The first prototype of the aircraft was introduced in March and made the flight in September for the first time after several months of delay.</seg>
		<seg id="11">But the firm order for the CSeries yet not too much - 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests, to check the company's assertions about the fuel efficiency and new liner potential efficiency.</seg>
		<seg id="12">There are only now 403 order and an agreement with 15 customers and operators.</seg>
		<seg id="13">CEO Pierre Beaudoin was confident that Bombardier will reach its goal in 300 firm orders by the time when the first aircraft will be launched in commercial operation.</seg>
		<seg id="14">On Thursday the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is progressing according to plan.</seg>
		<seg id="15">&quot;test model of the aircraft remained on the ground longer than expected,&quot; said Beaudoin during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests were planned on aircraft downtime and software updates.</seg>
		<seg id="16">All manufacturers plan to tests in different ways.</seg>
		<seg id="17">We decided to conduct the first flight and make a break on the upgrade, and so we did.</seg>
		<seg id="18">So will occur during the flight test program.</seg>
		<seg id="19">The second of five test samples should make a flight in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow him, as reported by the company.</seg>
		<seg id="20">Yet analysts skeptical statement about the fact that the first client will be able to start operating CSeries aircraft after 12 months after its first flight.</seg>
		<seg id="21">Bombardier said it estimates the commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.</seg>
		<seg id="22">&quot;This slow the pace of flight tests - at least, apparently, and corresponds to the domestic schedule Bombardier - reinforces our view that commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Derksen.</seg>
		<seg id="23">In the third quarter, Bombardier okonchivshemsya September 30, net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.</seg>
		<seg id="24">Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.</seg>
		<seg id="25">Gross profit decreased slightly, to $4.1 billion from $4.2</seg>
		<seg id="26">Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</seg>
		<seg id="27">The fourth in the world's largest aircraft maker reported that he has put 45 aircraft for the quarter that less than in the previous year - 57.</seg>
		<seg id="28">The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.</seg>
		<seg id="29">The portfolio of orders aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, unchanged from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="30">&quot;in the aerospace field results consistent with our goals, however, a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become unpleasant factor,&quot; said Beaudoin.</seg>
		<seg id="31">Gross income on cosmic direction fell 13 percent to $2 billion</seg>
		<seg id="32">Bombardier, the world's largest maker of trains, reported that gross income in this sector grew by nearly 11 percent, to $2.1 billion</seg>
		<seg id="33">The portfolio of orders in the transportation unit was $32.6 billion at September 30, slightly higher than from December 31.</seg>
		<seg id="34">The transport unit income negatively influenced the problems with the fulfillment of several large contracts.</seg>
		<seg id="35">Management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.</seg>
		<seg id="36">The company's shares Bombardier, which also announced that chief financial officer of Google Patrick Pichette will go down in the board of directors, fell by 8.5 percent to C $483 on trading in the middle of Thursday.</seg>
		<seg id="37">The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest competitor Bombardier, said Thursday about reducing quarterly earnings by 10 percent.</seg>

		<seg id="1">Two staff members of the YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children to allegations in 2011 against child care institutions in Caringbah worker Jonathan Lord, said the Royal Commission on sexual violence against children.</seg>

		<seg id="3">Chief Executive Director Philip Hair was asked about one case, when the YMCA worker was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and about another case, when the YMCA Caringbah Hall gym instructor was convicted of sex crimes against children under his supervision, in 1991.</seg>
		<seg id="4">Mr. Hair gale Furness, a lawyer, said the provider of aid commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.</seg>
		<seg id="5">He acknowledged that YMCA in an introductory speech to the commission also allowed the inaccuracy, arguing that &quot;external checks were YMCA, press that YMCA is in the forefront to ensure the safety of children.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="6">The commission evidence suggests that YMCA was notified that she received the second from the end of the four possible ratings based on the results of the audit quality, made by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.</seg>
		<seg id="7">Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA, when he was 21 years, admitted that he and digesting leadership made the miss newly-signed Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding of their commitments related to reports of violations of security policy staff of children.</seg>

		<seg id="9">He was imprisoned for at least six years.</seg>
		<seg id="10">But Mr. Hair rejected the suggestion that corporate ethics YMCA prevented employees to report violations Lord in the security sphere of children.</seg>
		<seg id="11">The employees testified that they observed violations, including what Lord was alone with the children, personally nursed them set them in his lap, said that he loves one of them and let them play their mobile phone.</seg>
		<seg id="12">Daniel Ockwell, which was led by Lord and asked to teach her child protection, because it is concerned about his behavior, testified that found Jackie Barnett, manager of guardianship over the children of YMCA in Caringbah, who was head of the Lord,&quot; is very frightening and often trudnodostupnoy.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="13">The executive director said that he does not accept the explanation employees about the fact that it was embarrassing to report on the situation of their senior leaders.</seg>
		<seg id="14">Rather, he said, their friendship with Lord led them from thoughts about the need to report it.</seg>
		<seg id="15">Mr. Hare said he presented the board YMCA New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization of the &quot;accident with Jonathan Lord&quot; not to provide information&quot; on the part of the staff, and the board agreed with him.</seg>
		<seg id="16">Mr. Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements was adopted shortly after the emergence of allegations the Director General of the YMCA guardianship over the children this year begin.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He said that it was intended to prevent damage evidence, but at the same time &quot;pereuserdstvovali&quot; and this decision poorly implemented.</seg>

		<seg id="0">Bin Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: Furthermore</seg>
		<seg id="1">You can safely say that New York is a place of birth stendapkomedii in America: Almost a hundred years ago pop artist Frank Faye, who entertainer in the theater of the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.</seg>
		<seg id="2">Innovation Fay eventually picked other, more recently, the New York comedy festival.</seg>
		<seg id="3">Created and curated Caroline Hirsch, founder stendapcluba Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and theaters.</seg>
		<seg id="4">&quot;most of these there started at Carolines, and then achieved more success, have reached a level when they are already too famous to act in the club,&quot; said Hersh.</seg>
		<seg id="5">We have created this festival as a way to continue to work with them.</seg>
		<seg id="6">This year's event includes performances Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as &quot;stands for heroes&quot; - a charity concert for military veterans in the annual muzykalnocomedia Madisonskvergarden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby appear among others.</seg>
		<seg id="7">With the extension of the festival has grown and the comedy world.</seg>
		<seg id="8">A few comedians participating in the festival this year, gained popularity by unconventional means, for example, thanks to the show on television channels like Comedy Central, FX and followed.</seg>
		<seg id="9">Nick was gained fame thanks to roles in comedy series on little-known cable TV (ostentatiously sabres &quot;League&quot; by FXX on fantasyfootball), and now leads his own sketches on Comedy Central.</seg>
		<seg id="10">Jenny Slate entered the cast as in &quot;Saturday night in a live broadcast,&quot; as in &quot;Parks and recreation areas,&quot; although most of all she is known for a series of viral videos &quot;Marseille - rack in boots.&quot;</seg>
		<seg id="11">And of all time, and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sly, focused on racial subjects Kamau Bell), is the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="12">One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg interview with Larry David.</seg>
		<seg id="13">Steinberg started as stendapcomic, but then became a successful director on television and in the movies, as well as unofficial historian comedy.</seg>
		<seg id="14">From 2005 to 2007 he was leading the show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.</seg>
		<seg id="15">The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.</seg>
		<seg id="16">&quot;this city - Larry is certainly a central element of all the work,&quot; Steinberg said.</seg>
		<seg id="17">He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks on a street between the two houses and think, &quot;that's if I stay at all without money, perhaps, I'm going to live here.&quot;</seg>
