# Potet

This is our training data.
We have represented it using d-sequences of depth 2.

* `potet/dseq2.doctext` contains the documents
* `potet/dseq2.files` simply lists wich files we've used

# WMT14

This is our test data.
We have again represented it using d-sequences of depth 2.

The directory `lists` simply lists which files we've used.
The directory `doctext` constains the actual documents.

You will find 3 language pairs:

* fr-en
* de-en
* ru-en

and a few systems for each language pair (e.g. `cmu`, `kit`, `rbmt4`, `onlineB`, `uedin`, `stanford`, `promt`) as well as the reference.
