"""
This module implements helper functions to deal with multiple documents stored in a single plain text file.

Not to lose document boundaries we use a very simple format:
    1) the header of a document is its first line, it starts with '#' 
    and contains space sparated key-value pairs
    keys and values are strings without quotes

    2) a document only contains non-empty lines

    3) an empty line separates adjacent documents

Example:

# id=doc1
This is a doc.
It has two sentences.

# id=doc2
This is another, this one has a single sentence.
