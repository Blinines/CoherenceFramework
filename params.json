{"name":"Karin Sim","tagline":"Involved in researching Discourse in Machine Translation, as part of the MODIST project with Sheffield University.  My work is specifically on coherence, and assessing this computationally in an MT context.  Interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning in general.

This involved interpreting for a variety of meetings which gave me a wide general knowledge and good analytical skills. My working languages were French, German and Finnish. \r\nI subsequently undertook an MSc in IT (Software and Systems) and worked as an analyst programmer. I have extended my\r\nsoftware development skills while working on a number of cutting edge products, ranging from smart card applications to Jini based information portals and, extensively, loan application portals. Having worked for startup companies, I have a wide, varied skillbase and a flexible approach to working. I have subsequently worked a considerable time on larger support and development teams, and interact well with people at all levels. \r\nRecently I have studied NLP and ML, with particular interest in developments in the field of Machine Translation. My background in languages, translation in particular, have given me insights into current developments in the field. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n“In its communicative function, language is a set of tools with which we attempt to guide another mind to create within itself a mental representation that approximates the one we have.” Scott Delancey","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
